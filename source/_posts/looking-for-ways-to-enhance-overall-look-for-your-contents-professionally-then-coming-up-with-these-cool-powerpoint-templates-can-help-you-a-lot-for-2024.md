## Part 1 What Is the Difference Between VR and AR?

Both AR and VR use a distinctive approach and consider different use cases. They work on the concept of bringing a simulated environment to the user. Both VR i.e. the virtual reality and AR i.e. augmented reality are technologies used to replace or enhance the real-life environment with the simulated one. Virtual reality is the replacement of real-life environments with simulated ones. Whereas, Augmented reality is the procedure of augmenting the real-life environment with the addition of digital elements to a live view. This can be done by the camera on a smartphone.

The main aim of designing AR is to provide detailed information to the user about the real world. Its whole design is done by considering and adding the elements of the real world. Whereas, virtual reality is an entirely different simulation. It completely replaces the real-world environment with the virtual world.

Even Though both technologies are the simulation of the real world, they use different components of design and also have distinct targeted audiences. The concept behind VR is to distance the user from the real world as much as possible. Whereas, the concept of AR works with the real world to create a simulated environment.

The use of an eye-covering headset and headphones is very common to make an illusion of the real world, in the case of VR. Whereas, AR is usually accomplished with a smartphone or tablet screen. Here, the camera of the phone is focused at a point to capture the live-streaming of a moment on the screen. The captured data is then prepared by adding some useful information.

The applications of VR are architecture and retail, training, product design, etc. Whereas, the applications of AR are diagnostic data, navigation information, repair instructions, etc. The availability of **ar video maker** also eases the task of the industries for the mentioned purposes.

Successful YouTuber

## 1\. Understand 'Success' Means

YouTube's success is based on the premise that all visitors need the same thing. Search, find, and leave as fast as possible. Kind of like a store. But YouTube visitors have much more diverse needs than you might think. Some come to watch short clips of cats doing silly things, others to view TV shows or how to learn an instrument, cooking, maintain a car, and so much more.

The way your success is measured is by the number of viewers you get onto your channel. No matter what kind of content you upload, whether it's about music, education, when you turn viewers into subscribers, dedicated fans, and supporters, that is how you can measure your success and how you can get as many new people through the door and make them stick around because they love what you do and what value you are to them. We are going more in-depth in the other stages of this article about analytics and measurements.

Understand What 'Success' Means

## 2\. Create Your Plan

When it comes to building a successful YouTube channel, consistency is super important. You are more likely to gain success if you have a well-thought-out plan and a strategy for uploading content. Instead of uploading once per month, try once per week if your time schedule allows it so your new viewers know when to expect a new video. Planning is super important because it will allow you to stick to a schedule. If you have a lot of time to create videos, people tend to get used to that schedule. Once you're planning becomes less structured because of lack of time, it can confuse viewers as consistency is important. People do not like change, or it will take time for them to get used to a new schedule, especially if it changes often.

![Creating Your Plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-03.jpg)

Create Your Plan

## 3\. Make Your YouTube Videos

After you created your plan, your strategy, and all the preparation, it is time to start filming! We highly recommend working with an upload schedule, so you know which videos to create and when they have to be finished. Try to have a good overall layout and theme for your videos from the start so people know who you are and what you do. Once you started filming you can continue the process and keep producing.

![Filmora Note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If you have less time, you can create more videos in one filming session so you have a bulk library you can release over the period when you don't have time for creating content.

![Making Your YouTube Videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-04.jpg)

Make Your YouTube Videos

It's highly recommended to write down a list of topics for videos so you can have your same recording set ready to go for whenever you start shooting. If you are able to keep a dedicated space to keep your set, that's a huge plus instead of having to tear everything down and setting up again each time you film and it gives your viewers a consistent idea of what they can expect any time new video releases onto your YouTube channel.

## 4\. Use Analytics to Improve

Some marketers could have an unhealthy relationship with analytics. They track too many of the numbers. Maybe we think we can prove any marketing campaign is producing results if there's an eye-catching percentage. But we all know that some metrics are a lot more revealing than other types of statistics.

We have listed 3 important types of metrics you have to study to truly understand your audience.

### ❶ Watch Time

The Watch Time is the total amount of minutes viewers have spent watching your content. It's a key metric because YouTube pushes videos and channels with higher Watch Times in their search results and recommendations section. YouTube does this because the more Watch Time a video has, the more engaging their algorithm knows it is and YouTube like to recommend videos that keep viewers as long as possible on the platform.

![Watch Time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-05.jpg)

Watch Time

In the Watch Time section, you can see the amount of Watch Time your videos have generated. You can also rank each of your videos by Watch Time and group your videos by styles, lengths and themes to determine your most engaging videos.

### ❷ Average view duration

Your Average view duration is the total Watch Time of your video divided by the total number of video playbacks, also including replays. This metric measures your video's ability to engage people. If your video can't engage new visitors, they'll jump off from your video quite fast, leaving you with an unimpressive average view duration. If you create a high-performing video, your Average view duration and total Watch Time will increase over time and boost your search and recommendations rankings by a lot.

![Average view duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-06.jpg)

Average View Duration

### ❸ Audience Retention

Let's talk about Audience Retention. If your video is longer than five minutes, and Audience Retention is more than 50%, you are going in the right direction. A hook is something that grabs a viewer's attention and will result in them staying longer on your video or browsing your other content. We recommend regularly reviewing your videos to ensure you aren't attracting visitors to outdated content. Older videos can turn them away and they may view your YouTube channel as less trustworthy or valuable as a source for the information that they are looking for. Updated videos are high-quality videos.

## Part 3 How to Make 3D Gifs in Videos More Textured

You can use GIF makers to create loops in videos you upload but the trick to making your 3D GIF stand out is about to be explained in the following.

**●** **Step 1:** Choosing an Image.

The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.

**●** **Step 2:** It should have a smart composition.

Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.

**●** **Step 3:** Become a content creator.

It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.

**●** **Step 4:** Making the split.

The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.

**●** **Step 5:** Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.

From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.

**●** **Step 6:** For the final touch.

Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.

**●** **Step 7:**  Enjoy your GIF.

Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.

**Bonus Tip:** Use **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** to easily edit your videos using amazing tools, filters and affects. You can then make cool 3D GIFs from the videos you make.

## Part 3 How to Make 3D Gifs in Videos More Textured

You can use GIF makers to create loops in videos you upload but the trick to making your 3D GIF stand out is about to be explained in the following.

**●** **Step 1:** Choosing an Image.

The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.

**●** **Step 2:** It should have a smart composition.

Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.

**●** **Step 3:** Become a content creator.

It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.

**●** **Step 4:** Making the split.

The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.

**●** **Step 5:** Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.

From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.

**●** **Step 6:** For the final touch.

Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.

**●** **Step 7:**  Enjoy your GIF.

Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.

**Bonus Tip:** Use **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** to easily edit your videos using amazing tools, filters and affects. You can then make cool 3D GIFs from the videos you make.

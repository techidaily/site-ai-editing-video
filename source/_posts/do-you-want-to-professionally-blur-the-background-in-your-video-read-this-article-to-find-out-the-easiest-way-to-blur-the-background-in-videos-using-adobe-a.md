## Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos

Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.

**Get The Best Video Editor** \- Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.

**Get The Length Correct** \- In today's world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.

**Start with a Bang** \- The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.

**Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours** \- When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.

**Graphical Objects** \- Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.

**Play Attention to Sound** \- Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.

**Proper Flow** \- The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.

## Part 6 How to Share Your Videos

In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.

Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.

## Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos

Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.

**Get The Best Video Editor** \- Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.

**Get The Length Correct** \- In today's world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.

**Start with a Bang** \- The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.

**Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours** \- When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.

**Graphical Objects** \- Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.

**Play Attention to Sound** \- Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.

**Proper Flow** \- The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.

## Part 6 How to Share Your Videos

In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.

Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.

## Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos

Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.

**Get The Best Video Editor** \- Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.

**Get The Length Correct** \- In today's world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.

**Start with a Bang** \- The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.

**Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours** \- When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.

**Graphical Objects** \- Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.

**Play Attention to Sound** \- Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.

**Proper Flow** \- The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.

## Part 6 How to Share Your Videos

In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.

Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.

**Get The Length Correct** \- In today's world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.

**Start with a Bang** \- The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.

**Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours** \- When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.

**Graphical Objects** \- Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.

**Play Attention to Sound** \- Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.

**Proper Flow** \- The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.

## Part 6 How to Share Your Videos

In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.

Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration.

### · Busy World

What if the video you want to watch is too long and you don’t have that much time? We are very busy in different aspects. For this purpose, it is essential to keep in mind that the educational video should be concise. The video must deliver the actual concept but in a short span of time.

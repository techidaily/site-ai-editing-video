## Part 1: The Need to Zoom Computer Screen

You've been looking at your screen nonstop, but you can't figure out what it says. You could find the answer you're searching for by zooming in on your computer. On your computer screen, reading small type might be too difficult at times. There are several fast and simple methods to magnify your whole screen or zoom in on a specific area, whether you're using a MacBook or a Windows 10 PC.

Many users who are utilizing the Windows desktop, reading text, or surfing the web claim that the screen suddenly becomes stuck on zoom. Having such huge icons, graphics, and text on your windows computer is annoying. You must zoom out on Windows in order to resolve this problem. Microsoft offers options for customizing desktop display settings, whether you want to keep the zoomed-in desktop or change the display settings. This might alter the settings for Windows' Magnifier magnification, desktop icon size, or screen resolution.

Additionally, depending on the programs and utilities you have open, your computer's desktop may sometimes resemble a broad landscape. Its size and expanse provide you a bird's-eye perspective of the landscape. It may become a little challenging to read what's on it, particularly if your vision isn't as good as it once was. Popular desktop operating systems like Windows 10 and macOS include features that enable you to swiftly and eagle-like zoom in on just what you need.

Similar to this, if you aren't careful and cautious while using your computer, you could accidentally activate a feature like its zoom function. If you're using a shared computer, another user may utilize the zoom feature to make it easier for them to see tiny type on the screen. In any event, learning how to zoom out once more will allow you to utilize your computer anyway you see fit. Tools that zoom in on the desktop and make icons seem bigger than normal include screen resolution, icon views, and Windows Magnifier. These tools provide the greatest personalized settings to optimize display since they are made to enhance monitor display by making images and text understandable.

## Part 2: How to Zoom in/out PC screen

Here are the top 5 methods to know how to zoom out on desktop or subsequently, how to zoom desktop screen. Use the easiest method for you from the guide below:

### Method 1: Using a Keyboard

To zoom out or in on a webpage or document, hold down the Ctrl key while pressing the - (minus) or + (plus) key. You may utilize the - and + keys on the numeric keypad as well as those adjacent to the backspace key.

Step1Using the handy keyboard keys listed below is one of the most common methods to zoom in or out just in a certain window, website, or program.

* Ctrl + (+) to zoom in.
* Ctrl + (-) will zoom out.

Step2You may keep holding down the Command key while pressing the - or + keys to zoom as much as you like. Go ahead and try it.

### Method 2: Touchscreen Method

You have access to yet another fantastic single window zooming option if you're using a laptop with a trackpad. Simply squeeze two fingers together or spread them apart on your trackpad to zoom in or out. The Touch Bar at the bottom of your screen may be made bigger and simpler to read by choosing "Enable Touch Bar Zoom." To try it out, all you have to do is touch and hold the Touch Bar.

Step1You may use a "reverse-pinch" motion on a laptop with a touch screen or trackpad to zoom in or out in a variety of programs as well as on the desktop. This is really simple and will work in most applications (including Microsoft Office apps).

![how to zoom desktop screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/touch-sceren-option.jpg)

However, this motion may not be supported by all applications. This functionality won't work if you've turned off gestures on your trackpad or touchscreen.

Step2Put two fingers together on the touchscreen or trackpad. On the trackpad, you should place two fingers closely apart (they may even be touching).

Step3Put your fingers together directly over the region you wish to zoom out on while using a touchscreen display to focus in on a certain area.

Step4On the trackpad, spread your two fingers widely apart. The chosen website or app will zoom out to show more content when your two fingers separate from one another on the trackpad or touchscreen.

### Method 3: Use Keyboard and Mouse Commands

Using the keyboard and Mouse shortcuts is the easiest method to zoom in and out desktop screen on computers. Follow the steps below to learn this technique hassle-free.

**Steps to Use Keyboard and Mouse Method:**

Step1To zoom in, scroll your mouse wheel up while holding down the Ctrl key. You may already use this to zoom in on your browser, for instance.

![how to zoom desktop screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/keyboard-and-mouse-method.jpg)

Step2Now for the Zoom out, hold the Ctrl key on the Keyboard and move the mouse wheel down to zoom out to the desired extent as shown here:

### Method 4: Use the Desktop Magnifier Feature

The magnifier tool allows you to temporarily increase the size of a specific area of the screen. It is a built-in function of the Windows family. The user may enlarge the screen with the use of the magnifying tool. This function is highly beneficial for those who have hazy vision as well as for enlarging the specific picture shown to viewers through projectors. The magnifier app's default view, Full Screen, may enlarge the whole screen. However, the user is unable to see the complete screen at once since a section of it enlarges and moves with your mouse pointer. By selecting the "Options" option, the user may modify the Magnifier app's settings and access a variety of additional capabilities. Anyway, let's get started to learn the processes.

**Steps to Use Magnifier to Zoom Desktop Screen:**

Step1Open the Windows search (a magnifier icon or a long search box on the taskbar). To launch Magnifier, enter "magnifier" into Windows search and then click the first result.

Step2The Windows 10 Magnifier window will appear. Then, at any moment, you may zoom in on your app, your web browser, or a few other applications by pressing the + button.

![how to zoom desktop screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/windows-magnifier.jpg)

Step3Press the Windows logo key and + to enlarge the view (plus). or use the Magnifier controls' + (plus) button.

Step4Press the Windows key and - to zoom out (minus). Or use the Magnifier controls' - (minus) button.

Step5Press Windows logo key + Esc to close the Magnifier. In the top-right corner of the Magnifier controls, click the X (close) button.

### Method 5: Web Browser Method

You may enhance your web browser reading experience in a number of different ways. One method is to zoom in on the online sites you wish to read and enlarge the text, photos, and icons. It's possible that you need to do this since your eyes are weary or the screen's quality isn't the best. To restore items to their original state, you may need to reset the zoom level or zoom out at some point. On Windows 10, you may zoom in for a clearer view of the screen if you can't read the text or the pictures on your computer screen.

**Steps to Use Web Browser Method to Zoom Desktop Screen:**

You may use the zoom in shortcut on any web browser to increase the browser's zoom level. In other words, you may zoom in on your web browser using the keyboard.

Step1Launch a web browser. To zoom in on your web browser, hold down the Ctrl key while pressing the "+" key on your keyboard.

![how to zoom desktop screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/web-browser-zoom-method.jpg)

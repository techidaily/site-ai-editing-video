Due to this, it has become easy to discover a niche on Discord as there are a lot of distinct servers that accommodate an extensive range of interests.

Each server is composed of multiple channels, and every channel has its subjects, individual rule set, and interests. Thus, every channel can be valuable to talk about different things:

The possibilities are endless, and the most crucial part is that it is free to create these servers.

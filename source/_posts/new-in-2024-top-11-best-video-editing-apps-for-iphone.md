Step 2: Open the Effects

Type Retro VHS in the search bar and click on the second result that is displayed. Click on the “Effects” that says, “VHS Retro.”

### Use the VHS Filter in TikTok

Step 1: Deactivating the Filter</p

With the camera open, click on “Effects” right next to the camera icon. The filter is activated, but we need to deactivate it by clicking on the stop icon with the effects. Click anywhere on the screen to exit the "Effects" panel.

Step 2: Recording Process

Now, click on the red video sign and begin recording for some seconds without the filter. It is important to record the video by pointing at the targeted person. After the first part of the video is recorded, head back to the “Effects” menu and navigate to the tab that says, “Add to Favorites.”

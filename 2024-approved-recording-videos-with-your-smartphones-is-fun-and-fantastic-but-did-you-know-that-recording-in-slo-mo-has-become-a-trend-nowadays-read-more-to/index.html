But Did You Know that Recording in Slo-Mo Has Become a Trend Nowadays? Read More to Learn About How to Convert Videos to Slow Motion Here</h2><p>Slow Motion films are unique, don’t you think? Occasionally, individuals use their phones to shoot slow-motion films if they have an in-built function, and if their phone does not have an in-built feature, they may use <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >slow-motion video creator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> applications to assist them.</p>
<p>But what happens if you have previously filmed a video at regular speed and now want the movie to be converted to slow motion?</p>
<p>Maybe a video of you from the pool when you’re flipping your hair, but no one remembers to take it in slow motion? Don’t be concerned! Today, we will show you how to turn any video into a slow-motion video on different operating systems.</p>

For example, you may use the Photos App pre-installed on Windows 10 machines to apply the slow-motion effect to your photographs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Right click the video and choose Open with Photos. If it has been recorded by an iPhone or Android device and stored up to OneDrive, it should appear in the Microsoft Photos app without any further effort. Just click it to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the <strong>Edit &amp; Create</strong> option on the right corner on the top, and then select <strong>Add slo-mo</strong> option.</p>

                      alt="add slo mo effect windows photos app"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using the slider, you can determine how slowly you want it to go. Microsoft has built-in support for “<strong>Slow</strong>“ and “<strong>Super-Slow</strong>“ performance levels. Drag the slide to the right end will trigger the super slow mode.</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="windows 10 photos adjust slow motion speed"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Specifiy the part that you want to apply slow motion in the playback bar at the bottom, and then save the video that you have just <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >created with slow motion effects on Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>The possibility exists that you are using an older version of Windows 10 on your computer if you do not see the option anywhere in the Photos app. You can also follow the steps above to create a slow motion video on Windows 11.</p>
<p>Browse Windows Update from the system menu and click on the appropriate button. When all of the updates have been installed, you will have the most recent version of the Photos app, which includes this functionality.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To add slow motion effect to part of the video, you need to split the video first and then right click it to choose <strong>Speed</strong> and <strong>Duration</strong>. There will be a pop-up window. The motion effects will be sped up or slowed down based on the speed values.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> When you increase or decrease the video playing speed, the video audio speed changes. If you wish to retain the video audio’s actual playing speed, you may first <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Detach Audio</strong> from the video</a> and then edit the video to achieve a perfect pitch.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: click on the <strong>Choose File</strong> option from the website to upload the video (max. 200MB).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now select the <strong>Speed</strong> of the video from the given options. Since we are going to make a video with slow motion effect, choose 0.5x or 0.8x will work perfectly.</p>

Here is how you can use CapCut to transform a regular video into a slow-mo one:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <strong>Create A New Project</strong> on the CapCut app’s home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: When you’re ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the <strong>Mute clip audio</strong> button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" mute video audio capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you just want to add a slo-mo effect to part of the video, you need to split the video accordingly. Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the <strong>Split</strong> button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the <strong>Speed</strong> menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-speed-menu.jpg"
                      alt=" speed option in capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Curve</strong>, respectively. You may just choose the “<strong>Normal</strong>“ option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video’s frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the <strong>Check</strong> box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" change speed  in capcut"
                ></p>
<p>Make a slow motion video at this stage to spice things up. CapCut allows you to add text, create transition effects, and more.</p>

For example, you may use the Photos App pre-installed on Windows 10 machines to apply the slow-motion effect to your photographs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Right click the video and choose Open with Photos. If it has been recorded by an iPhone or Android device and stored up to OneDrive, it should appear in the Microsoft Photos app without any further effort. Just click it to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the <strong>Edit &amp; Create</strong> option on the right corner on the top, and then select <strong>Add slo-mo</strong> option.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using the slider, you can determine how slowly you want it to go. Microsoft has built-in support for “<strong>Slow</strong>“ and “<strong>Super-Slow</strong>“ performance levels. Drag the slide to the right end will trigger the super slow mode.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Specifiy the part that you want to apply slow motion in the playback bar at the bottom, and then save the video that you have just <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >created with slow motion effects on Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>The possibility exists that you are using an older version of Windows 10 on your computer if you do not see the option anywhere in the Photos app. You can also follow the steps above to create a slow motion video on Windows 11.</p>
<p>Browse Windows Update from the system menu and click on the appropriate button. When all of the updates have been installed, you will have the most recent version of the Photos app, which includes this functionality.</p>

Here is how you can use CapCut to transform a regular video into a slow-mo one:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <strong>Create A New Project</strong> on the CapCut app’s home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: When you’re ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the <strong>Mute clip audio</strong> button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.</p>

Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the <strong>Split</strong> button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the <strong>Speed</strong> menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.</p>

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Curve</strong>, respectively. You may just choose the “<strong>Normal</strong>“ option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video’s frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the <strong>Check</strong> box.</p>

For example, you may use the Photos App pre-installed on Windows 10 machines to apply the slow-motion effect to your photographs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Right click the video and choose Open with Photos. If it has been recorded by an iPhone or Android device and stored up to OneDrive, it should appear in the Microsoft Photos app without any further effort. Just click it to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the <strong>Edit &amp; Create</strong> option on the right corner on the top, and then select <strong>Add slo-mo</strong> option.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using the slider, you can determine how slowly you want it to go. Microsoft has built-in support for “<strong>Slow</strong>“ and “<strong>Super-Slow</strong>“ performance levels. Drag the slide to the right end will trigger the super slow mode.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Specifiy the part that you want to apply slow motion in the playback bar at the bottom, and then save the video that you have just <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >created with slow motion effects on Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>The possibility exists that you are using an older version of Windows 10 on your computer if you do not see the option anywhere in the Photos app. You can also follow the steps above to create a slow motion video on Windows 11.</p>
<p>Browse Windows Update from the system menu and click on the appropriate button. When all of the updates have been installed, you will have the most recent version of the Photos app, which includes this functionality.</p>

Video may be recorded with a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >frame rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of 120 or 240 fps and then played back at a considerably slower rate than usual.</p>
<p>However, if you don’t record video on your iPhone, making slow motion out of videos shot on other cameras or devices is more challenging. The good news is that iMovie for Mac can do this for you. We’ll show you how in this guide.</p>
<p>Slow-motion films are easy to make <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >using iMovie on your Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Just follow the steps listed below.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the blue <strong>Import Selected</strong> button once you’ve selected the video file in the file browser to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You may now open the movie in iMovie. Creating a <strong>Project</strong> is required at this stage. To do so, click on the Projects option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you’ve entered a name for your project, click the blue <strong>OK</strong> button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> By dragging the movie onto your timeline, you may modify the video. Select the video by clicking on it and clicking on the <strong>Speed</strong> option to change its speed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: The speed-editing interface will be shown here. Change <strong>Normal to Slow</strong> in the Speed drop-down menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: The duration of your movie will be increased by halves the pace at which it was initially recorded. The video may be slowed down even further by moving the <strong><em>speed slider</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: Go to the Menu Bar and choose <strong>File &gt; Share</strong>. Select the file you want to share.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Click the blue <strong>Next</strong> button once you’ve selected the properties you want for the file.</p>

Using shortcut keys or hotkeys is one method, while menus and buttons are another. Both methods are OK, but the shortcut option is the quickest and most efficient.</p>
<p>Speed up and speed down buttons appear on the upper right of the movie when you press them. Depending on how much you tweak it, the speed is represented as 1.50x or 0.80x. This option is available for those who like to use other shortcut keys.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: From the VLC menu bar, head over to the <strong>Playback</strong> for <strong>Speed</strong> and choose a speed option: <em>slower, slower (fine), normal, faster (fine), and faster</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Right-clicking is also possible to access these parameters from the Playback &gt; Speed menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The video’s speed may be altered by selecting one of those options and then clicking the appropriate button.</p>

For example, you may use the Photos App pre-installed on Windows 10 machines to apply the slow-motion effect to your photographs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Right click the video and choose Open with Photos. If it has been recorded by an iPhone or Android device and stored up to OneDrive, it should appear in the Microsoft Photos app without any further effort. Just click it to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the <strong>Edit &amp; Create</strong> option on the right corner on the top, and then select <strong>Add slo-mo</strong> option.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using the slider, you can determine how slowly you want it to go. Microsoft has built-in support for “<strong>Slow</strong>“ and “<strong>Super-Slow</strong>“ performance levels. Drag the slide to the right end will trigger the super slow mode.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Specifiy the part that you want to apply slow motion in the playback bar at the bottom, and then save the video that you have just <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >created with slow motion effects on Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>The possibility exists that you are using an older version of Windows 10 on your computer if you do not see the option anywhere in the Photos app. You can also follow the steps above to create a slow motion video on Windows 11.</p>
<p>Browse Windows Update from the system menu and click on the appropriate button. When all of the updates have been installed, you will have the most recent version of the Photos app, which includes this functionality.</p>

<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: Go to the Menu Bar and choose <strong>File &gt; Share</strong>. Select the file you want to share.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Click the blue <strong>Next</strong> button once you’ve selected the properties you want for the file.</p>

Using shortcut keys or hotkeys is one method, while menus and buttons are another. Both methods are OK, but the shortcut option is the quickest and most efficient.</p>
<p>Speed up and speed down buttons appear on the upper right of the movie when you press them. Depending on how much you tweak it, the speed is represented as 1.50x or 0.80x. This option is available for those who like to use other shortcut keys.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: From the VLC menu bar, head over to the <strong>Playback</strong> for <strong>Speed</strong> and choose a speed option: <em>slower, slower (fine), normal, faster (fine), and faster</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Right-clicking is also possible to access these parameters from the Playback &gt; Speed menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The video’s speed may be altered by selecting one of those options and then clicking the appropriate button.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <strong>Create A New Project</strong> on the CapCut app’s home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: When you’re ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the <strong>Mute clip audio</strong> button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.</p>
<p><img

Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the <strong>Split</strong> button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the <strong>Speed</strong> menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img

                      alt=" speed option in capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Curve</strong>, respectively. You may just choose the “<strong>Normal</strong>“ option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video’s frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the <strong>Check</strong> box.</p>

Creators around the globe can interact with their followers from a single platform. It gives them a chance to share their ideas and showcase their talents. Hence, here is how slow-motion videos benefit a creator in his journey:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In Video Tutorials:</strong> Do you have a channel where you post tutorials to perform a specific task? This effect can help you slow down the video for the audience to absorb your words. It helps creators to show their viewers that they genuinely care about them. A video where basics and details are discussed is considered right.</li>
<li><strong>In Revealing Details:</strong> We encounter situations where the camera cannot capture a moment right. This is because the normal playback speed cannot highlight video details. On the other hand, a slo-mo takes proper time to showcase details. These help handle an event planning or dress designing page.</li>
<li><strong>In Creating Aesthetics:</strong> Another application of slo-mos is that they help with creativity. Adding this effect at the right time and duration enhances visuals. Moreover, adding a slo-mo effect gives the video an aesthetic appeal. It can enhance the visuals of a travel, cooking, or fashion video.</li>

They help them with enhanced learning by breaking down complex information. If you are creating slo-mos as a creator, here is how they are helping your viewers:</p>

A slow-motion video can break down a complex concept or steps for a recipe. In addition, it can help you operate technology better, like Word, Excel, and more.</li>
<li><strong>In Understanding Nature:</strong> People out there prefer documentaries over dramas. They are curious about nature and the way it works. In such documentaries, slo-mos are used to present a natural phenomenon. It helps the viewers understand how a certain process occurs. Moreover, it focuses on small details in an ecosystem to explain better.</li>
<li><strong>In Reflecting Content:</strong> Next time you watch reels, notice that slo-mos catch your attention. Videos with the right speed manipulation appeal to the eyes, and viewers often watch them again. In addition, they help focus on the specifics of a gadget, fashion product, or more.</li>

<h2 id="Best-Audio-Plug-Ins-For-Video-Editors"><a href="#Best-Audio-Plug-Ins-For-Video-Editors" class="headerlink" title="Best Audio Plug-Ins For Video Editors"></a>Best Audio Plug-Ins For Video Editors</h2><p>When it comes to improving the sound of the audio in your video editing projects, you have a variety of options to choose from when approaching the editing. Most plugins that we will cover today will be helpful for many different effects instead of only one particular one.</p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="1-Synchro-Arts-Revoice-Pro"><a href="#1-Synchro-Arts-Revoice-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. Synchro Arts Revoice Pro"></a>1. Synchro Arts Revoice Pro</h2><p>Let’s talk about Revoice Pro 4. This is an awesome plugin for when you are finishing complex editing projects when you work with dialogues and need to synchronize other lines to fit the shot. Revoice Pro 4 combines timing and pitch alignment technology, together with as a pair of cutting-edge tuning tools and a natural-sounding vocal doubler for people working on the narrator voice.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/synchro-arts-revoice-pro.jpg"
                      alt="synchro arts revoice pro"
                ></p>
<p>For the video editors working in audio post-production, the stand out new feature added to Revoice Pro is Smart Align combined with a fast workflow, meaning that you don’t need to leave Pro Tools to synchronize ADR to the location audio. Although Version 4.3 presented an ARA version of the Revoice Pro link plug-in for Logic Pro users, so providing immediate transfers back and forth between Logic Pro or higher Synchro Arts haven’t counted out Pro Tools users by preparing a new set of AudioSuite plugins.</p>
<p>The APT procedures, used to align the pitch and timing of multiple vocal tracks, now includes SmartAlign. When this is turned on, it can align audio with significant gaps in the guide or even dub the audio. This feature enables you to align much longer performances, which in the past had to be divided into smaller sections.</p>
<p> As Revoice Pro has improved over the years, the latest version is giving you the ultimate workflow it should always have had in the past. Synchro Arts have been able to create the perfect workflow with an AudioSuite plugin, that runs Revoice Pro in the background without having to have to switch back between Revoice Pro and Pro Tools. Select your audio and the desiredRevoice Pro preset, process the audio in Revoice Pro and place it directly into the timeline without having to leave Pro Tools.</p>
<p>Smart Align and the Quick APT AudioSuite plugin made this fairly easy, yet powerful, workflow. Synchro Arts has also been able to fix the tasks of how to handle gaps. Before V4.3, you had to make sure there weren’t any unexpected empty spots, or it was not able to work out what to do. Using Smart Align, it handles the gaps without any problems.</p>
<p>Whether you need to tighten any kind of pitch or timings on a vocal recording, Revoice Pro is the one for you. Revoice Pro is great for working with vocal recordings, but it’s perfectly suitable for instruments like guitars and strings too.</p>
<p>Synchro Arts Revoice Pro is available for $599.</p>
<h2 id="2-Red-Giant-Magic-Bullet-Colorista"><a href="#2-Red-Giant-Magic-Bullet-Colorista" class="headerlink" title="2. Red Giant Magic Bullet Colorista"></a>2. Red Giant Magic Bullet Colorista</h2><p>This is a very interesting plugin. Colorista tries to cancel out the need for a separate color-specific program by increasing more color correction options. This plugin allows you to have more color control with tools for tints, temperatures, vignetting, RGB curving, and so forth. Colorista contains a three-way color function and support for LOG clips and LUT filters. Colorista is not a stand-alone program. It’s designed to integrate into existing software and offer better functionality. Plugins let you design something that wasn’t there originally. You don’t have to load a certain project to activate them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="red giant magic bullet colorista"
                ></p>
<p>For years, Red Giant has been one of the biggest developers of plugins designed for video editing software. Among the other ones is the Magic bullet suite, which contains quite some plugins to solve video noise problems and do some color grading. We believe the versatility of Red Giant allow content creators and movie producers to let their ideas come to life, create dynamic art and create better content overall.</p>
<p>Even though Red Giant’s Magic Bullet Suite is a plugin suite created for Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro, it also works with other video editing software such as VEGAS Pro. The suite focuses on color correction and color grading improvements. VEGAS Pro is my software of choice, but one aspect of Premiere that I’ve always thought inadequate were the color correction tools. Looks is completely customizable, and a “preset” can be built up from zero. The Colorista suite comes with a lot of other plugins that have crucial roles in the color grading aspect of video editing. Denoiser II is ideal for clearing up scratchy footage.</p>
<p>Red Giant Magic Bullet Colorista is available for $199.</p>
<h2 id="3-Boris-FX-Continuum-2022"><a href="#3-Boris-FX-Continuum-2022" class="headerlink" title="3. Boris FX Continuum 2022"></a>3. Boris FX Continuum 2022</h2><p>The thriving film industry’s filmmakers choose Boris FX Continuum. This package contains super strong, timesaving plugins for a smoother workflow with seventeen effects and quick fix plug-in options. Continuum Includes over 200 effects and more than 3500 presets. Each pair will be suitable for each project. Continuum 2022 is the latest biggest release of the post-production plugin collection. The release includes 6 transitions, 4 effects and nearly 100 professionally developed templates. It’s definitely worth checking it out!</p>

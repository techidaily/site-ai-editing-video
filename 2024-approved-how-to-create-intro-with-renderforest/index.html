<h2 id="Tutorial-on-How-to-Create-an-Intro-Using-Renderforest"><a href="#Tutorial-on-How-to-Create-an-Intro-Using-Renderforest" class="headerlink" title="Tutorial on How to Create an Intro Using Renderforest"></a>Tutorial on How to Create an Intro Using Renderforest</h2><p>Professional video creators are likely aware that starting a video without a suitable introduction is equivalent to sneaking into someone’s house without permission. A good intro is a doorbell to let people know you’ve arrived.</p>
<p>A strong introduction ensures that more people will view your film. Adults have an attention span of about 12 seconds, according to studies from 2000. It is now only 8 seconds. You have 8 seconds to entice viewers to watch your video, so don’t waste it. A captivating introduction will give your content a professional touch and pique your audience’s interest. This task is worthwhile if you want to advertise your videos successfully.</p>
<p>These days, you don’t necessarily need to hire a pro to make a film if you need one. The majority of the available tools are free. We’ll demonstrate in this lesson how to use Renderforest to create a polished video intro. Our intro maker will let you start strong, whether for a fun birthday video or commercial use.</p>
<p>When you’re prepared to begin producing your videos, go to Renderforest, register for an account, or sign in if you already have one.</p>
<p>Check out the vast selection of templates under “<strong>Intros and logos</strong>“ in the “<strong>Create Video</strong>“ section of the navigation menu. Here, you can select the intro you like most and begin altering it, or use our advanced search filters to locate the specific content you require.</p>

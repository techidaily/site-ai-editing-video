It means you can have different feather values for different parts of the same mask. This feature gives you greater control and flexibility over your masks, allowing you to easily create complex effects and transitions.</p>
<p>With variable mask feathers, you can create complex effects, such as a shape that feathers more in one direction than the other. Or you can create a mask with a soft transition in one area and a hard transition in another.</p>
<p>By experimenting with different feather values and mask shapes, you can achieve a wide range of creative effects in After Effects. To use variable mask feather in After Effects, you’ll need to follow these steps:</p>
<p>Step1 Use the pen tool to create corner points.</p>

Not many video editors are available where you can add the echo effect instantly from the available sound effects and presets. That is why we have handpicked the best video editors for Windows PC and Mac users. You can also add echo effect to video online from any device directly from your web browser.</p>

TwistedWave is one of the few online video editors that allow you to add echo effect to your video. Here are the steps how to add echo effect in video online.</p>
<p>Step 1Open your web browser and visit “twistedwave.com&#x2F;online”. Click on Upload a file button to upload your video file.</p>

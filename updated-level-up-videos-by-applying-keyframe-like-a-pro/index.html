<h3 id="How-To-Combine-Video-With-Two-Audio-Using-FFmpeg"><a href="#How-To-Combine-Video-With-Two-Audio-Using-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="How To Combine Video With Two Audio Using FFmpeg"></a>How To Combine Video With Two Audio Using FFmpeg</h3><p>Are you looking to add multiple audio tracks to your video? With FFmpeg, you can easily combine video with two audio streams. Whether creating a foreign-language version of your video or adding an alternate audio track, this method will help you achieve professional results. This section will guide you through combining video with two audio streams using FFmpeg’s command-line interface. So, let’s get started!</p>
<p><strong>Mixing Two Audios Into a Video</strong></p>
<p>Combining multiple audio tracks into one video can be done easily with FFmpeg’s command-line interface. In this example, we will combine two audio tracks into one video so that the voiceover will play over the background music. Here’s the step-by-step process:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Open</strong> your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your video and audio files are located.</p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Replace</strong> “<strong>video1.mp4</strong>“ and “<strong>audio1.mp3</strong>“ with the names of your actual video and audio files.</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg \</em></p>
<p><em>-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \</em></p>
<p>Step3 The <strong>-c:v copy</strong> flag tells FFmpeg to copy the video stream from the source file without re-encoding it. This helps to speed up the process and avoid quality loss.</p>
<p><em>-c:v copy \</em></p>
<p><em>-filter_complex “ \</em></p>
<p>Step4 The command “<strong>amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest</strong>“ tells amix to accept 2 inputs (<strong>0:a and 1:a</strong>) and <strong>combine</strong> them into an output stream called <strong>audio_out</strong>, with the duration of the longest input.</p>
<p><em>[0:a][1:a] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out] \</em></p>
<p>Step5 <strong>Map</strong> the video stream <strong>(0:v)</strong> and the mixed audio stream <strong>(audio_out)</strong> into the final output video.</p>
<p><em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“ \</em></p>
<p>Step6 The <strong>-y flag</strong> tells FFmpeg to overwrite the output file if it already exists.</p>
<p><em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p>Once complete, you’ll find the newly created video file with the mixed audio in the specified output location.</p>
<p><strong>Mixing Two Audios Into a Video Adjusting Volume</strong></p>
<p>We will be taking a step further and show you how to merge two audio tracks into a video while adjusting the volume of one of the audio tracks. This can be useful when you want to emphasize one audio track over the other, for example, to make the voiceover more prominent in a video.</p>
<p>And here’s the step-by-step process:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Start</strong> the command by specifying the input files.</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg \</em></p>
<p> <em>-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>filter_complex</strong> option to specify a filter graph.</p>
<p> <em>-filter_complex “ \</em></p>
<p> <em>[0:a] volume&#x3D;0.5 [music];</em></p>
<p>Step3 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>amix</strong> filter to take the “<strong>music</strong>“ stream and <strong>audio1.mp3</strong> and <strong>mix</strong> them.</p>
<p> <em>[music][1:a] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out] \</em></p>
<p> <em>“ \</em></p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>map</strong> option to <strong>specify</strong> which streams from the input files should be included in the output file.</p>
<p> <em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“ \</em></p>
<p>Step5 <strong>Specify</strong> the output file name as “<strong>output.mp4</strong>“ and the <strong>-y flag</strong> to overwrite the output file without asking for confirmation if it already exists.</p>
<p> <em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p><strong>Mixing Two Audios Into a Video With Delay</strong></p>
<p>When creating videos, sometimes the audio needs to be synced with the video, or you want to add a delay to the audio track. Here’s how to add delay to an audio track using FFmpeg.</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>adelay filter</strong> to add delay to the audio track.</p>
<p><em>[1:a] adelay&#x3D;2100|2100 [voice];</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Mix</strong> the delayed audio track with the original audio track</p>
<p><em>[0:a][voice] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out]</em></p>
<p>Step3 <strong>Map</strong> the video and audio tracks to the output file</p>
<p><em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“</em></p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>-y flag</strong> to overwrite the output file</p>
<p><em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p>The final command would look like this:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg \</em></p>
<p> <em>-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \</em></p>
<p> <em>-filter_complex “ \</em></p>
<p> <em>[1:a] adelay&#x3D;2100|2100 [voice]; \</em></p>
<p> <em>[0:a][voice] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out] \</em></p>
<p> <em>“ \</em></p>
<p> <em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“ \</em></p>
<p> <em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p>This command will delay the audio track by 2100 milliseconds and then mix it with the original audio track, resulting in a new video file with the delayed audio.</p>

How I Decided to Start from Uploading the Video</h2><p>But before we move forward for more details about the video editor itself, let’s get back first five years ago. It all started when I filmed a certain place during a trip and somebody told me to upload it on YouTube. At first, I was hesitant doing that because I have no clue of what is YouTube. So, I did research and got curious, so I decided to upload the video. Time went by and I started to learn how to vlog.</p>

<li>An intro – what is your channel all about.</li>
<li>The body of the vlog – the part wherein you’re explaining everything in depth, elaborating things about the topic you chose to share. In this part, you can insert the so called <strong>“<strong>call of action</strong>“</strong> - wherein you can tell your viewers to subscribe, to like and comment something about your vlog you’re tackling.

<p>What Have I Encountered on the Way</p>
<p>It’s not easy to become a Youtuber, because you, yourself is the only one that you’ve got. You are the director – managing everything all at once. The artist (youtuber) - the one who’s going to talk in front of the camera. The scriptwriter – the one who’s in charge of the whole story of the video and even the editor- the one who’ll edit the video afterwards.</p>
<p>On YouTube platform, you have to be consistent. It doesn’t mean that you need to upload a video thrice in a week, but even a video will do. After all, it’s quality over quantity. You’ll have to think what kind of video you’ll upload because you need to give your viewers or audiences something significant out of your vlog. YouTube is the second largest search engine next to Google, so most of the people are searching for answers to their questions. Or even searching solutions to their problems. So, if you have something to offer, why not share it for free.</p>
<p>If you’re a new YouTuber, you don’t need to have high-end equipment’s for vlogging. Anyone can start up by using his&#x2F;her mobile phone. I used to vlog using my Samsung S-6. Mobile phone nowadays, can record a high-definition resolution. You can add a tripod so that your phone can be sturdy during your filming session. Just film during day time so that you can minimize yourself from buying a ring light. A lavalier microphone can be a useful add-on so that your viewers or audiences can hear your voice clearly.</p>

What to Do As a YouTuber</h2><p>As a Youtuber, you should find your own niche. Something that you’re passionate about. Something denoting products, services, or interests that appeal to a small, specialized section of the population. Something that you’re a hundred percent that you can deliver to them loud and clear.</p>

<p>What to Do As a YouTuber</p>
<p>As a YouTuber, you should be yourself in front of the camera. At first it will be awkward, but in time you’ll get used to it. Speak with your heart and not with your mind because when you start to think of the things that you need to say, you’ll get distracted. But when you speak whatever is in your heart at that very moment, you can create miracles and wonders.</p>
<p>It’s okay that you stutter once in a while. Even a reporter experiencing that kind of phenomena and besides, no one is perfect. Everything that you said unnecessarily can be omitted during the editing process. During editing, the first thing that you need to do is to put all the raw videos in your video editor’s timeline. Cut all the unnecessary part specially the so called, <strong>“<strong>dead air</strong>“</strong> or the part that you’re starting to think and not to talk at all. And your viewers can only see are all dead silence. After that you can add your personal touch. You can add your watermark (your trademark in other words), lower third green screens, subtitle if necessary (the hardest part to be honest) if you’re doing it manually. Some cool stickers, effects and transitions.</p>
<h2 id="5-How-I-Started-Video-Editing"><a href="#5-How-I-Started-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="5. How I Started Video Editing"></a>5.

There’s Creator Academy wherein you can watch very interesting tutorials that can be a big help in your editing skills in the future.</p>
<p>If we’re going to dig in, there are lots of features that’s a game changer when it comes to editing indeed! Like bunch of Title styles that you can choose from. You can insert green screen videos (that I personally love to use in my vlogs) and there’s a Motion Tracker if you want to focus in an object or person in action. If you’re not in the mood in editing manually, you can make a montage and the software will make it for you in the Auto Montage Maker – the software will choose the highlights of your video and deliver the results after.</p>

<p>It also has new features that I personally not encountered with my previous video editor like Instant Mode and from the word itself, this mode can make your video in a blink of an eye. There’s Creator Academy wherein you can watch very interesting tutorials that can be a big help in your editing skills in the future.</p>
<p>If we’re going to dig in, there are lots of features that’s a game changer when it comes to editing indeed! Like bunch of Title styles that you can choose from. You can insert green screen videos (that I personally love to use in my vlogs) and there’s a Motion Tracker if you want to focus in an object or person in action. If you’re not in the mood in editing manually, you can make a montage and the software will make it for you in the Auto Montage Maker – the software will choose the highlights of your video and deliver the results after.</p>
<p>Key framing is also one of the incredible features of this editor in case that you want to emphasize things in your video. To zoom in&#x2F;out a certain part to be exact.</p>

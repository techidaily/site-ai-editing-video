</li>
<li><p>If you come across anything you like and want to view it again, you may stop the video by pressing the space bar twice. However, pressing the spacebar will cause the playing speed to be reset.</p>

Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.</p>
<h3 id="Updating-Your-Quicktime-to-the-Latest-Version"><a href="#Updating-Your-Quicktime-to-the-Latest-Version" class="headerlink" title="Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version"></a>Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version</h3><p>The user must carefully study the QuickTime player. For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.</p>
<p>People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.</p>
<h3 id="Examine-the-System-and-Driver"><a href="#Examine-the-System-and-Driver" class="headerlink" title="Examine the System and Driver"></a>Examine the System and Driver</h3><p>Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.</p>
<p>To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.</p>
<p>Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.</p>
<p>You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.</p>
<h3 id="Inspect-if-the-File-is-Corrupted-or-not"><a href="#Inspect-if-the-File-is-Corrupted-or-not" class="headerlink" title="Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not"></a>Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not</h3><p>Checking the file to see whether it has been corrupted is a good idea regardless of whether QuickTime and your system are up and running. To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.</p>
<p>Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.</p>
<p>It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we’ll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.</p>

Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.</p>
<h3 id="Updating-Your-Quicktime-to-the-Latest-Version-1"><a href="#Updating-Your-Quicktime-to-the-Latest-Version-1" class="headerlink" title="Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version"></a>Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version</h3><p>The user must carefully study the QuickTime player. For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.</p>
<p>People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.</p>
<h3 id="Examine-the-System-and-Driver-1"><a href="#Examine-the-System-and-Driver-1" class="headerlink" title="Examine the System and Driver"></a>Examine the System and Driver</h3><p>Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.</p>
<p>To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.</p>
<p>Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.</p>
<p>You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.</p>
<h3 id="Inspect-if-the-File-is-Corrupted-or-not-1"><a href="#Inspect-if-the-File-is-Corrupted-or-not-1" class="headerlink" title="Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not"></a>Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not</h3><p>Checking the file to see whether it has been corrupted is a good idea regardless of whether QuickTime and your system are up and running. To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.</p>
<p>Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.</p>
<p>It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we’ll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.</p>

Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.</p>
<h3 id="Updating-Your-Quicktime-to-the-Latest-Version-2"><a href="#Updating-Your-Quicktime-to-the-Latest-Version-2" class="headerlink" title="Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version"></a>Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version</h3><p>The user must carefully study the QuickTime player. For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.</p>
<p>People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.</p>
<h3 id="Examine-the-System-and-Driver-2"><a href="#Examine-the-System-and-Driver-2" class="headerlink" title="Examine the System and Driver"></a>Examine the System and Driver</h3><p>Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.</p>
<p>To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.</p>
<p>Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.</p>
<p>You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.</p>
<h3 id="Inspect-if-the-File-is-Corrupted-or-not-2"><a href="#Inspect-if-the-File-is-Corrupted-or-not-2" class="headerlink" title="Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not"></a>Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not</h3><p>Checking the file to see whether it has been corrupted is a good idea regardless of whether QuickTime and your system are up and running. To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.</p>
<p>Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.</p>
<p>It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we’ll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.</p>

Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.</p>
<h3 id="Updating-Your-Quicktime-to-the-Latest-Version-3"><a href="#Updating-Your-Quicktime-to-the-Latest-Version-3" class="headerlink" title="Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version"></a>Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version</h3><p>The user must carefully study the QuickTime player. For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.</p>
<p>People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.</p>
<h3 id="Examine-the-System-and-Driver-3"><a href="#Examine-the-System-and-Driver-3" class="headerlink" title="Examine the System and Driver"></a>Examine the System and Driver</h3><p>Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.</p>
<p>To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.</p>
<p>Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.</p>
<p>You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.</p>

To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.</p>
<p>Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.</p>
<p>It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we’ll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.</p>

<p><strong>To Cut&#x2F;Trim Videos with Wondershare Filmora:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Drag and Drop the Video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming that you have already downloaded and installed Wondershare Filmora app, click to open. There are two ways through which you can locate your video.</p>
<p>One, you can opt to drag and drop the video from its location to the app’s timeline. Secondly, you can right click on the space at the top left then select the video to be edited from the dialogue box that will appear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-5.png"
                      alt="cut-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Trimming the video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After dropping the video on the timeline, it is likely to take up a lot of space, especially if it is long.</p>
<p>To trim the video from the beginning, place your cursor at the starting point and wait for the pointer to appear. Then move the point forward. To trim from the end, place the cursor at that point, hold and move the pointer forward till the required point.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-6.png"
                      alt="cut-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-7.png"
                      alt="cut-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Trimming the video does not mean that you lose the parts. It is more like shortening it to fit in place.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cutting the video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike trimming, cutting involves getting rid of a section of the video completely. To do so, you need to first of all isolate that section.</p>
<p>With the video on the timeline, move and point your cursor at the starting point of the video and click on the scissors icon at the top. Then move it to the end of the video section and click on the scissors icon again. By so doing, you will have selected that section.</p>
<p>Once the section has been selected, right click on the video, select and click to delete. You can then drag the remaining parts to make them one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="cut-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>After cutting or trimming, you can choose to add several effects to the video. Transitions, watermarks, cropping, resizing, ripple effects among others are some of the changes you could make. All these appear on the menu at the top.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Save and&#x2F;or Import your video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The final step is saving or importing your file to prevent its loss. By clicking on the ‘Import’ button, you save the file to the Media Library. By selecting ‘save as’, you select the location where you want to store your file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<li><strong>Trimming the video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After dropping the video on the timeline, it is likely to take up a lot of space, especially if it is long.</p>
<p>To trim the video from the beginning, place your cursor at the starting point and wait for the pointer to appear. Then move the point forward. To trim from the end, place the cursor at that point, hold and move the pointer forward till the required point.</p>

<p>Trimming the video does not mean that you lose the parts. It is more like shortening it to fit in place.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cutting the video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike trimming, cutting involves getting rid of a section of the video completely. To do so, you need to first of all isolate that section.</p>
<p>With the video on the timeline, move and point your cursor at the starting point of the video and click on the scissors icon at the top. Then move it to the end of the video section and click on the scissors icon again. By so doing, you will have selected that section.</p>
<p>Once the section has been selected, right click on the video, select and click to delete. You can then drag the remaining parts to make them one.</p>

Maybe you don’t need to modify the video because it is already in the correct setting.</p>
<p>So how do you do that in Premiere Pro?</p>
<ol>
<li>Import the video to Adobe Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Check the “Media” window. Next to the video file name is its frame rate. It is written in the format x.00 fps. FPS stands for “frames per second,” which is used interchangeably with the term frame rate.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Reasons-for-Changing-Frame-Rate"><a href="#Reasons-for-Changing-Frame-Rate" class="headerlink" title="Reasons for Changing Frame Rate"></a>Reasons for Changing Frame Rate</h2><p>Suppose you have an action-packed video. It would not look great at 30 fps - it will look too choppy. That will give your audience a rotten viewing experience. By increasing the frames, you can make the motion more fluid and smoother.</p>
<p>Increasing the frames per second also results in better slow-motion videos. A 30 fps one would not look good with this effect because it does not show smooth motion. Thus, we recommend making the video at least 60 fps.</p>
<p>However, a higher frame rate does not always mean better videos. It can result in what they call the “soap opera effect.” It means the video shows too many details. That makes the videos seem “unnatural” or less cinematic.</p>
<p>High frame rates make videos look more realistic since there is less stuttering and motion blur between frames. That’s great. But for older audiences - the ones used to watching videos at 24 fps, it can be off-putting. So it’s also important to consider your target audience when deciding the right frame rate for your video.</p>
<p>With these reasons in mind, you may want to change your video’s frame rate.</p>

Here’s a quick guide on how to change fps in Adobe Premiere Pro. This program gives you two different ways to change fps. One is changing the frame rate of a sequence; the other is changing the frame rate of the video clip. We will teach you how to do both.</p>
<h3 id="l-Change-the-Frame-Rate-of-a-Sequence"><a href="#l-Change-the-Frame-Rate-of-a-Sequence" class="headerlink" title="l Change the Frame Rate of a Sequence"></a>l Change the Frame Rate of a Sequence</h3><p>Suppose you want to keep the frame rate of most of the video the same. Only some parts need adjusting. You can change the frame rate of the sequences that need changing instead. Here are the steps to follow to achieve this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your project in Adobe Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>In the Project panel, select the sequence whose frame rate you want to change. Right-click on that sequence.</li>
<li>Choose “Sequence Settings” from the menu that appears.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Import your video clip to Premiere Pro and drag it to the timeline.</li>
<li>Go to the “Effects” tab. It’s in the options at the bottom left of the screen.</li>

<ol>
<li>Drag and drop the Posterize Time effect to the clip whose frame rate you want to change.</li>
<li>Click “Effect Controls” at the top left of the screen.</li>
<li>Select the small “arrow” button next to the “Frame Rate” text under “Posterize Time.”</li>
<li>Change the frame rate to your preferred setting. For example, type “60” to make the video 60 fps.</li>

If you are a gaming content creator on YouTube, you probably record videos at this frame rate. You’d want to edit that footage and export it at the same frame rate.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to do that. But it’s a little bit of a hidden feature. When creating a sequence, you may notice that the highest the frame rate can go is 60 frames per second. That’s obviously not the number that we want. Don’t worry. There is a workaround. The best thing is that it’s super easy.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to change your video to 120 fps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import your 120 fps video to Adobe Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Select your footage. Drag it to your timeline or the tab where the text says, “Drop media here to create sequence.”</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Select the timeline panel. Click “Sequence” &gt; “Sequence Settings.”</li>
<li>Check the “Timebase” section. It should say “119.88 frames&#x2F;second,” 120 fps when rounded off.</li>

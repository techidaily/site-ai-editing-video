<p>You can create artistic videos that tell various stories and captivate viewers by using Filmora. The following steps describe how to create a double exposure effect in Filmora.</p>
<p>Step1 Download the Filmora application</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="filmora download page"
                ></p>
<p>Before you start editing, click <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bit.ly/3tav2d5" >https://bit.ly/3tav2d5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download the Filmora app. On the page that appears, click the <strong>Free Download</strong> option. Then, the Filmora installer is automatically downloaded. To start installing Filmora, double-click the installer and click <strong>Agree</strong> to agree with the terms and conditions. Then, wait for approximately 2 minutes for the installation to complete.</p>
<p>Step2 Start a new project in Filmora</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-2.jpg"
                      alt="set up a new project"
                ></p>
<p>After a successful installation, the app automatically runs, and you can start editing videos. Click <strong>New Project</strong> to start a project on a clean canvas.</p>
<p>Before starting a new project, we recommend you plan a theme for your videos. You can incorporate different elements into your videos to convey a dramatic, light, or fun theme. This step will help you communicate the mood and message you want to convey to the audience.</p>
<p>Step3 Select a foreground video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-3.jpg"
                      alt="add a base video"
                ></p>
<p>To create a trendy double exposure effect, record a video clip with a white or neutral background. Then, import the specified video to Filmora. In the second layer of the video editing pane, drag the video.</p>
<p>The first video is called the foreground video, which serves as the base video to achieve the desired double exposure effect. It is important to choose neutral or calm colors to make it easier for you to remove the background and highlight the main subject of your video.</p>
<p>Step4 Edit the foreground video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-4.jpg"
                      alt="adjust the color settings of the foreground video"
                ></p>
<p>Edit the foreground video by adjusting the color settings. Click the <strong>Color Correction</strong> icon to open the color settings. In the <strong>Advanced Color Tuning</strong> box that appears, click <strong>Adjust</strong>. In this article, the value of <strong>Exposure</strong> is set to <strong>18,</strong> and <strong>Contrast</strong> is set to <strong>28</strong>. Then, <strong>Vibrance</strong> and <strong>Saturation</strong> are set to <strong>-100</strong>. In the <strong>Light</strong> settings, the values of <strong>Highlights</strong> and <strong>Shadows</strong> are set to <strong>-100</strong>, <strong>Whites</strong> is set to <strong>0</strong>, and <strong>Blacks</strong> is set to <strong>-30</strong>. You can experiment and play with the settings based on the theme that you want to achieve.</p>
<p>Step5 Select a background video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-5.jpg"
                      alt="import a video clip as a background video"
                ></p>
<p>For the background video, select a video clip and import the video to Filmora. Then, drag the video in a layer below the foreground video.</p>
<p>When you select a background video, make sure that the video is vibrant, colorful, and has lots of texture. For example, you can select landscapes, flowers, leaves, textured patterns, city lights, sunsets, or other graphic components. The colors and lighting in the background video significantly impact the final output’s overall appearance.</p>
<p>Step6 Blend the foreground and background videos</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-6.jpg"
                      alt="produce double exposure effect"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to produce a perfect double-exposed video, blending layers is properly essential. To do this, double click the foreground video. Go to the <strong>Compositing</strong> option and set <strong>Blending Mode</strong> to <strong>Lighten</strong>. You can also configure <strong>Blending Mode</strong> based on your preference.</p>
<p>The steps that are outlined in this article can help you apply double exposure effects to your videos. You can modify your videos to your preferences by using all the resources that Filmora provides.</p>
<p>A simple video clip with a double-exposure effect adds a dramatic and dreamy effect to it. The creator can work with colors, exposures, and brightness to achieve a double-exposure effect. This technique provides creative results and allows the video creator to tell a story to the audience in a manner that a plain video clip cannot convey. It is useful, especially when editing personal or professional videos, such as documentaries, wedding videos, travel vlogs, and other artistic works.</p>
<p>Before, the double-exposure effect could only be achieved by using cameras and specialized photographic skills. These days, creators can use Filmora Video Editor to replicate the double-exposure effect in just a few simple steps. Filmora Video Editor is an easy-to-use tool that has helped over 85 million video creators from 150 countries around the world. Videos are compatible with iPhone, iPad, Samsung, Amazon, HTC, PSP, and many more. You can also watch quality videos in AVI, VOB, MP4, WMV, 3GP, MKV, AVI, and more.</p>

The video editor also allows creators to have more creative freedom over their videos and share their outputs on different platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram.</p>

<p>You can create artistic videos that tell various stories and captivate viewers by using Filmora. The following steps describe how to create a double exposure effect in Filmora.</p>
<p>Step1 Download the Filmora application</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="filmora download page"
                ></p>
<p>Before you start editing, click <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bit.ly/3tav2d5" >https://bit.ly/3tav2d5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download the Filmora app. On the page that appears, click the <strong>Free Download</strong> option. Then, the Filmora installer is automatically downloaded. To start installing Filmora, double-click the installer and click <strong>Agree</strong> to agree with the terms and conditions. Then, wait for approximately 2 minutes for the installation to complete.</p>
<p>Step2 Start a new project in Filmora</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-2.jpg"
                      alt="set up a new project"
                ></p>
<p>After a successful installation, the app automatically runs, and you can start editing videos. Click <strong>New Project</strong> to start a project on a clean canvas.</p>
<p>Before starting a new project, we recommend you plan a theme for your videos. You can incorporate different elements into your videos to convey a dramatic, light, or fun theme. This step will help you communicate the mood and message you want to convey to the audience.</p>
<p>Step3 Select a foreground video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add a base video"
                ></p>
<p>To create a trendy double exposure effect, record a video clip with a white or neutral background. Then, import the specified video to Filmora. In the second layer of the video editing pane, drag the video.</p>
<p>The first video is called the foreground video, which serves as the base video to achieve the desired double exposure effect. It is important to choose neutral or calm colors to make it easier for you to remove the background and highlight the main subject of your video.</p>
<p>Step4 Edit the foreground video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the color settings of the foreground video"
                ></p>
<p>Edit the foreground video by adjusting the color settings. Click the <strong>Color Correction</strong> icon to open the color settings. In the <strong>Advanced Color Tuning</strong> box that appears, click <strong>Adjust</strong>. In this article, the value of <strong>Exposure</strong> is set to <strong>18,</strong> and <strong>Contrast</strong> is set to <strong>28</strong>. Then, <strong>Vibrance</strong> and <strong>Saturation</strong> are set to <strong>-100</strong>. In the <strong>Light</strong> settings, the values of <strong>Highlights</strong> and <strong>Shadows</strong> are set to <strong>-100</strong>, <strong>Whites</strong> is set to <strong>0</strong>, and <strong>Blacks</strong> is set to <strong>-30</strong>. You can experiment and play with the settings based on the theme that you want to achieve.</p>
<p>Step5 Select a background video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import a video clip as a background video"
                ></p>
<p>For the background video, select a video clip and import the video to Filmora. Then, drag the video in a layer below the foreground video.</p>

The advantages are likewise limited to a single user.</p>
<p>Server boosts are one of Discord’s main revenue streams, and they function similarly to Nitro. There are, nevertheless, significant distinctions. Server boosts are benefits tied to a particular server and used by any member.</p>
<p>A server must acquire two boosts to unlock level 1 boosts, seven boosts to reach level 2 perks and fourteen boosts for level 3.</p>
<p>With all of this in mind, can you say, <strong>Discord server boosts</strong> are worthwhile? They most certainly are. The added features can improve everyone’s server experience and are inexpensive, significantly if boosting as a group.</p>
<p>Whether or not server boosting is worthwhile is mainly subjective. If you’re not an active server member and only use Discord to play games with a small group of pals, you might want to save your money. if you’re a member of a clan or online community dedicated to a server, boosting can be a terrific way to contribute to ‘the greater good.’ Aside from the cosmetic bonuses that come with each level, the better audio quality, streaming quality, and upload limit are valuable features.</p>
<p>If you plan to buy two or more <strong>server boosts,</strong> we offer Discord Nitro, which includes two server enhancements for the same price as buying them separately, plus a 30% discount on any additional server boosts purchased.</p>

<p>Level 2 would cost $34.93, and Level 3 would cost $69.86. Nitro subscribers will pay $24.45 for Level 2 and $48.90 for Level 3.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Open the Discord server</p>
<p>Log into your Discord server</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Choose the server you want to boost.</p>
<p>First, choose the server you wish to boost. Go to the Server Settings drop-down menu and select the Server Boost option once you’re on that server.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Verify Benefits and Boost</p>
<p>A new screen will appear after you select the Boost button. This shows the current perks and the number of Server Boosts applied to this server.</p>
<p>If everything appears to be in order, click the Boost This Server button to confirm it.</p>
<p>Remember that you can also “Gift Nitro” to someone else from this screen. You can give more if you’re feeling generous.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Confirmation Page</p>
<p>Discord wants to make sure you understand what you’re signing up for, so you’ll be asked to reconfirm.</p>
<p>They’ll ask you again when you hit the confirmation button. If you have second thoughts, this is your time to back out.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Discord is aware that you’re serious about enhancing a server’s performance. They want to make sure you’re boosting the correct one. If everything looks good, push the Boost button one more time.</p>
<p>However, you should be aware that if you boost this Server, you will be unable to transfer this Boost to another server for seven days.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Choose a Boost Number</p>
<p>Do you require several boosts?</p>
<p>This action can be after the confirmation screen.</p>
<p>Choose how many boosts you want for this Server in Discord. But don’t be concerned! Before you pay for anything, you can see the subtotal.</p>

<p>Thanks to increased uptake by the coronavirus epidemic, Discord has become more prevalent than ever in recent years. However, while many individuals have become more familiar with Discord, not everyone is aware of all its features. <strong>Discord server boost</strong> can help you unlock Discord’s full potential by adding new features to the server you run.</p>
<p>A <strong>server boost</strong> might provide various benefits. These increases, however, are not free, which is why it’s necessary to debate if they’re worthwhile.</p>

The advantages are likewise limited to a single user.</p>
<p>Server boosts are one of Discord’s main revenue streams, and they function similarly to Nitro. There are, nevertheless, significant distinctions. Server boosts are benefits tied to a particular server and used by any member.</p>
<p>A server must acquire two boosts to unlock level 1 boosts, seven boosts to reach level 2 perks and fourteen boosts for level 3.</p>
<p>With all of this in mind, can you say, <strong>Discord server boosts</strong> are worthwhile? They most certainly are. The added features can improve everyone’s server experience and are inexpensive, significantly if boosting as a group.</p>
<p>Whether or not server boosting is worthwhile is mainly subjective. If you’re not an active server member and only use Discord to play games with a small group of pals, you might want to save your money. if you’re a member of a clan or online community dedicated to a server, boosting can be a terrific way to contribute to ‘the greater good.’ Aside from the cosmetic bonuses that come with each level, the better audio quality, streaming quality, and upload limit are valuable features.</p>
<p>If you plan to buy two or more <strong>server boosts,</strong> we offer Discord Nitro, which includes two server enhancements for the same price as buying them separately, plus a 30% discount on any additional server boosts purchased.</p>

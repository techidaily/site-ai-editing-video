Typically, this occurs because a motion blur effect was not used while editing. Learning the ins, outs, rights, and wrongs of Motion Blur in After Effects is one of the most thrilling early steps in the motion graphics adventure. Learning how and when to utilize it successfully is a true “level up” moment for most designers.</p>

Adding motion blur After Effects Is a fantastic tool for making items mix more naturally in your compositions. Let’s quickly examine Motion Blur with all of this in mind. To help you better grasp motion blur and how to add motion blur to flawlessly merge objects in your video projects or even create styled effects, we’ve put up a detailed guide here.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Motion-Blur-Effects"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Motion-Blur-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Motion Blur Effects"></a>Part 1. What is Motion Blur Effects</h2><p>Let’s start with a little introduction before learning how to apply motion blur. The visual result of an item moving while being photographed in conjunction with the shutter speed of the camera is called motion blur. When we swiftly move our heads from side to side, this effect also naturally occurs with our eyes, but we aren’t aware of it since our brains “edit” it for us. It may be startling and awkward to watch when items are moving on the screen, particularly rapid motion, without any kind of blurring effect.</p>
<p>Motion blur was introduced into animation to aid in the blending of frames and replicate the blurring that was seen in earlier cameras as a result of fast-moving objects. When a moving item keeps moving while light is still reaching our eyes, motion blur results. The goal of Motion Blur in After Effects is to replicate this phenomenon. After Effects will duplicate your layer several times when it changes in size or location. Then, it will offset it in various ways. This is closely related to the direction and pace of your layer’s animation.</p>
<p>These days, we have cameras with fast shutter speeds, which allows us to almost completely remove motion blur. Without motion blurring, each frame of your animation is like a flawless still image, making the action seem a little disorienting. Each picture captures the exact moment in time, despite the fluid motion. However, the absence of motion blur is what viewers do notice. Because of this, visual effects creators often use artificial motion blur in their effects to replicate what the viewer would experience if the element were really there in the picture.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-Motion-Blur-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-Motion-Blur-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Add Motion Blur in After Effects"></a>Part 2. How to Add Motion Blur in After Effects</h2><p>In videos, slow-motion may be used in a variety of ways, such as to convey the emotional context of a story or make beautiful slideshow backdrops. It doesn’t matter why you want to make a slow-motion sequence; After Effects’ slow-motion effect will work well. Click the Motion Blur layer switch to turn Motion Blur on or off. Make sure you can render out Motion Blur by turning on the Enable Motion Blur composition option at the top of the Timeline panel.</p>
<p>Using the motion blur option in your layer settings is the first and easiest approach to apply motion blur in After Effects. You’ll see many choices on the left and right sides of the screen after choosing a certain video. There are several techniques to motion blur a video, which we wish to accomplish. But because this guide is for novices, we will choose the simpler option. Follow the steps below to learn how to add motion blur to a video in AE:</p>
<p><strong>Steps to Add Motion Blur to After Effects:</strong></p>
<p>So, it goes without saying that After Effects makes it simple to access Motion Blur’s magic. You should shoot the movie at a frame rate that is faster than the average if you want the greatest slow-motion effects. How many photos are being captured each second is indicated by the frame rate.</p>
<p>Step1 Download and install Adobe After Effects if it isn’t already on your PC. Since Adobe After Effects is a commercial program, it is not available for free. Open the program after installation. After installation, launch it and choose “New Project” to begin editing a brand-new file. Look through the video you wish to alter.</p>

<p>Step2 You have a variety of settings in Adobe After Effects on the right side. Then, choose “Effects &amp; Presets.” A search bar will appear as a result. Enter “CC Force Motion Blur” in the search field if you wish to add motion blur to the video. You may apply this effect to whatever layer you choose since your movie is made up of layers.</p>

## Part 1\. What is Motion Blur Effects

<p>Let’s start with a little introduction before learning how to apply motion blur. The visual result of an item moving while being photographed in conjunction with the shutter speed of the camera is called motion blur. When we swiftly move our heads from side to side, this effect also naturally occurs with our eyes, but we aren’t aware of it since our brains “edit” it for us. It may be startling and awkward to watch when items are moving on the screen, particularly rapid motion, without any kind of blurring effect.</p>
<p>Motion blur was introduced into animation to aid in the blending of frames and replicate the blurring that was seen in earlier cameras as a result of fast-moving objects. When a moving item keeps moving while light is still reaching our eyes, motion blur results. The goal of Motion Blur in After Effects is to replicate this phenomenon. After Effects will duplicate your layer several times when it changes in size or location. Then, it will offset it in various ways. This is closely related to the direction and pace of your layer’s animation.</p>
<p>These days, we have cameras with fast shutter speeds, which allows us to almost completely remove motion blur. Without motion blurring, each frame of your animation is like a flawless still image, making the action seem a little disorienting. Each picture captures the exact moment in time, despite the fluid motion. However, the absence of motion blur is what viewers do notice. Because of this, visual effects creators often use artificial motion blur in their effects to replicate what the viewer would experience if the element were really there in the picture.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-Motion-Blur-in-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-Motion-Blur-in-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Add Motion Blur in After Effects"></a>Part 2. How to Add Motion Blur in After Effects</h2><p>In videos, slow-motion may be used in a variety of ways, such as to convey the emotional context of a story or make beautiful slideshow backdrops. It doesn’t matter why you want to make a slow-motion sequence; After Effects’ slow-motion effect will work well. Click the Motion Blur layer switch to turn Motion Blur on or off. Make sure you can render out Motion Blur by turning on the Enable Motion Blur composition option at the top of the Timeline panel.</p>
<p>Using the motion blur option in your layer settings is the first and easiest approach to apply motion blur in After Effects. You’ll see many choices on the left and right sides of the screen after choosing a certain video. There are several techniques to motion blur a video, which we wish to accomplish. But because this guide is for novices, we will choose the simpler option. Follow the steps below to learn how to add motion blur to a video in AE:</p>
<p><strong>Steps to Add Motion Blur to After Effects:</strong></p>
<p>So, it goes without saying that After Effects makes it simple to access Motion Blur’s magic. You should shoot the movie at a frame rate that is faster than the average if you want the greatest slow-motion effects. How many photos are being captured each second is indicated by the frame rate.</p>
<p>Step1 Download and install Adobe After Effects if it isn’t already on your PC. Since Adobe After Effects is a commercial program, it is not available for free. Open the program after installation. After installation, launch it and choose “New Project” to begin editing a brand-new file. Look through the video you wish to alter.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step2 You have a variety of settings in Adobe After Effects on the right side. Then, choose “Effects &amp; Presets.” A search bar will appear as a result. Enter “CC Force Motion Blur” in the search field if you wish to add motion blur to the video. You may apply this effect to whatever layer you choose since your movie is made up of layers.</p>

This feature helps create slow-motion videos by slowing down the recorded action when played at normal speed. These <strong>slow-motion</strong> <strong>cameras</strong> are popular in filmmaking, sports analysis, science, and content creation. That’s because they capture detailed moments and highlight fast-moving things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Frame Rate:</strong> Regular videos usually record 24, 30, or 60 frames per second (fps). But <strong>slow-motion cameras</strong> can capture hundreds or thousands of frames per second. More frames mean more details and smoother slow-motion videos when played back.</li>
<li><strong>Smooth Playback:</strong> Slow-motion videos look smooth and purposeful when played at regular speeds. More frames are recorded initially to achieve this effect. Ultimately, it will preserve all details when the video is played in slow motion.</li>
<li><strong>High-Resolution Sensors:</strong> Lots of <strong>slow-motion cameras</strong> have high-quality sensors. These sensors ensure that even with more frames captured, the picture stays sharp and detailed in slow-motion videos. This helps capture fine details without losing clarity.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Control:</strong> <strong>Slow-motion cameras</strong> let filmmakers and videographers control how fast or slow some parts of a scene look. This helps tell stories better, focus on details, and make videos more interesting and attractive to watch.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Motion Blur:</strong> More frames per second make pictures clearer and sharper. This feature works especially for fast-moving things. This is important when you need to see tiny details or when the lighting isn’t great.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Resolution: Slow-motion cameras</strong> can record lots of details in quick movements. They’re handy in sports, science, and creative videos where catching fast and detailed actions matter a lot.</li>

This feature helps create slow-motion videos by slowing down the recorded action when played at normal speed. These <strong>slow-motion</strong> <strong>cameras</strong> are popular in filmmaking, sports analysis, science, and content creation. That’s because they capture detailed moments and highlight fast-moving things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Frame Rate:</strong> Regular videos usually record 24, 30, or 60 frames per second (fps). But <strong>slow-motion cameras</strong> can capture hundreds or thousands of frames per second. More frames mean more details and smoother slow-motion videos when played back.</li>
<li><strong>Smooth Playback:</strong> Slow-motion videos look smooth and purposeful when played at regular speeds. More frames are recorded initially to achieve this effect. Ultimately, it will preserve all details when the video is played in slow motion.</li>
<li><strong>High-Resolution Sensors:</strong> Lots of <strong>slow-motion cameras</strong> have high-quality sensors. These sensors ensure that even with more frames captured, the picture stays sharp and detailed in slow-motion videos. This helps capture fine details without losing clarity.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Control:</strong> <strong>Slow-motion cameras</strong> let filmmakers and videographers control how fast or slow some parts of a scene look. This helps tell stories better, focus on details, and make videos more interesting and attractive to watch.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Motion Blur:</strong> More frames per second make pictures clearer and sharper. This feature works especially for fast-moving things. This is important when you need to see tiny details or when the lighting isn’t great.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Resolution: Slow-motion cameras</strong> can record lots of details in quick movements. They’re handy in sports, science, and creative videos where catching fast and detailed actions matter a lot.</li>

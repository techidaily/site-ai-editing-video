<h3 id="Advantages-of-TS-File-Format"><a href="#Advantages-of-TS-File-Format" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of TS File Format"></a>Advantages of TS File Format</h3><p>A great thing about TS format is that, after each keyframe, the file information is added automatically.

You can easily share large files over the communication media in real-time as tiny chunks of the audio or video file are sent.

MP4: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:</p>
<h3 id="TS"><a href="#TS" class="headerlink" title="TS"></a>TS</h3><p>TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.</p>
<h3 id="MP4"><a href="#MP4" class="headerlink" title="MP4"></a>MP4</h3><p>MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the ‘.ts’ extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.</p>

MP4: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:</p>
<h3 id="TS-2"><a href="#TS-2" class="headerlink" title="TS"></a>TS</h3><p>TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.</p>
<h3 id="MP4-2"><a href="#MP4-2" class="headerlink" title="MP4"></a>MP4</h3><p>MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the ‘.ts’ extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.</p>
<h3 id="Bottom-Line-2"><a href="#Bottom-Line-2" class="headerlink" title="Bottom Line"></a>Bottom Line</h3><p>The article has shared great details about the TS format.

What Is TS Video Format?</h2><p>A TS format file is a Video Transport Stream file. The TS file extension is used to store video data, mostly on DVDs. The video files are standardly compressed with .MPEG video compression. If you are looking for a file extension to save streamed or broadcast videos, TS video format is ideal for this. Are you worried about how to play a TS file?</p>

Pros and Coins about TS Video Format</h2><p>Everything has its beneficial factors and disadvantages, so does TS video format has. Are you ready to know more about the TS file format? After learning about the format, it’s time to share its advantages and drawbacks with you. Let’s get started!</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-of-TS-File-Format-3"><a href="#Advantages-of-TS-File-Format-3" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of TS File Format"></a>Advantages of TS File Format</h3><p>A great thing about TS format is that, after each keyframe, the file information is added automatically. The format is impressive when it comes to maintaining transmission integrity. This is because of all the elementary streams, synchronization patterns, and error corrections; everything is encapsulated in a container format.</p>
<p>Do you know what else benefits TS format has? It is widely used for broadcasting because broadcasting doesn’t need the complete stream for playing it. You can easily share large files over the communication media in real-time as tiny chunks of the audio or video file are sent. Along with this, the error is easily detected as extra information is shared with every chunk, helping in error detection.</p>
<h3 id="Drawbacks-of-TS-File-Format-3"><a href="#Drawbacks-of-TS-File-Format-3" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks of TS File Format"></a>Drawbacks of TS File Format</h3><p>Moving on to its disadvantages, let’s start with the device compatibility. The biggest drawback of using the TS file format is that it is not compatible with many devices. For instance, a built-in media player like Windows Media Player does not support the format; eventually, users must change the file format.</p>
<p>Do you know another significant disadvantage? You cannot share TS files online. Different platforms like Facebook, YouTube, etc., support other famous formats, so hence, sharing TS video files requires a format converter. Do you know how much space does a TS file occupies? Well, it acquires a significant storage space, more than other file formats.</p>

MP4: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:</p>
<h3 id="TS-3"><a href="#TS-3" class="headerlink" title="TS"></a>TS</h3><p>TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.</p>
<h3 id="MP4-3"><a href="#MP4-3" class="headerlink" title="MP4"></a>MP4</h3><p>MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the ‘.ts’ extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.</p>

                      alt="default title filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3</p>
<p>Now, double-click on the Default Title clip. Here, change its font to any bold font. Increase the text size to 120. Type in your text in the box. Scroll a bit down and change the <strong>Text Spacing</strong> to <strong>8.</strong> Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>

                      alt="take snapshot filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5</p>
<p>Double-click on the Default Title clip once again. This time, click on its <strong>Advanced</strong> settings. Here, turn OFF <strong>Text Fill →</strong> turn ON <strong>Outline →</strong> change the Outline color to <strong>White →</strong> reduce <strong>Thickness</strong> to <strong>1.</strong> Click <strong>OK.</strong> Now, take another Snapshot.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/default.png"
                      alt="default title filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3</p>
<p>Now, double-click on the Default Title clip. Here, change its font to any bold font. Increase the text size to 120. Type in your text in the box. Scroll a bit down and change the <strong>Text Spacing</strong> to <strong>8.</strong> Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>

                      alt="edit text"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4</p>
<p>Take a Snapshot of this Default Title.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/snapshot.png"
                      alt="take snapshot filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5</p>
<p>Double-click on the Default Title clip once again. This time, click on its <strong>Advanced</strong> settings. Here, turn OFF <strong>Text Fill →</strong> turn ON <strong>Outline →</strong> change the Outline color to <strong>White →</strong> reduce <strong>Thickness</strong> to <strong>1.</strong> Click <strong>OK.</strong> Now, take another Snapshot.</p>

                      alt="advanced title settings"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6</p>
<p>Delete the Default Title clip from the Timeline. Now, drag the Outline snapshot that we just created to the Timeline. Open the <strong>Crop</strong> tool <strong>→</strong> change the Ratio to <strong>Custom</strong> <strong>→</strong> replace “<strong>1080</strong>” with “<strong>540</strong>”. Lastly, move the highlighted crop section to the top. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>

                      alt="y axis value"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8</p>
<p>Next, click on the <strong>Crop</strong> tool again and simply move the highlighted crop section to the bottom part of the screen. Click <strong>OK.</strong> Then, double-click on the snapshot clip in the Timeline and change the value of the <strong>Y-axis</strong> from “275” to “<strong>-275</strong>”**.** Click <strong>OK.</strong> Take a Snapshot again.</p>
<p>Step 9</p>
<p>Import a background image to <strong>My Media.</strong> Drag the background image to the Timeline. Double-click on it and drag the <strong>Scale</strong> bar until the background image covers the whole screen. Click <strong>OK.</strong> You should cut the background clip to make it 3 seconds long as well.</p>

<p>Step 22</p>
<p>Move the Playhead to 1 minute and 16 seconds. Split the clip and delete the part on the right side. Hide Track 4, 5, and 6. Then, take a Snapshot. Drag this Snapshot next to the clip on Track 3. Place the Playhead on 1 minute and 18 seconds. Then, unhide Track 4, 5, and 6.</p>
<p>Step 23</p>
<p>Double-click on the clip on the right side of Track 3. Add a keyframe by pressing <strong>“+Add”.</strong> Move the Playhead to 1 minute and 23 seconds. Now, resize the clip back to its original size by moving the rectangle left and right. Right now, it should look like this.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 24</p>
<p>Move the Playhead 5 frames forward. Drag the <strong>Y-axis value</strong> to the left until the screen looks like this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="move clip downward"
                ></p>
<p>Step 25</p>
<p>Move the Playhead 5 frames forward again. Drag the value of the <strong>Y-axis</strong> to the left until the screen looks like this. Then, change the <strong>Opacity</strong> to <strong>0%.</strong> Finally, split the clip at 2 minutes and 10 seconds. Delete the part on the right side. Lock Track 3.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="move outline down"
                ></p>
<p>Step 26</p>
<p>Next, drag the Downward Snapshot on Track 2 and follow the same process as in <strong>Steps 19 through 25.</strong></p>
<p>Step 27</p>
<p>Unhide the Background clip at the bottom of the Timeline. Then, Unlock Track 6. Split the clip on Track 6 at the 15th frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="split clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step 28</p>
<p>Move the Playhead at the beginning of the Timeline. Click on the first part of the clip on Track 6. Add a keyframe. Drag the <strong>X-axis</strong> value to the right until the word disappears out of the screen. Like this. 👇Then, move the Playhead to the 6th frame and <strong>Reset</strong> the X-axis value to <strong>0.0.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drag word out of screen"
                ></p>
<p>Step 29</p>
<p>Take the Playhead to 2 minutes and 10 seconds. Split it. Now, move the Playhead to 2 minutes and 19 seconds and add a keyframe. Lastly, take the Playhead to the very end of the clip and drag the text to the right side until it’s out of the screen once again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drag text out of screen"
                ></p>
<p>Step 30</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Effects</strong> tab. Select <strong>Glitch</strong> from the panel on the left. Then, apply <strong>“Glitch Dispersion”</strong> and <strong>“Glitch Stripe 2”</strong> to the clips at the start and at the end.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>

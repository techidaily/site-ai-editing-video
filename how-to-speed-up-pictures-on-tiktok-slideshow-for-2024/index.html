<h2 id="How-to-Make-Subtitle-Videos"><a href="#How-to-Make-Subtitle-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Subtitle Videos"></a>How to Make Subtitle Videos</h2><p>Subtitles are very common for people who watch videos very often. It is simply the text or dialogue usually displayed at the base of the screen of a video. We often use subtitles to watch movies or television programs, play video games, etc. The subtitle makes all the difference when you are watching a video in a language different from the one you know and understand.</p>
<p>A lot of videos will be really difficult to watch when there is no knowledge of the language which the producers used in creating the video. That is where the need for subtitles is seen. It breaks language barriers to publicity of a video i.e it tries to bridge that gap of understanding that exists when you watch a video. It also assists in as little as helping you understand a video that is recorded in a language you speak but in a different accent. An American might find it a bit difficult to understand the accent used in a British movie. So basically, what subtitles do is make understanding better and easier.</p>
<h2 id="1-Types-of-Subtitle-Videos"><a href="#1-Types-of-Subtitle-Videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Types of Subtitle Videos"></a>1. Types of Subtitle Videos</h2><p>There are two (2) broad types of subtitling</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Subtitles</li>
<li>Closed subtitles</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Open Subtitles</strong></p>
<p>Open subtitles are subtitles that are included and incorporated as part of the original video and cannot be removed from the screen. No additional program or tool is required before they are activated and ready for use. Also, no additional tool is needed to edit or remove it. This is because they are part and parcel of the original video and cannot be edited. They are rooted in the original video as part of it and not just as an extension. An example of where it is used is karaoke. These subtitles cannot be switched on and off by the user.</p>
<p><strong>Close Subtitles</strong></p>
<p>Closed subtitles are more malleable than open subtitles. It is relatively easier to add or remove when compared to the open subtitles. They are substantially separate from the original video. They are usually encoded in the transmission signal of the cable or satellite technology and sent separately from the original broadcast, in this case, video. This makes it possible to remove it from the video. They are mostly found on DVDs.</p>
<p>Other classifications sometimes include a third known as soft subtitles. They usually need player support to work effectively. They are the easiest to use because of the flexibility in adding and editing.</p>
<h2 id="2-Subtitle-Formats"><a href="#2-Subtitle-Formats" class="headerlink" title="2. Subtitle Formats"></a>2. Subtitle Formats</h2><p>Subtitle formats are often represented funnily. You see extensions like .srt, .sub, .stl, .mtv, etc. They are the extensions of different subtitle formats. Let’s talk about some of them.</p>
<p><strong>SubRip:</strong> This is one of the most common formats for subtitles. Its extension is ‘.srt’ and they are also the most widely used by modern video subtitling technology. It is stored sequentially along a line with its basic timing and in a human-readable format.</p>
<p><strong>SubViewer:</strong> The sub viewer format is another popular subtitle format. It stores information about periods with tag information. Its extension is ‘.sub’.</p>
<p><strong>Micro DVD:</strong> This subtitle format is compatible with digital videos. They equally carry the ‘. sub’ extension.</p>
<p><strong>Spruce subtitle format:</strong> They usually operate in sequential periods and frames. They have the ‘.stl’ format.</p>
<h2 id="3-What-Are-Subtitles-Used-For"><a href="#3-What-Are-Subtitles-Used-For" class="headerlink" title="3. What Are Subtitles Used For?"></a>3. What Are Subtitles Used For?</h2><p>Now that we’ve known what subtitles are and the various formats they exist in, let’s take a deeper dive into what they’re used for.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing:</strong></p>
<p>You’re probably wondering what marketing is doing at the top of this list. If you work in a multi-national company which branches in different countries and continents, you will find subtitles very helpful in promotional videos for your company. On the other hand, you may not work in a multi-national company but have your business in a multi-ethnic country like Nigeria, New Guinea, Chad, etc. instead of creating videos in all the languages which apply to the people you hope to reach, you can produce one video, add subtitles for the various languages and save cost.</p>
<p><strong>Education:</strong></p>
<p>Educational videos can be produced alongside subtitles in various languages to aid learning, especially for campuses that attract foreign students who might have little to no knowledge of how to speak the language of the school.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding better deaf people:</strong></p>
<p>Subtitle for Deaf or hard-of-hearing (SDH) was introduced by the movie industry specifically made for people with hearing deficiencies. This allows them access to information they would normally be unable to hear or listen to.</p>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong></p>
<p>As already mentioned earlier, some videos are produced in languages other than the ones we understand. Subtitles help to understand what is being said in the video irrespective of the language in which it was originally produced.</p>
<p><strong>Low-quality speakers:</strong></p>
<p>Watching a video with low quality or faulty speakers can be a bit frustrating without subtitles.</p>
<p><strong>Watching videos in a noisy environment:</strong></p>
<p>We have all been in places that are noisy and we have had the need to watch a video or listen to an audio file. Subtitles come in handy at this point. They are also useful when we do not want to distract others while watching a video.</p>
<p><strong>Learn foreign languages:</strong></p>
<p>Subtitles are a very good way to learn new languages, sometimes consciously, other times it happens with any conscious effort. While watching a movie discovered ‘<em>Lo Siento’</em> means I’m sorry in Spanish while ‘_Arigatou_’ means ‘thank you in Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>Reading speed:</strong></p>
<p>If you want to improve your reading speed, subtitles equally help you do that.</p>
<h2 id="4-Subtitle-Tips-and-Tricks"><a href="#4-Subtitle-Tips-and-Tricks" class="headerlink" title="4. Subtitle Tips and Tricks"></a>4. Subtitle Tips and Tricks</h2><p>Subtitle software applications let you add captions to videos, edit them, translate them to languages of your choice, etc. Let us look at a few of them below:</p>
<p><strong>Subtitle Edit:</strong></p>
<p>Subtitle Edit is largely free software that allows users to create timecoded subtitles. Users can also import and convert subtitles from one format to another format. If you’re new to subtitling, this is a good place to start before moving up to other advanced software applications.</p>
<p><strong>Annotation Edit:</strong></p>
<p>Annotation Edit is another application but it is specific to mac users. It has a very good user-friendly interface which makes it easy software to use.</p>
<p>Other software applications are equally very useful in subtitling.</p>
<p>When creating subtitles, ensure they are automated so as not to make it difficult to read when certain colors are displayed on the screen. Timing is very important. Make sure the subtitle is properly synchronized with the actual sound being produced.</p>
<p>Use a user-friendly font style. Each font style is unique for each viewing and it speaks volumes of what the video has to say or the message it wants to pass. So, it is expedient to learn more about font style, font color, font size etc. for a better-subtitled video.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Subtitled videos are more likely to be used than videos without subtitles. So as a content creator, entrepreneur or in any field where you work with videos, adding a subtitle to your videos could be the turning point even for your organization for a wider audience.</p>

<p>It’s crucial to ensure that all encoding-related properties align with your chosen method. This includes the timebase, height and width, codecs, and pixel format. Some methods require the videos you’re merging to have the same encoding, while others allow for different encodings. It’s essential to keep this in mind to ensure that the final video is seamless without any breaks. Remember that these prerequisites will help you have a smooth process.</p>
<h3 id="Concatenate-Videos-With-Same-Codecs-Using-FFmpeg"><a href="#Concatenate-Videos-With-Same-Codecs-Using-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Concatenate Videos With Same Codecs Using FFmpeg"></a>Concatenate Videos With Same Codecs Using FFmpeg</h3><p>If the videos you want to concatenate have the same codec, you can use the FFmpeg “concat” demuxer or protocol to join them together. This simple and efficient method doesn’t require re-encoding the videos, saving time and preserving the original quality. This section will review the steps to concatenate videos using the “concat” demuxer and “concat” protocols in FFmpeg.</p>
<p><strong>Merge Videos With the “Concat” Demuxer</strong></p>
<p>The concat demuxer in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files with the same codecs by reading a list of file paths from a text file and demuxing them in sequence. Each video starts where the previous one finishes without needing to re-encode the videos. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Create</strong> a <strong>.txt file and list</strong> the paths of the video files you want to merge.</p>
<p><em>Join_video.txt</em></p>
<p><em>file &#x2F;Users&#x2F;Video&#x2F;input1.mp4</em></p>
<p><em>file &#x2F;Users&#x2F;Video&#x2F;input2.mp4</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can add more than two video files.</p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Run</strong> the FFmpeg command:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i join_video.txt -c copy output_demuxer.mp4</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note: <em>-safe 0</em></strong> is added to accept any file name.</p>
<p><strong><em>-c copy</em></strong> will copy all the streams.</p>
<p>As this method allows you to “stream copy” the files instead of re-encoding them, the concatenation is very fast. This can be a good option if you have videos with the same codecs and want to join them quickly without losing quality.</p>
<p><strong>Join Videos With the “Concat” Protocol</strong></p>
<p>The concat protocol in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files in a specific format that supports file-level concatenation, such as MPEG-2 TS. However, it cannot be used for other video formats like MP4 and WEBM.</p>
<p>Here’s how to use the “concat protocol:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Run</strong> the FFmpeg command:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg -i “concat:input1.ts|input2.ts” -c copy output_protocol.ts</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The concat protocol allows you to “stream copy” the files by adding the option <strong><em>-c copy</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Input</strong> the file name of the video using this code:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg -i “concat:input1.mp4|input2.mp4” -c copy output_protocol.mp4</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you try to use this method on video formats that are not supported, only the first input video will be saved in the output video. And the video ends after the first video.</p>
<p>Although this method is limited in terms of supported video formats, it’s very easy to use if you merge videos in the supported formats. It’s a single command in the terminal without needing a text file. Additionally, using the -c copy option makes it efficient as it doesn’t require re-encoding, saving time.</p>

However, this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take longer and may result in a loss of quality. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with different codecs or resolutions using FFmpeg.</p>
<p>Here’s how to do it:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Provide</strong> the names of the input files to FFmpeg.</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -i file2.mp4 -i file3.mp4 \</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>filter_complex</strong> filtergraph parameter to instruct FFmpeg from where to take the audio and video.</p>
<p><em>-filter_complex “[0:v] [0:a] [1:v] [1:a] [2:v] [2:a]</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note: [0:v][0:a]</strong> means FFmpeg needs to take the video and audio from the 0th video (file1.mp4).</p>
<p>Step3 Tell FFmpeg to concatenate three files (n&#x3D;3).</p>
<p><em>concat&#x3D;n&#x3D;3:v&#x3D;1:a&#x3D;1 [vv] [aa]“ \</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>v&#x3D;1:a&#x3D;1</strong> implies one stream for the audio and one stream for the video.</p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Map</strong> these audio and video outputs to the final video container. This is done as follows:</p>
<p><em>-map “[vv]“ -map “[aa]“ mergedVideo.mp4</em></p>
<p>It is important to note that this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take more time and may result in a loss of quality. However, it offers the flexibility of filtering the videos before concatenating them. The filter_complex method in FFmpeg allows you to concatenate videos of different codecs and resolutions. The final step is to map the audio and video outputs to the final video container. This can be done using the -map command.</p>

We’ll be using the filter_complex method in FFmpeg, which allows you to manipulate and concatenate multiple audio and video streams in a single command. This method is more advanced but allows you to join videos with different audio streams and create a final video with multiple audio tracks.</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Specify</strong> the input files and opening.mkv, episode.mkv, and ending.mkv:</p>
<p><em>$ ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter_complex</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>filter_complex</strong> parameter in FFmpeg to specify the input streams for the video and audio.</p>

<p><strong>Dual audio streams</strong> ([0:1][0:2], [1:1][1:2], [2:1][2:2])</p>
<p>Step3 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>concat</strong> filter to specify that you want to concatenate 3 files (n&#x3D;3) with 1 video stream (v&#x3D;1) and 2 audio streams (a&#x3D;2). Specify the output streams as [v], [a1], [a2]:</p>
<p><em>concat&#x3D;n&#x3D;3:v&#x3D;1:a&#x3D;2 [v] [a1] [a2]</em></p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>-map</strong> option to map the output streams to the final video container:</p>

<p><strong>Join Videos With the “Concat” Protocol</strong></p>
<p>The concat protocol in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files in a specific format that supports file-level concatenation, such as MPEG-2 TS. However, it cannot be used for other video formats like MP4 and WEBM.</p>
<p>Here’s how to use the “concat protocol:</p>

But you cannot take their promises for granted. Instead, evaluate their capabilities by reviewing their portfolio consisting of their past projects. You can assess their quality by judging their creativity, work style, production value, and marketing techniques from their past works. Once you are convinced of their skills and capabilities, you can shortlist them.</p>

<p>Similarly, innovative marketing techniques will give you a significant edge over your competitors. You can judge a video marketing agency’s creativity if they pitch unique ideas, creative storytelling, and innovative marketing approaches. Watch out for the reviews to determine if the company has a proven record of creativity in their field.</p>

Proper search engine optimization helps a video rank higher in search results and get more organic audiences.</p>
<p>Optimization techniques vary for search engines, video streaming websites, and social media platforms. A video marketing agency should have expertise in optimization for organic reach and generating leads.</p>

<h5 id="Step-7-Dive-Into-the-Process"><a href="#Step-7-Dive-Into-the-Process" class="headerlink" title="Step 7 Dive Into the Process"></a>Step 7 Dive Into the Process</h5><p>You should choose a video agency that is more open about its operation and process of execution. They must explain the entire process, from concept development to final delivery. Similarly, they should be open to suggestions, flexible in approaches, and adaptable during challenges.</p>
<p>Understanding the execution process will help you determine instinctively if the agency is worth your investment. There should be clarity in the thought process and executive plan with deadline and budget for your peace of mind and satisfaction.</p>

<h5 id="Step-8-Focus-on-Communication"><a href="#Step-8-Focus-on-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Step 8 Focus on Communication"></a>Step 8 Focus on Communication</h5><p>Communication is a highly underrated skill in the professional world, especially when outsourcing your work to an agency. Without proper communication, there cannot be a proper collaboration with the <strong>video marketing company</strong>. If you cannot share your feedback or get involved in the required process, your goals and objectives will stay unachieved.</p>
<p>Therefore, while discussing the execution plan, you should emphasize communication. For example, you can check how often you will get updates and how responsive and proactive the agency will be with suggestions and feedback. Communication enhances transparency in execution and boosts customer satisfaction.</p>

It is time to request a proposal or quotation from the interested agencies. You should reiterate your goals, objectives, expectations, and requirements so the agencies can provide tailored proposals accordingly.</p>
<p>You can also clarify any doubts and assess their professionalism and communication well. The proposals can reveal the level of service you will get. The more detailed the proposal, the deeper you can evaluate the service and make the final selection accordingly.</p>

<h5 id="Step-8-Focus-on-Communication-3"><a href="#Step-8-Focus-on-Communication-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 8 Focus on Communication"></a>Step 8 Focus on Communication</h5><p>Communication is a highly underrated skill in the professional world, especially when outsourcing your work to an agency. Without proper communication, there cannot be a proper collaboration with the <strong>video marketing company</strong>. If you cannot share your feedback or get involved in the required process, your goals and objectives will stay unachieved.</p>
<p>Therefore, while discussing the execution plan, you should emphasize communication. For example, you can check how often you will get updates and how responsive and proactive the agency will be with suggestions and feedback. Communication enhances transparency in execution and boosts customer satisfaction.</p>

It is time to request a proposal or quotation from the interested agencies. You should reiterate your goals, objectives, expectations, and requirements so the agencies can provide tailored proposals accordingly.</p>
<p>You can also clarify any doubts and assess their professionalism and communication well. The proposals can reveal the level of service you will get. The more detailed the proposal, the deeper you can evaluate the service and make the final selection accordingly.</p>

You will also get to know the hidden charges and deliveries, and you should consider an agency that mentions them upfront for transparency.

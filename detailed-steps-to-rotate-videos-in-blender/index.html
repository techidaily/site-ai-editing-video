<p>In this tutorial, we have shown you two different ways to rotate a video in Blender. The first way is by using the Transform Properties window, and the second way is by using the 3D Viewport.</p>
<p>Which method you use is up to you. However, we recommend using the 3D Viewport method, as it is more accurate.</p>
<p>Rotating a video in Blender can be used for other purposes than just rotating it.</p>
<p>Here are some other things that you can do with a rotated video:</p>
<p>- Scale the video up or down</p>
<p>- Flip the video horizontally or vertically</p>
<p>- Change the position of the video in the 3D Viewport</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we have shown you two different ways to rotate a video in Blender. The first way is by using the Transform Properties window, and the second way is by using the 3D Viewport.</p>
<p>Which method you use is up to you. However, we recommend using the 3D Viewport method, as it is more accurate.</p>
<p>Rotating a video in Blender can be used for other purposes than just rotating it.</p>
<p>Here are some other things that you can do with a rotated video:</p>
<p>- Scale the video up or down</p>
<p>- Flip the video horizontally or vertically</p>
<p>- Change the position of the video in the 3D Viewport</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-HDR-photography"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-HDR-photography" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is HDR photography?"></a>Part 1: What is HDR photography?</h2><p>First things first. Before using the HDR feature on your smartphone, let’s learn what actually is the function of HDR.</p>
<p>Standing for High Dynamic Range, HDR is an image capturing method where the dynamic range of an image is high. When we talk about dynamic range, it refers to the difference between the lightest and the darkest elements of a picture. Thus, in HDR images the range dynamic range of the image is greater than the actual capture and thus making the image look more real with higher contrast, colors, and saturation.</p>
<p>While using the HDR image capturing method, the subject is captured in multiple shots having different exposures. These multiple captured shots are then combined into a single picture thus making it look detailed and saturated.</p>
<p>Though HDR enhances the overall looks of an image it is not suitable only in certain situations and subjects like landscape, subjects captured in sunlight or bright background, low or dim light conditions, and more.</p>

A simpler alternative to this is using an Android device. The principle of capturing HDR images using an Android phone is simpler in comparison to a professional DSLR camera and also quick. Using an Android device, the imbalance in the exposure is corrected and the details of the image background, as well as the foreground, are enhanced.</p>
<p><strong>How-to steps to check the HDR camera Android feature</strong></p>
<p>So now that you know that HDR images can be easily captured using your Android device, the next important thing is to check if your phone supports the HDR feature or not as not all Android devices have the HDR mode. Below listed are some of the options where you can the HDR option in the camera app of your Android device.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check for the HDR option under the Shooting Mode menu (this can be found on high-end Samsung phones.)</li>
<li>In the devices like HTC One X, Desire X, and others with custom Camera apps, the feature can be found under the Camera Scenes section.</li>
<li>In case you cannot locate the HDR option in both the above methods then try looking for it under the Settings menu of Camera. Devices like Sony Xperia T and Xperia V have the option here.</li>
<li>For the Nexus 4 device that runs on Android 4.2 OS, the option of HDR mode can be turned on by simply long-tapping the viewfinder and then tapping on the HDR icon.</li>
<li>You may also find the option of HDR mode under the labels like Backlight HDR or Backlight Correction HDR. On the Samsung Galaxy devices, HDR is labeled as Rich Tone and can be located under the Smart Modes menu.</li>
</ul>

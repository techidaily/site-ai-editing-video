<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Use-3D-Camera-Tracking-Effects-in-After-Effects"><a href="#How-to-Use-3D-Camera-Tracking-Effects-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="How to Use 3D Camera Tracking Effects in After Effects"></a>How to Use 3D Camera Tracking Effects in After Effects</h2><p>Adobe After Effects is an ever-growing product, with new features introduced almost every year. One of these features is the 3D <strong>Camera Tracking,</strong> which allows you to take your motion graphic effects to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Camera Tracking</strong> is extracting the camera movement from a recorded video sequence. This process allows filmmakers to add computer-generated elements to a live action shot, track objects throughout a shot for compositing, and estimate camera movements for virtual reality applications.</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore what Camera <strong>Tracking</strong> is and Motion Tracking in After Effect. We’ll also show you how to use 3D Camera Tracking in After Effects on a Windows PC.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Camera-Tracking"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Camera-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Camera Tracking"></a>Part 1. What Is Camera Tracking</h2><p>Camera Tracking is a process that determines the movement of a video clip. This information can be used to add certain effects to the video, such as objects that seem to follow the camera or text that appears to be stationary in the frame.</p>
<p>Camera Tracking is a relatively simple process, but it can be time-consuming. However, the results are often worth the effort, as it can add a whole new level of realism to your footage clips.</p>
<p>For example, you have taken a video clip of a zoo and want to add an object to it while making sure it gives a realistic look. This is where the <strong>Camera Tracking</strong> feature can help you make a smooth transition and add the element as if it was there.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Use-Camera-Tracking"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Use-Camera-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Use Camera Tracking?"></a>Part 2. Why Use Camera Tracking?</h2><p>Now that you know what Camera Tracking is, let’s have a look at some benefits of using it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a 3D object or element to a 2D video clip.</li>
<li>Embed objects, texts, etc., to a video.</li>
<li>Stabilize a shaky camera&#x2F;video clip.</li>
<li>Create special effects.</li>
<li>Apply color grading.</li>
<li>Replace a TV or PC screen with some information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, if you need some basic compositions or advanced ones, the Camera Tracking feature will help you track your videos, embed anything you want, or create special effects to make your clip different.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Motion-Tracking-In-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-3-Motion-Tracking-In-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Motion Tracking In After Effects"></a>Part 3. Motion Tracking In After Effects</h2><p>The Motion Tracking capability is Adobe After Effects’ feature that allows you to track the movement of the camera&#x2F;an object in a video clip and use the data to add effects to objects.</p>
<p>Motion tracking can be used for various effects, like creating realistic text animations or adding special effects to objects in a video.</p>
<p>There are four main types of Motion Tracking in After Effects, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:</p>
<h3 id="Single-Point-Tracking"><a href="#Single-Point-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Single Point Tracking"></a>Single Point Tracking</h3><p>Single Point tracking tracks a single position in a video clip. You can use it for composing a video clip with a single point of focus, and it is suitable for following the movement of an object with right-left or up-down motion.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage:</strong> Single Point Tracking is perfect for tracking a single position or motion of a single object.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> No scale or rotation properties and needs a clear contrast point for effective results.</p>
<h3 id="Two-Point-Tracking"><a href="#Two-Point-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Two Point Tracking"></a>Two Point Tracking</h3><p>Two Point Tracking is a feature that allows you to track two points in a footage clip and can be used for scale, motion, and rotation tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage:</strong> Two Point Tracking can track scale and rotation along with the motion.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> It doesn’t give effective results with a shaky video clip.</p>
<h3 id="Four-Point-Tracking"><a href="#Four-Point-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Four Point Tracking"></a>Four Point Tracking</h3><p>The Four Point Tracking feature lets you track four different points (corners) in your footage and apply the tracking data to a layer in your composition.</p>
<p>The four points can be placed at the screen’s corners in your shot, and new footage is applied to cover the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage:</strong> Directly pins the data to each corner of the image.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Cannot be used to create a 3D object.</p>
<h3 id="3D-Camera-Tracking"><a href="#3D-Camera-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="3D Camera Tracking"></a>3D Camera Tracking</h3><p>With 3D camera tracking, you can track the movement of a camera in a video and place 3D elements in the scene that match the camera’s movement. This is a great way to add realism to your graphics and make them look like they’re part of the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage:</strong> 3D Camera Tracking can help you add shapes, texts, or 3D objects to 2D footage.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> A bit tricky and needs an expert grip on the tool to use effectively.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Ray-Tracing"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Ray-Tracing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?"></a>Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?</h2><p>Ray Tracing is a powerful rendering technique that can create incredibly realistic lighting and shadows. By tracing the path of light, algorithms can simulate the way that light interacts with virtual objects in a computer-generated world.</p>
<p>This results in more lifelike shadows, reflections, and translucence. Ray Tracing has been responsible for the dramatic increase in realism we’ve seen in video games over the years, and its benefits are only becoming more apparent as technology improves.</p>
<p>In simple words, Ray Tracing is a computer graphics technique for generating realistic images and works by tracing the light’s path from the camera through the scene. This allows for accurate simulations of light interactions, such as reflection, refraction, and shadows.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Overview-Of-Ray-Tracing"><a href="#Part-2-Overview-Of-Ray-Tracing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Overview Of Ray Tracing"></a>Part 2. Overview Of Ray Tracing</h2><p>In this part, we will explain what Ray Tracing is from the following sides and for your better understanding.</p>
<h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Albrecht Dürer first gave the idea of Ray Tracing in the 16th century through his invention, the Dürer’s door. However, it was not until 1968 that Arthur Appel used a computer for the first time to create a shaded picture through Ray Tracing.</p>
<p>First conceptualized in 1969, Ray Tracing is a common technique used to create computer-generated graphics for movies and TV shows today. This is because studios can use the processing power of multiple computers to get the job done quickly and efficiently. However, even with this extra processing power, Ray Tracing can be a long and difficult process.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, Ray Tracing is becoming increasingly popular due to computer hardware and software advances. And as technology continues to improve, we can expect to see even more realistic images in the future.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages"><a href="#Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h3><p>Here’re some advantages of Ray Tracing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Realistic Rendering:</strong> Ray Tracing can create more realistic images than those created with traditional rendering techniques. This is because it calculates the light path more accurately, resulting in more realistic shadows, refraction, and reflections.</li>

How Does Ray Tracing Work?</h2><p>Ray Tracking uses the process of denoising. The algorithm starts with the camera and traces the shades of shadows and lights.</p>
<p>Ray Tracing uses machine learning to fill in the gaps to form a realistic image. The brighter the scene, the higher the graphics quality; the higher the quality, the more expensive it is. This is why Ray Tracing didn’t become popular in the video game industry until recently.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Ray-Tracing-In-Adobe-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-4-Ray-Tracing-In-Adobe-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Ray Tracing In Adobe After Effects"></a>Part 4. Ray Tracing In Adobe After Effects</h2><p>After the introduction of Ray Tracing, we will combine it with a popular video editor - Adobe After Effects to see how it works. Adobe After Effects is a useful and powerful tool for creating visual effects and animated graphics. Adobe introduced Ray Tracing or <strong>Ray-Traced 3D</strong> feature in After Effect to help graphic designers create photorealistic 3D images and render light and shadow. This feature was added in 2012 with the release of After Effects CS 6.</p>

                      alt="ray tracing in adobe after effects"
                ></p>
<p>However, the Ray Tracing feature was later removed from After Effects in 2020 due to multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Ray Tracing tool always faced bugs and glitches.</li>
<li>This feature did not work correctly if you were not using Adobe Media Encoder.</li>
<li>NVIDIA would change the standards from time to time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Functions"><a href="#Functions" class="headerlink" title="Functions"></a>Functions</h3><p>Though as mentioned above, the Ray Tracing feature was removed in 2020, its advanced 3D features are still worth of introducing. Here’re some functions of <strong>Ray Traced 3D After Effects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ray Traced allows you to generate and place multiple lights.</li>
<li>You can set a material option for 3D layers.</li>
<li>Moreover, you can control how shadows are cast.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Does It Work"></a>How Does It Work</h3><p>3D Ray Tracing in After Effects works by giving your text and paths more depth. Extruded layers have a z-axis depth, making them three-dimensional. This extra dimension is viewable from all angles, even when the layer is rotated. In contrast, non-extruded layers have zero depth on the z-axis. So, they will disappear if you try to rotate them 90 degrees on the x or y-axis.</p>

Ray-Traced 3D Settings In Adobe After Effects</h2><p>The release of the <strong>Ray-Traced 3D</strong> setting in After Effects CS6 made it easier than ever to create stunning 3D images and animations. Let’s focus on how to use it in After Effects appropriately.</p>
<h3 id="How-To-Set-It"><a href="#How-To-Set-It" class="headerlink" title="How To Set It"></a>How To Set It</h3><p>Adobe After Effects has a three-dimensional space animation setting, but this doesn’t include Ray Tracing. You need to change the default settings if you want to use it in your animation. To do so:</p>
<p>Step1 Go to the <strong>Composition Settings</strong> panel to set up the <strong>Ray-Traced 3D</strong> composition.</p>
<p>Step2 Open the <strong>Advanced tab,</strong> and from the <strong>“Renderer”</strong> option, select <strong>“Ray-Traced 3D”</strong> from the drop-down menu.</p>

                ></p>
<p>A layer becomes a 3D layer when the 3D checkbox is checked in the timeline and has more options than a normal layer regarding composition. When you open the layer properties timeline, you can access two options: Geometry Options and Material Options.</p>
<p>The former deals with the layer’s depth and edges shape, while the latter deals with the interaction of layers with depth and includes shadow, reflection, refraction, and transparency option.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Ray-Tracing-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Ray-Tracing-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?"></a>Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?</h2><p>Ray Tracing is a powerful rendering technique that can create incredibly realistic lighting and shadows. By tracing the path of light, algorithms can simulate the way that light interacts with virtual objects in a computer-generated world.</p>
<p>This results in more lifelike shadows, reflections, and translucence. Ray Tracing has been responsible for the dramatic increase in realism we’ve seen in video games over the years, and its benefits are only becoming more apparent as technology improves.</p>
<p>In simple words, Ray Tracing is a computer graphics technique for generating realistic images and works by tracing the light’s path from the camera through the scene. This allows for accurate simulations of light interactions, such as reflection, refraction, and shadows.</p>

Overview Of Ray Tracing</h2><p>In this part, we will explain what Ray Tracing is from the following sides and for your better understanding.</p>
<h3 id="History-1"><a href="#History-1" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Albrecht Dürer first gave the idea of Ray Tracing in the 16th century through his invention, the Dürer’s door. However, it was not until 1968 that Arthur Appel used a computer for the first time to create a shaded picture through Ray Tracing.</p>
<p>First conceptualized in 1969, Ray Tracing is a common technique used to create computer-generated graphics for movies and TV shows today. This is because studios can use the processing power of multiple computers to get the job done quickly and efficiently. However, even with this extra processing power, Ray Tracing can be a long and difficult process.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, Ray Tracing is becoming increasingly popular due to computer hardware and software advances. And as technology continues to improve, we can expect to see even more realistic images in the future.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-1"><a href="#Advantages-1" class="headerlink" title="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h3><p>Here’re some advantages of Ray Tracing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Realistic Rendering:</strong> Ray Tracing can create more realistic images than those created with traditional rendering techniques. This is because it calculates the light path more accurately, resulting in more realistic shadows, refraction, and reflections.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-aliasing And Depth Of Field:</strong> Ray Tracing can help you quickly get the anti-aliasing and depth of field effects.</li>
</ol>

<p>Consumers enjoy discord because it serves as a hub for their social groups and communities. It’s a haven where users can be themselves while socializing with others who share their interests and hobbies. There is no algorithm selecting what they should see, no continuous scrolling, and no news feed. Common interests fuel conversations and you can use some fun discord bots to pep up the conversation.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Use them in the first slide as a title slide. Whenever you use a GIF in the first or the introductory slide, you automatically initiate your presentation with something unique. And as a result, you successfully grab the audience’ leave a good impression.

This, in turn, helps make your slideshow more appealing and more enjoyable. The more fun you add to anything, the more attractive it will be. And adding GIFs in slideshows can be the best way of doing so.</p>
<p>Now, let us discuss the next important question about using the GIFs: when should we use them? You must know that <strong>gifs on google slides</strong> can be used in a limited way. So, here are the different ways you can really and readily integrate GIFs in your slideshows.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use them in the first slide as a title slide. Whenever you use a GIF in the first or the introductory slide, you automatically initiate your presentation with something unique. And as a result, you successfully grab the audience’ leave a good impression. Additionally, from the first slide itself, you tend to have a comfortable and positive environment to continue your presentation more impeccably.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use URL GIFs. There are plenty of them; therefore, you can have abundant choices and choose the best among them, especially the more relatable and engaging ones. The URL GIFs are plentily used in chat. So, adding them to your slides makes it more interesting, relatable and praiseworthy. However, it would be best to be careful about the copyright aspect. Ensure not to use URL GIFs that can face you with copyright issues.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also use the screengrabs; you can easily pull the attention of your audience to different parts of your content, one after the another, most systematically and effectively. As a result, you can explain and express your content in the most detailed way possible.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Either type of GIF that you can use are charts and graphs. In the first place, putting graphs and charts tend to make your presentation more organised, factual and professional. So, when you include GIFs of charts and graphs, you take the beneficial qualities of your display a notch higher.</p>

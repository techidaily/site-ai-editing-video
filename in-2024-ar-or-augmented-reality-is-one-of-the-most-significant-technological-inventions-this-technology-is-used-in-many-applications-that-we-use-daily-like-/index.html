</ul>
<h3 id="Solution-1-Lower-Playback-Resolution"><a href="#Solution-1-Lower-Playback-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Lower Playback Resolution"></a>Solution 1: Lower Playback Resolution</h3><p>In DaVinci Resolve, full timeline proxy resolution is set by default. To enjoy a smooth playback while editing, you should reduce the playback resolution. Open your project in DaVinci Resolve and press the “Playback” menu from the top. Then, select “Timeline Proxy Resolution” and pick one either “Half” or “Quarter” options. It will reduce the playback resolution and speed up the playback.</p>

<h3 id="Solution-2-Change-Timeline-Resolution"><a href="#Solution-2-Change-Timeline-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Solution 2: Change Timeline Resolution"></a>Solution 2: Change Timeline Resolution</h3><p>DaVinci Resolve can work on 4K high-resolution footage that might disrupt the playback. So, cutting down the resolution to speed up your playback is suggested. To do so, click the “Settings” icon from the bottom right side and enter the “Project Settings” window.

Create a slow-motion video to emphasize certain information in the video. It involves technical and creative elements for a good-quality video. You can read this section to understand the points that contribute to a good Slow-motion video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> Keep the frame rate higher for a good slow-motion video. In this regard, you can use common frame rates such as 60fps, 120fps, and 140fps. Moreover, you should pick video clips that are originally captured in a high frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> Minimize the motion blur in footage and use a faster shutter speed. It is important when you are shooting fast-moving objects. Adjusting the shutter speed can enhance the look of slow-motion videos.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> A good slow motion is only possible when it is captured in high-quality resolution. Better image quality allows more detail in such footage. Moreover, you can optimize the camera settings for the desired resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Editing and Timing:</strong> Thoughtfully chosen clips, timings, and editing can set the stage. Thus, maintain a cohesive flow and pay more attention to the video pacing. Edit all segments in a way that fits seamlessly to contribute a good slow-motion video.</li>

Create a slow-motion video to emphasize certain information in the video. It involves technical and creative elements for a good-quality video. You can read this section to understand the points that contribute to a good Slow-motion video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> Keep the frame rate higher for a good slow-motion video. In this regard, you can use common frame rates such as 60fps, 120fps, and 140fps. Moreover, you should pick video clips that are originally captured in a high frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> Minimize the motion blur in footage and use a faster shutter speed. It is important when you are shooting fast-moving objects. Adjusting the shutter speed can enhance the look of slow-motion videos.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> A good slow motion is only possible when it is captured in high-quality resolution. Better image quality allows more detail in such footage. Moreover, you can optimize the camera settings for the desired resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Editing and Timing:</strong> Thoughtfully chosen clips, timings, and editing can set the stage. Thus, maintain a cohesive flow and pay more attention to the video pacing. Edit all segments in a way that fits seamlessly to contribute a good slow-motion video.</li>

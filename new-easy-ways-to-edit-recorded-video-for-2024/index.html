            <h2 id="Easy-Ways-to-Edit-Recorded-Video"><a href="#Easy-Ways-to-Edit-Recorded-Video" class="headerlink" title="Easy Ways to Edit Recorded Video"></a>Easy Ways to Edit Recorded Video</h2><p>The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don’t need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.</p>
<p>Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you’re on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don’t have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we’ve put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you’ll need to know to make stunning films, even if you’ve never done it before. We’ll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS"></a><strong>Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS</strong></h2><p>OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It’s open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Download and Install OBS</strong></p>
<p>Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Setup Screen Recording</strong></p>
<p>The window is divided into separate parts called “docks” when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you’ll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-setup-screen-recording.jpg"
                      alt="obs setup screen recording"
                ></p>
<p>You’ll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Customize the Recording Source</strong></p>
<p>You’ll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select “Display Capture” by clicking the “+” icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click “OK”. At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.</p>

                      alt="obs customize the recording source"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you’re ready to begin recording.

However, It’s Not Easy for Everyone to Use Color Grading Feature, and in This Guide We’ll Show You How to Do That"></a>If You Want to Color Grading Your Video, Final Cut Pro Can Be One of the Best Choices. However, It’s Not Easy for Everyone to Use Color Grading Feature, and in This Guide We’ll Show You How to Do That</h2><p>Have you ever questioned the purpose of those odd video scopes or how to build super grades from the start in Final Cut Pro? In contrast to editing talents, color grading is a technical and difficult ability that takes practice.</p>
<p>In order to help, we decided to compile a thorough beginner’s article to color grading in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>With that said, let’s begin!</p>
<h2 id="1-Discover-how-you-color-grade-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#1-Discover-how-you-color-grade-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. Discover how you color grade in Final Cut Pro"></a>1. Discover how you color grade in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Color grading may be a tedious and time-consuming operation, therefore it’s a skill set that calls for a lot of patience. Some editors won’t conduct any color grading or correction beyond the bare minimum. But even mundane-looking film may look remarkable if you know how to give it a dramatic touch.</p>
<p>A more cinematic grade requires a number of procedures, and there is no one method that works for all situations. We’ll therefore walk you through the process of creating a cinematic color grade in Final Cut Pro, but depending on your material, you might need to add or omit some phases.</p>
<h5 id="Step1Filming"><a href="#Step1Filming" class="headerlink" title="Step1Filming"></a>Step1Filming</h5><p>Since the raw video is essential for producing a cinematic image, an outstanding grade begins with the camera.</p>
<p>Use the greatest quality settings your camera offers while recording your video; the more information in your picture, the more you can manipulate it during grading.</p>
<p>While it may seem preferable to shoot with as much color as you can, using a duller color profile is very necessary. Your camera will have color settings, and although the washed-out, drab appearance may not inspire confidence in you, it will offer you a lot more editing possibility.</p>
<h5 id="Step2Create-a-color-profile"><a href="#Step2Create-a-color-profile" class="headerlink" title="Step2Create a color profile"></a>Step2Create a color profile</h5><p>After importing your film, you may be concerned about the general dull look of your recordings. The reason for that is because you have not yet matched the color profile of your sequence to the one of your camera. To start on this process, it goes as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag your clip onto your timeline and make sure it is selected. Click on the Inspector icon.</li>
<li>Then click on the Information tab of the clip.</li>
<li>Navigate all the way down through the options to find the Color LUT option.</li>
<li>Then choose the Color profile that matches your clip based on the camera it is filmed with.</li>
<li>You’re done!</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step3Checking-the-scopes"><a href="#Step3Checking-the-scopes" class="headerlink" title="Step3Checking the scopes"></a>Step3Checking the scopes</h5><p>The Scopes in Final Cut Pro are panels that display the color information of your shots. They are quite complicated and can be difficult to comprehend if you did not use them ever before. You can activate Video Scopes by clicking View &gt; Show in Viewer &gt; Video Scopes from the View menu. The three components of grading are the highlights, mid-tones, and shadows. Your highlights are shown at the top and your shadows are at the bottom in all grading tools and scopes.</p>
<h2 id="2-Include-Color-Wheels"><a href="#2-Include-Color-Wheels" class="headerlink" title="2. Include Color Wheels"></a>2. Include Color Wheels</h2><p>Now that your setup is complete, you can begin grading your footage. Grading is done in multiple layers stacked on top of each other. It may take multiple levels to create the desired look. Follow the instructions below to modify your settings to match your clip if you want to give your footage a cinematic look.</p>
<p>You may access a wider range of color manipulation tools with the built-in color wheels, exposure adjustments, including isolation of color selection, RGB modifications across tone ranges, and simple masking.</p>
<h2 id="3-Color-board"><a href="#3-Color-board" class="headerlink" title="3. Color board"></a>3. Color board</h2><p>A vertical color spectrum is shown on the Color Board, and it is intersected by a horizontal line that features four nodes. These are the ranges of the footage that are designated as the Highlights, Midtones, and Shadows, respectively.</p>
<p>Adjusting a node to a new color space has an immediate and noticeable impact on the corresponding section of the image. If you move above the horizontal line, it will increase, and if you go below the line, it will decrease.</p>
<p>You also have control over the Saturation and Exposure settings. These are wonderful to have if you want to increase the contrast in your photographs and make particular colors more vivid or muted.</p>
<h2 id="4-Masks"><a href="#4-Masks" class="headerlink" title="4. Masks"></a>4. Masks</h2><p>Using the Shape Masks feature, each of these individual effects can be perfect for particular regions of your footage. In addition, by utilizing a Color Mask, you can alter the appearance of a specific color. It is possible to apply multiple iterations of each color adjustment to a clip and find it listed under the Effect heading.</p>
<p>The order can be changed by dragging and dropping, and either method can be disabled or enabled. Utilizing keyframes allows for the effects of color grading to be specifically timed as well.

<p>It’s not likely that a single tool or adjustment will solve an issue or produce the desired result; rather, it’s more likely that a number of different impacts will be required.

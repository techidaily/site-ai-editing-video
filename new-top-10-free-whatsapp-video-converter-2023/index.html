But my cousin has sent me a video of 35 MB, with (a) 5:40 minutes duration. How has this been possible?”</p>
<p>Indeed, WhatsApp has size and format-related restrictions, like a 16 MB size limit. However, you can access the WhatsApp Web version to share longer videos since it allows a size limit of 64 MB. Alternatively, you can <strong>reduce video size for WhatsApp</strong> with converter tools to compress, convert, and optimize video files**.**</p>

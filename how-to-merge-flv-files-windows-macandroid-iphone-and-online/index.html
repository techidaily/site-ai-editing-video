<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide to Merge FLV files on Windows&#x2F;Mac using Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Launch Wondershare Filmora and load FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>When you run this FLV joiner, simply click <strong>“Import”</strong> to load all of the local FLV files that you want to merge to the User’s album of this FLV video merger. You can also just drag and drop the target files from your PC into the album.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/merge-flv-1.jpg"
                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Merge FLV files into one…</strong></p>
<p>At the bottom of this FLV file merger, there lies a <strong>Timeline</strong>. Drag FLV files from the album to the Timeline and use the slider bar to help you arrange all FLV files in the Timeline without overlapping them. That’s very important as if you put one video to another, the original video will get split. Also, make sure that all FLV files are placed in the sequence in which they are to be played. If not, you can rearrange any video clip with a simple drag-and-drop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Choose the target format as FLV…</strong></p>
<p>When you are sure that all FLV files are in the correct required order on the Timeline, you can view the effect in real-time in the preview pane. If everything is fine, you are now ready to export this new FLV file. All you have to do is just press the <strong>“Create”</strong></p>
<p>button, then go to the <strong>“Format” tab &gt; “FLV” output format</strong> in the output window.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Export a new FLV file…</strong></p>
<p>Finally, click the <strong>“Create”</strong> button to save the settings and export the new FLV file simultaneously. When it’s done, simply navigate to the whole FLV video using the output file path.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Way to Merge&#x2F;Combine FLV Files on Windows</strong></p>
<p><strong>Joyoshare Media Cutter (Paid tool to merge FLV Files)</strong></p>
<p>Joyoshare Video Joiner for Windows is a comprehensive and user-friendly audio and video merging software that supports a wide range of file formats such as FLV, F4V, HD,4K, MP4, M4V, M4A, DV, MPEG, FLAV, WMA, and others. It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner. There are two options: click <strong>“Open File”</strong> to choose them or drag them directly into the software.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose a merging mode and export format…</strong></p>
<p>You must pick a format from high-speed mode and encoding mode based on your requirements by using the <strong>“Format”</strong> button. The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Remove undesirable parts…</strong></p>
<p>Once finished choosing mode and format, simply press <strong>“OK”</strong> to go back to the main screen. Then double-click these FLV files one by one to preview them. You can change the timeline to remove unnecessary sections from your FLV videos. Moreover, renaming and rearranging these video files can also be realized in this step.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit FLV files (optional)…</strong></p>
<p>The software has an editor that allows you to easily and flexibly enhance your FLV video files by clicking <strong>“Edit”</strong> next to each file before joining.</p>

<p><strong>Joyoshare Media Cutter (Paid tool to merge FLV Files)</strong></p>

It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner. There are two options: click <strong>“Open File”</strong> to choose them or drag them directly into the software.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Choose a merging mode and export format…</strong></p>
<p>You must pick a format from high-speed mode and encoding mode based on your requirements by using the <strong>“Format”</strong> button. The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner.

<p><strong>Step 2: Choose a merging mode and export format…</strong></p>
<p>You must pick a format from high-speed mode and encoding mode based on your requirements by using the <strong>“Format”</strong> button. The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner.

<p><strong>Step 2: Choose a merging mode and export format…</strong></p>
<p>You must pick a format from high-speed mode and encoding mode based on your requirements by using the <strong>“Format”</strong> button. The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

This is where the <strong>Google stabilizer video</strong> editing feature comes into play. You can stabilize a video with the Google Photos app that has a built-in video stabilizer and other editing tools to give a finishing touch to your media files before they are shared online or with family, friends, and&#x2F;or colleagues.</p>
<p>In this article, we will show you how to use Google Photos as a <strong>stabilizer video Google</strong> offers to its consumer. In addition, you will also learn about one of the most trusted and efficient third-party tools to stabilize the clips if <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong> fails to produce quality output.</p>

<p>The program can store photos and videos from your phone, and ensures that those media files are well-backed up so they can be recovered easily if&#x2F;when lost due to some mishaps. Furthermore, the tool even lets you edit, customize, and share your photos and videos with ease.</p>
<p><strong>1. History and Current Policies</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, Google Photos used to offer unlimited storage to the users where they can save as many photos as they want, as long as the images were saved in ‘high-quality’ resolution. However, from June 01, 2021, Google changed its policies of using the app, and now the tool offers limited storage. If more space is needed, the users must subscribe to a paid plan.</p>
<p><strong>2. Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.</p>
<p><strong>3. Deletion</strong></p>
<p>The files that are stored in Google Photos remain there for an indefinite duration, of course until the entire space is completely consumed. When you delete something, it is moved to the Trash and stays there for another 60 days, after which it is automatically deleted from the Cloud forever.</p>

Using the built-in <strong>Google stabilizer video</strong> editor of the Photos app on both platforms is almost identical and extremely easy.</p>
<p>You can learn how to work with <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong> to stabilize a video by following the steps that are given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Locate and Open the Source Video in Google Photos</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>5. Filters</strong></p>
<p>You can even add a filter using the presets available in the ‘Filters’ section.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="filters google photos"
                ></p>
<p><strong>6. Annotations</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Markup’ section enables you to annotate the video. You can either use the ‘Pen’ tool or ‘Highlighter’ to write text on the video or give the screen a different shade respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>The program can store photos and videos from your phone, and ensures that those media files are well-backed up so they can be recovered easily if&#x2F;when lost due to some mishaps. Furthermore, the tool even lets you edit, customize, and share your photos and videos with ease.</p>
<p><strong>1. History and Current Policies</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, Google Photos used to offer unlimited storage to the users where they can save as many photos as they want, as long as the images were saved in ‘high-quality’ resolution. However, from June 01, 2021, Google changed its policies of using the app, and now the tool offers limited storage. If more space is needed, the users must subscribe to a paid plan.</p>
<p><strong>2. Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.</p>
<p><strong>3. Deletion</strong></p>
<p>The files that are stored in Google Photos remain there for an indefinite duration, of course until the entire space is completely consumed. When you delete something, it is moved to the Trash and stays there for another 60 days, after which it is automatically deleted from the Cloud forever.</p>

Using the built-in <strong>Google stabilizer video</strong> editor of the Photos app on both platforms is almost identical and extremely easy.</p>
<p>You can learn how to work with <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong> to stabilize a video by following the steps that are given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Locate and Open the Source Video in Google Photos</strong></p>
<p>Download and install Google Photos on your smartphone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for illustrations). Launch the app, tap <strong>Library</strong> from the bottom-right corner of the interface, and tap to open the source video that you want to stabilize with <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong>.</p>

<p>After the video opens in the app and the playback begins, tap <strong>Edit</strong> from the bottom. On the next screen, ensure that the <strong>Video</strong> section is selected. Tap the <strong>Stabilize</strong> icon from the lower-left area of the window, and wait while <strong>Google Photos stabilize video</strong>.</p>

Using the built-in <strong>Google stabilizer video</strong> editor of the Photos app on both platforms is almost identical and extremely easy.</p>
<p>You can learn how to work with <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong> to stabilize a video by following the steps that are given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Locate and Open the Source Video in Google Photos</strong></p>
<p>Download and install Google Photos on your smartphone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for illustrations). Launch the app, tap <strong>Library</strong> from the bottom-right corner of the interface, and tap to open the source video that you want to stabilize with <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong>.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-video-to-stabilize.jpg"
                      alt="open video to stabilize"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Stabilize the Video</strong></p>
<p>After the video opens in the app and the playback begins, tap <strong>Edit</strong> from the bottom. On the next screen, ensure that the <strong>Video</strong> section is selected. Tap the <strong>Stabilize</strong> icon from the lower-left area of the window, and wait while <strong>Google Photos stabilize video</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="stabilize video with google photos"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Save the Video</strong></p>
<p>Once the stabilization process is complete, click <strong>Save copy</strong> from the bottom-right corner to save the modified video as a separate copy, thus leaving the original instance intact.</p>

But if you are using a Windows or Mac computer, you can try some <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >free online video stabilization software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or use <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to stabilize video with one click.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora video editor is available for Windows and Mac platforms, and gives a tough competition to other industry-standard video editing applications like Final Cut Pro X and Adobe Premiere Pro, etc. You can learn how to stabilize a clip with Filmora instead of using <strong>Google stabilizer video</strong> editor by following the step-by-step instructions that are explained below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add the Source Video to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>After downloading and installing Wondershare Filmora on your Mac or Windows computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), launch the program, and click the <strong>New Project</strong> tile from the first screen that appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-start-screen.jpg"
                      alt="filmora start screen"
                ></p>
<p>When on the main interface, ensure that <strong>Media</strong> is selected from the standard toolbar at the top, and click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window that is present at the upper-left corner. Next, locate, select, and import the source video from your PC that you want to stabilize.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-library-interface-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="media library interface filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Now, drag and drop the video to the timeline, or hover the mouse over the clip’s thumbnail in the <strong>Media</strong> window, click the <strong>+</strong> icon from the bottom-right area. Click the button under the <strong>Match to Media</strong> or <strong>Keep Project Settings</strong> label when the confirmation box comes up to add the film to the Timeline using the preferences that you selected.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import video to stabilize timeline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Stabilize the Video</strong></p>
<p>Double click the video in the timeline, and then enable the <strong>Stabilization</strong> category under video editing pane. Wait while Filmora video editor stabilizes the video without <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong>. Click <strong>OK</strong> when done.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="enable stabilize video filmora video editor"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Export the Stabilized Video</strong></p>
<p>Back on the main interface, click <strong>Export</strong> from the center-top. On the <strong>Export</strong> box that opens up next, go to your preferred tab, pick an output format, define output preferences, and click <strong>Export</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the stabilized clip without even using <strong>Google stabilizer video</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-Google-Photos-to-Edit-Video-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-Google-Photos-to-Edit-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use Google Photos to Edit Video?"></a>Part 4: How to Use Google Photos to Edit Video?</h2><p>Google Photos doesn’t only work as a <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong> app but it also enables you to edit your media clips much more professionally. Some post-production tasks that you can perform while using Google Photos include:</p>
<p><strong>1. Trimming</strong></p>
<p>The trimming handles can be seen when you are on the ‘Video’ section after tapping ‘Edit’ in Google Photos after opening the video. You can drag these handles inwards to get rid of the unwanted starting and ending parts of a clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-photos-trim-video.jpg"
                      alt="google photos trim video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>2. Cropping</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Crop’ section enables you to crop the videos in a particular aspect ratio that can be selected from the available list, or drag the handles manually to get custom results.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-photos-crop-video.jpg"
                      alt="google photos crop video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>3. Rotating</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Crop’ section also has an option to rotate the video. Each time you tap the ‘Rotate’ icon, the screen rotates 90o in the counterclockwise direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-video-google-photos.jpg"
                      alt="rotate video google photos"
                ></p>
<p><strong>4. Color Correction</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Adjust’ section allows you to adjust the display of a video such as its brightness, contrast, shadows, etc.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-color-correction-google-photos.jpg"
                      alt="video color correction google photos"
                ></p>
<p><strong>5. Filters</strong></p>
<p>You can even add a filter using the presets available in the ‘Filters’ section.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filters-google-photos.jpg"
                      alt="filters google photos"
                ></p>
<p><strong>6. Annotations</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Markup’ section enables you to annotate the video. You can either use the ‘Pen’ tool or ‘Highlighter’ to write text on the video or give the screen a different shade respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-markup-google-photos.jpg"
                      alt="video markup google photos"
                ></p>
<p>Depending on the type of modifications you want in your video, you can use Google Photos to get the job done easily and quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Google video stabilizer is a built-in tool in Google Photos. Google Photos can be obtained from Play Store or App Store for your Android or iOS smart devices respectively. In addition to stabilizing your videos, Google Photos app also enables you to make other modifications such as trimming, cropping, applying filters, and much more.</p>

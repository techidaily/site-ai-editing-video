People tend to rely on several effects to exceed the quality of the beloved videos. VHS is the most used effect, popular in professional and personal videos.

If you are new to this field, you should get familiar with the VHS effects in video. This context will provide basic information about <strong>VHS tapes</strong> and how to add VHS effects to videos.</p>

An Overview of the 70s Sensation</h2><p>From definition to usability, every piece of information plays an important role in your videography journey. Don’t worry if you don’t have video editing skills or know what <strong>VHS means</strong>. This section will provide you with reliable information about this:</p>
<h3 id="What-Do-You-Mean-by-VHS-Technology"><a href="#What-Do-You-Mean-by-VHS-Technology" class="headerlink" title="What Do You Mean by VHS Technology?"></a>What Do You Mean by VHS Technology?</h3><p>VHS, also known as Video Home System, are the auditory artifacts and visual glitches you see in the pictures. It creates a sense of distortion in the video, making the viewer think the camera equipment is malfunctioning. From the 1980s to the 1990s, this effect gained considerable popularity among video creators and viewers.</p>
<p>In recent years, retro lovers have brought this intuitive effect again into a trend to create a perfect flashback scene. The nostalgic and vintage appeal of these effects is insane. VHS is not just one effect because it divides into further categories. You are also free to select the VHS effects according to the theme of your video and the scene you are going to create.</p>
<h3 id="Key-Aspects-of-The-VHS-Effects"><a href="#Key-Aspects-of-The-VHS-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Key Aspects of The VHS Effects"></a>Key Aspects of The VHS Effects</h3><p>Several key aspects are crucial to making high-quality VHS effects in the videos. You can see some of the key aspects listed and discussed here:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Tracking Lines of VHS:**The <strong>VHS tapes</strong> are integrated with magnetic strips to sort audio and video signals. However, over time, these tapes degraded, leading to glitches in playback with noticeable distortion.</li>
<li>**Video Color Bleeding:**You must have noticed that color is bleeding in the VHS videos. In this, the colors in the videos are quite smudged and mixed. This together adds the unique yet smoother distortion in the videos.</li>
<li>**Vintage and Glitching:**Vintage and glitches are essential to videos with VHS effects. This was initially caused by the limitations of playback equipment and signal interference. At this time, people add <strong>glitch VHS</strong> to the videos in a manual manner to add a sense of interference in the scene.</li>
<li>**Noise and Jitters:**VHS tapes are known to be susceptible to wrappings and jitters. It causes a slightly unstable effect in the videos in the form of distorted objects. Moreover, the grainy and noisy appearance due to analog recording technology is also a part of this effect.</li>

<p>To start your creative journey, you can hone your skills by focusing on at least one technique and progressively learning new skills. One of the various video editing techniques you can employ is double exposure. This method is based on an old technique in photography in which a film is exposed twice to create a single image. This article shows you how to use the same method to combine two or more video clips and create a double exposure effect.</p>
<p>You can create artistic videos that tell various stories and captivate viewers by using Filmora. The following steps describe how to create a double exposure effect in Filmora.</p>
<p>Step1 Download the Filmora application</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Then, the Filmora installer is automatically downloaded. To start installing Filmora, double-click the installer and click <strong>Agree</strong> to agree with the terms and conditions. Then, wait for approximately 2 minutes for the installation to complete.</p>
<p>Step2 Start a new project in Filmora</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-2.jpg"
                      alt="set up a new project"
                ></p>
<p>After a successful installation, the app automatically runs, and you can start editing videos. Click <strong>New Project</strong> to start a project on a clean canvas.</p>
<p>Before starting a new project, we recommend you plan a theme for your videos. You can incorporate different elements into your videos to convey a dramatic, light, or fun theme. This step will help you communicate the mood and message you want to convey to the audience.</p>
<p>Step3 Select a foreground video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-3.jpg"
                      alt="add a base video"
                ></p>
<p>To create a trendy double exposure effect, record a video clip with a white or neutral background. Then, import the specified video to Filmora. In the second layer of the video editing pane, drag the video.</p>
<p>The first video is called the foreground video, which serves as the base video to achieve the desired double exposure effect. It is important to choose neutral or calm colors to make it easier for you to remove the background and highlight the main subject of your video.</p>
<p>Step4 Edit the foreground video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-4.jpg"
                      alt="adjust the color settings of the foreground video"
                ></p>
<p>Edit the foreground video by adjusting the color settings. Click the <strong>Color Correction</strong> icon to open the color settings. In the <strong>Advanced Color Tuning</strong> box that appears, click <strong>Adjust</strong>. In this article, the value of <strong>Exposure</strong> is set to <strong>18,</strong> and <strong>Contrast</strong> is set to <strong>28</strong>. Then, <strong>Vibrance</strong> and <strong>Saturation</strong> are set to <strong>-100</strong>. In the <strong>Light</strong> settings, the values of <strong>Highlights</strong> and <strong>Shadows</strong> are set to <strong>-100</strong>, <strong>Whites</strong> is set to <strong>0</strong>, and <strong>Blacks</strong> is set to <strong>-30</strong>. You can experiment and play with the settings based on the theme that you want to achieve.</p>
<p>Step5 Select a background video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-5.jpg"
                      alt="import a video clip as a background video"
                ></p>
<p>For the background video, select a video clip and import the video to Filmora. Then, drag the video in a layer below the foreground video.</p>
<p>When you select a background video, make sure that the video is vibrant, colorful, and has lots of texture. For example, you can select landscapes, flowers, leaves, textured patterns, city lights, sunsets, or other graphic components. The colors and lighting in the background video significantly impact the final output’s overall appearance.</p>
<p>Step6 Blend the foreground and background videos</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-6.jpg"
                      alt="produce double exposure effect"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to produce a perfect double-exposed video, blending layers is properly essential. To do this, double click the foreground video. Go to the <strong>Compositing</strong> option and set <strong>Blending Mode</strong> to <strong>Lighten</strong>. You can also configure <strong>Blending Mode</strong> based on your preference.</p>
<p>The steps that are outlined in this article can help you apply double exposure effects to your videos. You can modify your videos to your preferences by using all the resources that Filmora provides.</p>
<p>A simple video clip with a double-exposure effect adds a dramatic and dreamy effect to it. The creator can work with colors, exposures, and brightness to achieve a double-exposure effect.

                      alt="iMovie Slideshow Creator- Making Image Pan and Transition Adjustments"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Video Adjustment Tool</strong></p>
<p>Using the ‘Video Adjustment’ option, you are granted the liberty to adjust the brightness, contrast, white point, exposure, saturation and levels of the added images. If your images have an appreciable quality by default, you can skip this step.</p>

Setting a play duration somewhere between 2-2.5 seconds would be an optimal choice. Avoid choosing shorter slide duration unless it becomes an obvious requirement, lest the audience may find it hard to process the contents.</p>
<p>Prefer adjusting the screen time separately for each slide, in case you have a large project with more than 50 slides. It is instead, advisable to time the entire project under one time frame, while setting a longer screen time for the title slide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add an Upbeat Background Audio</strong></p>
<p>Adding background music to your presentation slides is pretty simple, with you having to just position the audio files within the desired slides using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method.

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Include Still Images</strong></p>
<p>Browse through the locally saved images within your device gallery and add the desired ones at a specific point in the editor timeline using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. A green colored indicative light will mark the spot where the images are being dropped. You are free to drop all the images at the same time and sort them at a later stage. Do not close the image folder in your device until you have imported all the stills.</p>
<p>The images can be alternatively added to the timeline by selecting the required ones from the iOS device’s Photo Booth or iPhoto account. All you need to do is navigate to and hit the ‘Photo’ button to drop the selected images in the ‘Photos’ box at the bottom right corner of the software workspace.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="iMovie Slideshow Creator- Adding Images to the Presentation"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Adjust Image Pans and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Having included the desired images within the slideshow project, it is now time to improvise them with classic and enhanced looks. You can adhere to the task by making suitable changes under the ‘Video Adjustments’, ‘Crop Tool’ and ‘Clock’ options. Drag the cursor to a desired slide to see all the 3 options pop up at the top your slide screen.</p>

                      alt="iMovie Slideshow Creator- Making Image Pan and Transition Adjustments"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Video Adjustment Tool</strong></p>
<p>Using the ‘Video Adjustment’ option, you are granted the liberty to adjust the brightness, contrast, white point, exposure, saturation and levels of the added images. If your images have an appreciable quality by default, you can skip this step.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Crop Tool</strong></p>
<p>Consider working with the ‘Crop Tool’ to zoom or pan the system camera across a selected slide. Click on the ‘Fit’ option to set the image within a chosen frame size; however you need to be cautious lest using the tool may render an incorrectly cropped image. Select the ‘Crop’ option to adjust the image aspect ratio according to your specific size constraints.</p>
<p>The ‘Ken Burns’ tool, you can rely on this one to spark the slideshow images with the coolest zoom and pan effects. The tool is represented by ‘Red and Green’ boxes above the ‘Video Preview’ box in the editor timeline. You can easily move and resize the boxes using the ‘Hand’ and the ‘Cross Hair’ tools respectively. When you are satisfied with your work, hit ‘Done’ to return and confirm the changes, or click on the next presentation slide to crop and pan the same.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Clock Tool</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Clock’ icon lets you adjust the screen time of each slide, assigning a preset minimum duration of 0.25 seconds to each slide. Setting a play duration somewhere between 2-2.5 seconds would be an optimal choice. Avoid choosing shorter slide duration unless it becomes an obvious requirement, lest the audience may find it hard to process the contents.</p>
<p>Prefer adjusting the screen time separately for each slide, in case you have a large project with more than 50 slides. It is instead, advisable to time the entire project under one time frame, while setting a longer screen time for the title slide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add an Upbeat Background Audio</strong></p>
<p>Adding background music to your presentation slides is pretty simple, with you having to just position the audio files within the desired slides using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. The slides containing music pieces will have a ‘Light Green’ highlighting box under them. To correct a wrong placement, drag the audio file across the individual slides and drop at the correct space. You can further, modify the length of the audio clips by extending and trimming them.</p>
<p>To import audio files from your online iTunes account, navigate to and click within the ‘Music and Sound Effects’ box at the bottom right corner of the editor timeline. You can also clip the music file to start playing the background audio from a certain point within the track. To do this, take the cursor to the end of the track and drag the red indicator line to the point where you wish the audio to end at or begin playing from.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Share Your Presentation</strong></p>
<p>Run a mock slideshow in the ‘Preview’ box to ensure that every element of the presentation is at its specified place. When all looks good, navigate to the ‘Functions Toolbar’ at the top and hit the ‘Share’ tab to select a media sharing platform of your choice. You can even choose to export your slideshow directly from the editor timeline via QuickTime.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p>Now, without any more delay, let’s start learning how to combine videos in Filmora through the following steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Install Filmora on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>Just visit <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download the latest version of the software for your Windows or MAC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-2.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>After downloading the software on your computer, install it. Once the software is ready, double-click the “Wondershare Filmora” icon (it should be on your desktop screen) to open the program.</p>
<p>As you can see, the interface is simple with user-friendly options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-3.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Multiple Videos in Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Click on the blue icon with a “+” sign to import videos.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-4.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>Or, click on the “File” button on the top menu to import files and drag and drop both clips to the same timeline.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are two clips on the timeline. The first clip is called “Cherry Blossom,” and the second clip’s name is “Plating Food.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-5.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Keep Video Clips on the Same Timeline</strong></p>
<p>There shouldn’t be any gap or spaces between the two clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-6.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>It is because gaps will create a dark blank space between the clips when you export the clips, like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-7.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>Therefore, slide the second video right next to the first video without leaving any gaps with your mouse.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-8.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>And guess what? You have already merged the two clips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save Video on Your PC</strong></p>
<p>Now, hit the “Export” button and save the merged video on your computer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-9.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>

<p>Now, without any more delay, let’s start learning how to combine videos in Filmora through the following steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Install Filmora on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>Just visit <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download the latest version of the software for your Windows or MAC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-2.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>After downloading the software on your computer, install it. Once the software is ready, double-click the “Wondershare Filmora” icon (it should be on your desktop screen) to open the program.</p>
<p>As you can see, the interface is simple with user-friendly options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-3.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Multiple Videos in Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Click on the blue icon with a “+” sign to import videos.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-4.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>Or, click on the “File” button on the top menu to import files and drag and drop both clips to the same timeline.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are two clips on the timeline. The first clip is called “Cherry Blossom,” and the second clip’s name is “Plating Food.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-5.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Keep Video Clips on the Same Timeline</strong></p>
<p>There shouldn’t be any gap or spaces between the two clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-6.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>It is because gaps will create a dark blank space between the clips when you export the clips, like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-7.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>Therefore, slide the second video right next to the first video without leaving any gaps with your mouse.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-8.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>And guess what? You have already merged the two clips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save Video on Your PC</strong></p>
<p>Now, hit the “Export” button and save the merged video on your computer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Now, without any more delay, let’s start learning how to combine videos in Filmora through the following steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Install Filmora on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>Just visit <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download the latest version of the software for your Windows or MAC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-2.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>After downloading the software on your computer, install it. Once the software is ready, double-click the “Wondershare Filmora” icon (it should be on your desktop screen) to open the program.</p>
<p>As you can see, the interface is simple with user-friendly options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-3.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Multiple Videos in Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Click on the blue icon with a “+” sign to import videos.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-4.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>Or, click on the “File” button on the top menu to import files and drag and drop both clips to the same timeline.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are two clips on the timeline. The first clip is called “Cherry Blossom,” and the second clip’s name is “Plating Food.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-5.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Keep Video Clips on the Same Timeline</strong></p>
<p>There shouldn’t be any gap or spaces between the two clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-6.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>It is because gaps will create a dark blank space between the clips when you export the clips, like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-7.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>Therefore, slide the second video right next to the first video without leaving any gaps with your mouse.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-8.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>And guess what? You have already merged the two clips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save Video on Your PC</strong></p>
<p>Now, hit the “Export” button and save the merged video on your computer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-9.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>HandBrake is an outstanding tool for video conversion, but there’s no benefit of learning <strong>how to merge videos in HandBrake</strong>, as the software does not include such features. Nevertheless, when it is about combining multiple videos in high quality, you can rely on Filmora to merge clips in no time.</p>

<p>Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio&#x2F;video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.</p>
<p>Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone’s interest.</p>
<p>Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.</p>
<p>Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.</p>
<p>Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.</p>
<p>There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p>Yes! That’s correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don’t require credit card information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.</p>
<p>So, let’s simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.</p>

<p>Resemble.ai operates in a variety of ways. It can not only help you make a speech out of the text, but it can also generate text for adverts with a single click. The platform can also produce a personalized voice that you can use as a voice assistant for Alexa, Google, and other services. The technique can also be used by call centres to clone their agents’ voices and customize them.</p>
<p>Resemble gives you four alternative ways to create synthetic voices. You can use the API to generate voices, record up to 50 samples immediately on the online platform, choose from a large number of voice actors, or submit raw audio without a script.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li>The software allows you to Customize your brand’s tone.</li>
<li>It creates responsive IVR agents.</li>
<li>Possible to do Advertisement text generation with AI with one click.</li>
<li>Allows Instant language translation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>The user interface could be enhanced.</li>
<li>- More voices are required; the current ones are far from what I (or others) require.</li>
</ul>
<p>Price</p>
<p>The cheapest package is $30 per month.</p>
<p>For a personalized plan, contact a Resemble representative.</p>

<p>Lovo.ai’s user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.</p>
<p>In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.</li>
<li>A large voice library is available.</li>
<li>Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.</li>
<li>Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.</li>
<li>Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>While the UI&#x2F;UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull.”</li>
<li>The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available.”</li>
<li>I don’t like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).</p>
<p>$34.99 per month for personal</p>
<p>$99.99 per month for Freelancer</p>
<p>The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform’s features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.</p>
<p>You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.</p>

<p>Synthesia is the fourth stage cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval</p>
<p>Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It’s a video maker that also has an AI presenter.</p>
<p>This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Video with AI Presenter — Once you’ve chosen your avatar, all you have to do now is fill in your script. Synthesia allows you to make videos up to 2.5 hours long.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From text to video For the first time, turn plain words into a professional-looking video.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are more than 60 languages available. We now support over 60 distinct languages.</p>

<p>Pricing</p>

<p>$30 per month for personal use (monthly billing)</p>
<p>Enterprise – Individualized Pricing</p>
<p>However, you must pay for add-ons if you want the following features.</p>
<p>Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.</p>
<p>The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.</p>
<p>Assume you’ve exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.</p>
<p>This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Only video producers can use it. If you’re a podcaster, you’ll be disappointed with the tool.</li>
<li>Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4.Murf.ai ( Supports Web, Mobile)</strong></p>
<p><img

                      alt="voice-generators-"
                ></p>
<p>Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.</p>
<p>It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.</p>
<p>Pricing</p>
<ul>
<li>Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).</li>
<li>Monthly Basic – $13</li>
<li>-$26 per month for Pro</li>
<li>Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.</p>
<p>For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you’re a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.</p>
<p>Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5.Play.ht</strong></p>

                      alt="voice-generators-"
                ></p>
<p>Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use. It has a text box on the home page where you may input your text, choose the language, gender, and voice style, and choose the conversion speed.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).</p>
<p>$14.25 per month for personal use</p>
<p>$29.25 per month for professionals</p>
<p>$74.25 per month in Growth</p>
<p>$149.25 per month for business</p>
<p>Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.</p>
<p>All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).</p>
<p>Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.</li>
<li>There isn’t a built-in video editor for adding voiceovers to videos.</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Clipchamp</strong></li>

<p>Clipchamp is a powerful text to speech generator that uses artificial intelligence to convert words into voiceovers for everything from professional videos to advertisements. In a matter of seconds, it can convert an imported script into speech.</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 170 distinct voices</li>

</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Clipchamp is available for a monthly fee of $6.0. Clipchamp offers three different subscription plans:</p>

<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>As you can see, there are numerous free voiceover generators available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p><img

<p>Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio&#x2F;video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.</p>
<p>Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone’s interest.</p>
<p>Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.</p>
<p>Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.</p>
<p>Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.</p>
<p>There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p>Yes! That’s correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don’t require credit card information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.</p>
<p>So, let’s simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.</p>

The platform can also produce a personalized voice that you can use as a voice assistant for Alexa, Google, and other services. The technique can also be used by call centres to clone their agents’ voices and customize them.</p>
<p>Resemble gives you four alternative ways to create synthetic voices. You can use the API to generate voices, record up to 50 samples immediately on the online platform, choose from a large number of voice actors, or submit raw audio without a script.</p>

<p>Lovo.ai’s user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.</p>
<p>In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.</li>
<li>A large voice library is available.</li>
<li>Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.</li>
<li>Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.</li>
<li>Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>While the UI&#x2F;UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull.”</li>
<li>The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available.”</li>
<li>I don’t like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).</p>
<p>$34.99 per month for personal</p>
<p>$99.99 per month for Freelancer</p>
<p>The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform’s features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.</p>
<p>You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.</p>

<p>Synthesia is the fourth stage cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval</p>
<p>Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It’s a video maker that also has an AI presenter.</p>
<p>This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Video with AI Presenter — Once you’ve chosen your avatar, all you have to do now is fill in your script. Synthesia allows you to make videos up to 2.5 hours long.</p>

<p>However, you must pay for add-ons if you want the following features.</p>
<p>Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.</p>
<p>The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.</p>
<p>Assume you’ve exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.</p>
<p>This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Only video producers can use it. If you’re a podcaster, you’ll be disappointed with the tool.</li>
<li>Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.</li>

<p>Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.</p>
<p>It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.</p>
<p>Pricing</p>
<ul>
<li>Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).</li>
<li>Monthly Basic – $13</li>
<li>-$26 per month for Pro</li>
<li>Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.</p>
<p>For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you’re a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.</p>
<p>Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.</li>

                ></p>
<p>Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use. It has a text box on the home page where you may input your text, choose the language, gender, and voice style, and choose the conversion speed.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).</p>
<p>$14.25 per month for personal use</p>
<p>$29.25 per month for professionals</p>
<p>$74.25 per month in Growth</p>
<p>$149.25 per month for business</p>
<p>Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.</p>
<p>All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).</p>
<p>Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.</li>
<li>There isn’t a built-in video editor for adding voiceovers to videos.</li>

<p>Clipchamp is a powerful text to speech generator that uses artificial intelligence to convert words into voiceovers for everything from professional videos to advertisements. In a matter of seconds, it can convert an imported script into speech.</p>

<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>As you can see, there are numerous free voiceover generators available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p><img

<p>Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio&#x2F;video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.</p>
<p>Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone’s interest.</p>
<p>Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.</p>
<p>Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.</p>
<p>Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.</p>
<p>There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p>Yes! That’s correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don’t require credit card information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.</p>
<p>So, let’s simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.</p>

The platform can also produce a personalized voice that you can use as a voice assistant for Alexa, Google, and other services. The technique can also be used by call centres to clone their agents’ voices and customize them.</p>
<p>Resemble gives you four alternative ways to create synthetic voices. You can use the API to generate voices, record up to 50 samples immediately on the online platform, choose from a large number of voice actors, or submit raw audio without a script.</p>

<p>Lovo.ai’s user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.</p>
<p>In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.</li>
<li>A large voice library is available.</li>
<li>Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.</li>
<li>Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.</li>
<li>Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>While the UI&#x2F;UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull.”</li>
<li>The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available.”</li>
<li>I don’t like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).</p>
<p>$34.99 per month for personal</p>
<p>$99.99 per month for Freelancer</p>
<p>The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform’s features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.</p>
<p>You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.</p>

<p>Synthesia is the fourth stage cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval</p>
<p>Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It’s a video maker that also has an AI presenter.</p>
<p>This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Video with AI Presenter — Once you’ve chosen your avatar, all you have to do now is fill in your script. Synthesia allows you to make videos up to 2.5 hours long.</p>

<p>Enterprise – Individualized Pricing</p>
<p>However, you must pay for add-ons if you want the following features.</p>
<p>Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.</p>
<p>The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.</p>
<p>Assume you’ve exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.</p>
<p>This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Only video producers can use it. If you’re a podcaster, you’ll be disappointed with the tool.</li>
<li>Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.</li>

<p><strong>4.Murf.ai ( Supports Web, Mobile)</strong></p>

<p>Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.</p>
<p>It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.</p>
<p>Pricing</p>
<ul>
<li>Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).</li>
<li>Monthly Basic – $13</li>
<li>-$26 per month for Pro</li>
<li>Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.</p>
<p>For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you’re a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.</p>
<p>Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.</li>

                ></p>
<p>Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use. It has a text box on the home page where you may input your text, choose the language, gender, and voice style, and choose the conversion speed.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).</p>
<p>$14.25 per month for personal use</p>
<p>$29.25 per month for professionals</p>
<p>$74.25 per month in Growth</p>
<p>$149.25 per month for business</p>
<p>Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.</p>
<p>All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).</p>
<p>Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.</p>
<p>Cons</p>

<li>Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.</li>

<p>Clipchamp is a powerful text to speech generator that uses artificial intelligence to convert words into voiceovers for everything from professional videos to advertisements. In a matter of seconds, it can convert an imported script into speech.</p>
<p>Because of its simplicity, Clipchamp is another excellent choice for beginners. To generate a preview, simply select your voice, language, and speed before uploading a script. The AI technology in the tool analyzes the script to identify areas that need to be changed.</p>

<p>Because voice modulation features allow you to play voice recordings backwards or change your voice to sound robotic or even alien, this Android-based app is designed to be enjoyable and easy to use.

<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>As you can see, there are numerous free voiceover generators available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>

<p>Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio&#x2F;video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.</p>
<p>Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone’s interest.</p>
<p>Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.</p>
<p>Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.</p>
<p>Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.</p>
<p>There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p>Yes! That’s correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don’t require credit card information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.</p>
<p>So, let’s simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.</p>

The platform can also produce a personalized voice that you can use as a voice assistant for Alexa, Google, and other services. The technique can also be used by call centres to clone their agents’ voices and customize them.</p>
<p>Resemble gives you four alternative ways to create synthetic voices. You can use the API to generate voices, record up to 50 samples immediately on the online platform, choose from a large number of voice actors, or submit raw audio without a script.</p>
<p>Features</p>

<p>Lovo.ai’s user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.</p>
<p>In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.</li>
<li>A large voice library is available.</li>
<li>Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.</li>
<li>Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.</li>
<li>Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>While the UI&#x2F;UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull.”</li>
<li>The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available.”</li>
<li>I don’t like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).</p>
<p>$34.99 per month for personal</p>
<p>$99.99 per month for Freelancer</p>
<p>The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform’s features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.</p>
<p>You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.</p>

<p>Synthesia is the fourth stage cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval</p>
<p>Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It’s a video maker that also has an AI presenter.</p>
<p>This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Video with AI Presenter — Once you’ve chosen your avatar, all you have to do now is fill in your script. Synthesia allows you to make videos up to 2.5 hours long.</p>

<p>Enterprise – Individualized Pricing</p>
<p>However, you must pay for add-ons if you want the following features.</p>
<p>Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.</p>
<p>The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.</p>
<p>Assume you’ve exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.</p>
<p>This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Only video producers can use it. If you’re a podcaster, you’ll be disappointed with the tool.</li>
<li>Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.</li>

<p><strong>4.Murf.ai ( Supports Web, Mobile)</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p>Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.</p>
<p>It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.</p>
<p>Pricing</p>
<ul>
<li>Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).</li>
<li>Monthly Basic – $13</li>
<li>-$26 per month for Pro</li>
<li>Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.</p>
<p>For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you’re a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.</p>
<p>Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.</li>

                ></p>
<p>Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use. It has a text box on the home page where you may input your text, choose the language, gender, and voice style, and choose the conversion speed.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).</p>
<p>$14.25 per month for personal use</p>
<p>$29.25 per month for professionals</p>
<p>$74.25 per month in Growth</p>
<p>$149.25 per month for business</p>
<p>Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.</p>
<p>All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).</p>
<p>Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.</li>
<li>There isn’t a built-in video editor for adding voiceovers to videos.</li>

<p>Clipchamp is a powerful text to speech generator that uses artificial intelligence to convert words into voiceovers for everything from professional videos to advertisements. In a matter of seconds, it can convert an imported script into speech.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Edit-Recorded-Video"><a href="#How-to-Edit-Recorded-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit Recorded Video"></a>How to Edit Recorded Video</h2><p>The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don’t need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.</p>
<p>Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you’re on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don’t have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we’ve put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you’ll need to know to make stunning films, even if you’ve never done it before. We’ll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS"></a><strong>Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS</strong></h2><p>OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It’s open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Download and Install OBS</strong></p>
<p>Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Setup Screen Recording</strong></p>
<p>The window is divided into separate parts called “docks” when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you’ll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="obs setup screen recording"
                ></p>
<p>You’ll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Customize the Recording Source</strong></p>
<p>You’ll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select “Display Capture” by clicking the “+” icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click “OK”. At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you’re ready to begin recording. When you’re finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.</p>

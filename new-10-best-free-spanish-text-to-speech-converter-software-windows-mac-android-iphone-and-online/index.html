Depending on the tool you use, the process of adding text to a video can be simple or complicated.</p>
<p>In this article, we will share with you the different options you have when you want to add text elements to a video project.</p>
<h2 id="Add-Text-to-a-Video-Online"><a href="#Add-Text-to-a-Video-Online" class="headerlink" title="Add Text to a Video Online"></a>Add Text to a Video Online</h2><p>One of the easiest ways that you can add text to any video is to use a free online solution. There are many online tools to choose from but VEED is a free solution that is easy to use and offers a wide range of features to choose from.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can use VEED to add text to your video;</p>
<p>Step1Go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.veed.io/" >https://www.veed.io/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on any browser to access the video editing tool. Click on “Upload Your Video” to open a new project. In the new project screen that appears, tap on “Upload a file” to add your video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="upload video to veedio"
                ></p>
<p>Step2Once the video is open, click on the “Text” tab on the left and then select the type of text you want to add to the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add text veedio"
                ></p>
<p>Step3Type in your text and then use the options below the text box to choose the font style, size, and color of the text. You can also use the duration icons below the text to indicate where you want the text to appear during playback.</p>
<p><img

<p>Wondershare Filmora always offers to split the clips from the creative techniques. This tool is extremely useful, particularly when creating commentaries, tutorials, or interviews. The exact footage has to be on the timeline. All the options are on the main panel. Add anything you like, such as animation, text, images, or other media, to make an outstanding outcome. These are very easy to understand, so go through the following steps for splitting the video clips. Two ways are trimming and splitting the clips in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><strong>First method: splitting on the timeline</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Selection of the clip in the timeline that you want to split. Your play head should be precisely at this particular place from where you need the splitting.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="split a clip in lightworks "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> When your play head is on the correct point of the timeline, right-click on the clip for opening the menu. Select the option of “Split” or click on the scissor icon in red colour.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="split a clip in lightworks "
                ></p>
<p>There is also a possibility of hiding the red icon of the scissor present. You can do it by tapping on the options of Wondershare Filmora. Then go to Preferencesàediting. Now uncheck the button of <strong>Split.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="split a clip in lightworks "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Second method: detection of the scene</strong></p>
<p>If there are different shots in your clips or separation in the scenes, you can use the tool of “scene detection” in the Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Select your video clip from the media library that you want to split. After right-clicking on it, select the option of “Scene detection” from the menu.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="split a clip in lightworks "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> The new window of the scene detection appears and then click on “Detect”. Depending on the transitions of the video clips, it is divided into different parts.</p>

It is just because of its simplicity and advanced tools that fulfil the users’ needs. The whole interface is hassle-free and clean no matter which operating system you use. It is also helpful in saving your time in terms of applying the settings of colour correction on more than one clip at all at once.</p>

                      alt="split a clip in lightworks "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After getting the split clip, you can delete the remaining part that is not in use. For this, selecting the particular part is necessary and selecting the option of “Delete”. Even, you can press the “delete” key on your keyboard.</p>

These are very easy to understand, so go through the following steps for splitting the video clips. Two ways are trimming and splitting the clips in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><strong>First method: splitting on the timeline</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Selection of the clip in the timeline that you want to split. Your play head should be precisely at this particular place from where you need the splitting.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/split-a-clip-in-lightworks-8.jpeg"
                      alt="split a clip in lightworks "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> When your play head is on the correct point of the timeline, right-click on the clip for opening the menu. Select the option of “Split” or click on the scissor icon in red colour.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/split-a-clip-in-lightworks-9.jpeg"
                      alt="split a clip in lightworks "
                ></p>
<p>There is also a possibility of hiding the red icon of the scissor present. You can do it by tapping on the options of Wondershare Filmora. Then go to Preferencesàediting. Now uncheck the button of <strong>Split.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/split-a-clip-in-lightworks-10.png"
                      alt="split a clip in lightworks "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Second method: detection of the scene</strong></p>
<p>If there are different shots in your clips or separation in the scenes, you can use the tool of “scene detection” in the Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Select your video clip from the media library that you want to split. After right-clicking on it, select the option of “Scene detection” from the menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/split-a-clip-in-lightworks-11.jpeg"
                      alt="split a clip in lightworks "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> The new window of the scene detection appears and then click on “Detect”. Depending on the transitions of the video clips, it is divided into different parts.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

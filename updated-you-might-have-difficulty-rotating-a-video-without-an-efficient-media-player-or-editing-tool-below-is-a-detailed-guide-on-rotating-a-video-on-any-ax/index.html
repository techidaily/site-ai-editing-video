Below Is a Detailed Guide on Rotating a Video on Any Axes</h2><p>The Internet and social media have become a staple in our daily lives. Internet users post thousands of videos every day that you can watch online or download and rewatch in your free time. Suppose you encounter a video that is upside down or shot at an angle that makes it difficult for you to enjoy it fully.</p>
<p>It would be nice to find a way to rotate the video to portrait mode so you can watch it without any distractions. Fortunately, this article will discuss using Media Player Classic to rotate any video. We also discuss an excellent alternative to the aforementioned media player.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Media-Player-Classic"><a href="#What-Is-Media-Player-Classic" class="headerlink" title="What Is Media Player Classic?"></a>What Is Media Player Classic?</h2><p>In a nutshell, Media Player Classic is an open-source media player suitable for 32-bit and 64-bit Microsoft Windows. If you have used the original interface, you might notice that it resembles Windows Media Player 6.4. The only key difference is that the former is more feature-rich and provides more options. In addition, Media Player Classic is very compact and lightweight.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="media player classic interface"
                ></p>
<p>A programmer named “Gabest’’ created and designed this platform as a closed-source application. Things changed, and he later relicensed the media player as free under the terms of the GLP-2.0 license. He released the final version, MPC 6.4.9.0, on 20th March 2006.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, development stalled in 2006, much to the disappointment of many users who had grown to love it. Gabest made a public statement in 2007 saying that Media Player Classic was not dead, just that he couldn’t work on it anymore.</p>
<h2 id="How-To-Rotate-Video-in-Media-Player-Classic"><a href="#How-To-Rotate-Video-in-Media-Player-Classic" class="headerlink" title="How To Rotate Video in Media Player Classic?"></a>How To Rotate Video in Media Player Classic?</h2><p>Media Player Classic allows you to rotate your video around three axes, X, Y, and Z. Once you are done, you can fix a video that was initially upside down or in landscape mode for a better viewing experience. Another perk of using Media Player Classic to rotate a video is that you can use shortcuts to make your work easier.</p>
<p>Before we teach you how to rotate video in windows Media Player Classic, there are a few things you should know. Unfortunately, this platform doesn’t allow you to rotate a video in its graphical user interface. You can’t also use it to edit a video. Suppose you want to add text or overwrite the original video clip. Media Player Classic can only allow you to playback a video or rotate it.</p>
<p>Here is a simple guide on how to rotate videos in Media Player Classic.</p>
<p>Step1 Launch Media Player Classic and click on the “View” tab. Select “Options” or click “O” to display the “Options” window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-player-classic-options.jpg"
                      alt="options in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Navigate to the left pane to the Player Group and click on “Keys.” If the Player Group is not expanded by the time, you launch the platform, double-click it and wait a few seconds. You can then navigate to the “PnS Rotate” command on the Keys list.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-player-classic-keys.jpg"
                      alt="keys in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Go to the “PnS Rotate+” command and double-click the “Key” field. You can then click on any key to rotate your video around the x-axis. Once you are satisfied with the results, click “…” to apply the changes you have made.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-player-classic-pns-rotate.jpg"
                      alt="pns rotate in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 You can now assign shortcuts to “PnS Rotate” commands. For instance, you could assign PnS Rotate Y for rotation along the Y axis and PnS Z for rotation along the Z axis. After each axis has a shortcut, select “Apply” then “OK” to save your changes and close the Options window respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-player-classic-apply.jpg"
                      alt="apply rotate in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Select “Output” on the Options window and navigate to the DirectShow Video section to confirm whether the Media Classic Player supports rotation for the rendered video. Ascertain the Rotation feature has a green check mark, which indicates that the platform promotes rotation for the video. If the video has a red X, select “Apply” and click “OK.”</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="output rotation in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Use the shortcuts you assigned to the keys in Step 4 to rotate your video as you see fit. Since the rotation occurs gradually, you might need to press the keys numerous times or press and hold to see a visible change.</p>
<p>For instance, you can rotate your video from landscape to portrait by clicking “Alt-Num 1” and “Alt-Num 3,” respectively. To revert your video to its original state, press “Alt-Num 5.”</p>

<p>As you have seen, Media player Classic doesn’t have the Rotate feature per se. However, you can assign shortcuts to the keys to rotate a video along three axes as you see fit. You can also use a combination of keys like Alt and Num to change how your video sits so you can enjoy it as you like.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Wondershare Filmora has a more comprehensive Rotate feature that allows you to drag your pointer along a bar till the video sits at the correct number of degrees.</p>
<p>This platform also provides additional features, like allowing you to scale the video to fit the screen and adjusting project settings like the resolution and frame rate. If you don’t want to use the sliding bar, you can use your pointer to manually adjust the rotation by clicking on the pivot with your pointer.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Windows Media Player is the ideal choice if you want to rotate your video and leave it at that. However, if you are looking for more advanced features, you are better off choosing Wondershare Filmora. The latter option also makes your videos look more polished like they were edited by a professional.</p>

The colors do not appear bright and robust on a screen as in real life.</p>
<p>While there are numerous reasons for the dull, uninviting look- a basic edit could fix it quickly. One of the vital, if not the first, steps in the process is color grading and color correction. However, what exactly are color grading and color correction? And how can they help fix the color ratios and balance in a video?</p>
<p>This article covers everything you need to know about color grading and correction and a complete guide to adjusting cinematic colors with the best video editor, Wondershare Filmora. So, without much ado, let’s dig into it!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Color-Grading-VS-Color-Correction"><a href="#Part-1-Color-Grading-VS-Color-Correction" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Color Grading VS Color Correction"></a>Part 1. Color Grading VS Color Correction</h2><p>These terms have often been used interchangeably; people consider them synonymous. However, they are two different artistic phenomena to adjust the color scheme.</p>
<p>Since we will discuss them in detail later, here is a brief description. Put simply, color correcting is a corrective procedure, while color grading is a cinematic adjustment.</p>
<p>Color correction diverts the colors to a relatively neutral baseline achieving a unified look for all captured shots. On the other hand, color grading is inclined more toward a creative look aimed at balancing colors that reflect the emotion of the sequence.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="color correction vs color grading"
                ></p>
<p>These two work hand in hand to dramatically uplift the overall look of the sequence. Let’s delve deeper into these techniques and see how to use them.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-Color-Correction"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-Color-Correction" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What Is Color Correction?"></a>Part 2. What Is Color Correction?</h2><p>We will start with color correction- the first step in color editing. Even with a slight glance at the raw shots, you can notice how much the tones are messed up. The crude product is oversaturated with colors.</p>
<p>Color correction is about making the shots look as natural as possible. It brings the sequences to the neutral baseline to achieve a unified look.</p>
<p>For now, we need to ignore our creative and aesthetic preferences and focus entirely on exposure and white balance. The actual end goal is to keep the colors true to life.</p>
<p>However, color-correcting a video is challenging if you are a beginner. There needs to be more than just understanding the fundamentals; it requires cinematic and technical skills.</p>
<p>Here is the basic process for a clean, color-corrected shot, irrespective of the software you use.</p>
<h3 id="Essential-Steps-for-Color-Correcting-a-Shot"><a href="#Essential-Steps-for-Color-Correcting-a-Shot" class="headerlink" title="Essential Steps for Color Correcting a Shot"></a>Essential Steps for Color Correcting a Shot</h3><h5 id="1-Set-the-color-profile"><a href="#1-Set-the-color-profile" class="headerlink" title="1. Set the color profile"></a>1. Set the color profile</h5><p>Different video formats (HDR, LOG, RAW, HLG, etc.) have different exposure content. Therefore, select a color profile that matches your video format for the best results before starting.</p>
<h5 id="2-Adjust-the-saturation"><a href="#2-Adjust-the-saturation" class="headerlink" title="2. Adjust the saturation"></a>2. Adjust the saturation</h5><p>It is the primary step of color correction. Often the exposure of raw content is high. Next, equalize the saturation for a natural look.</p>
<h5 id="3-Fix-the-contrast"><a href="#3-Fix-the-contrast" class="headerlink" title="3. Fix the contrast"></a>3. Fix the contrast</h5><p>Contrast is the difference between the light and dark areas of the image. Pictures with a higher contrast are sharper and more detailed.</p>
<p>However, adjust the contrast during color correcting so that the dark areas are not crushed, and you preserve the details maximally.</p>
<h5 id="4-Set-the-white-balance"><a href="#4-Set-the-white-balance" class="headerlink" title="4. Set the white balance"></a>4. Set the white balance</h5><p>It is time to adjust the white balance with the saturation and contrast fixed. The colors will shift to orange and blue hues if it is maladjusted.</p>
<p>Use the color curves to ensure pure whites so all colors fall correctly in place.</p>
<h5 id="5-Double-check-individual-color-tones"><a href="#5-Double-check-individual-color-tones" class="headerlink" title="5. Double-check individual color tones"></a>5. Double-check individual color tones</h5><p>The final step is a secondary checking of the individual colors. Double-check the skin tones so they match in each shot.</p>
<p>Make sure the skin tones match their natural hues for an authentic, unfiltered look.</p>
<p>It is a basic walkthrough for color-correcting. More steps can vary according to the professional demands of the video. However, as a beginner, this is the best process to follow.</p>
<p>Once we’ve corrected the color, it is time to move to the next and primary step- color grading.</p>

What Is Color Grading?</h2><p>After you set all the tones to the baseline, you can start with the creative process of color grading. In this case, you do not change the colors anymore. Instead, you make artistic choices to change the moods and emotions of that particular sequence. Color grading is about manipulating the colors and contrasts that intensify the visual tone and explain your story to the world.</p>
<p>Color correction can be enough if you want to keep the video realistic. However, color grading is essential if you want to imply emotions and feelings in your content. Following is an essential step-by-step guide to color grading.</p>
<h3 id="Basic-Steps-of-Color-Grading"><a href="#Basic-Steps-of-Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="Basic Steps of Color Grading"></a>Basic Steps of Color Grading</h3><p>If you are a beginner, the color grading process can be tricky without expertise. Hence here are the basic steps of color grading a video.</p>
<h5 id="1-Color-correcting"><a href="#1-Color-correcting" class="headerlink" title="1. Color correcting"></a>1. Color correcting</h5><p>Correcting the colors and balance will always be the first step before you can color-grade footage. Next, the video must be normalized and should seem natural before you intensify the overall look.</p>
<h5 id="2-Match-the-colors"><a href="#2-Match-the-colors" class="headerlink" title="2. Match the colors"></a>2. Match the colors</h5><p>In the next step, we balance the contours between color-corrected footage and color grading. Then, you can use LUTs (Look Up Tables) to match the individual colors to the scheme.</p>
<h5 id="3-Shot-to-shot-matching"><a href="#3-Shot-to-shot-matching" class="headerlink" title="3. Shot-to-shot matching"></a>3. Shot-to-shot matching</h5><p>The next integral step is to match the colors between all the shots so we can achieve a unified look. The contrasting appearance of shots can make them look unprofessional and poorly cinematic.</p>
<h5 id="4-Adjust-the-mood-and-emotions"><a href="#4-Adjust-the-mood-and-emotions" class="headerlink" title="4. Adjust the mood and emotions"></a>4. Adjust the mood and emotions</h5><p>A well-executed color grading can potentiate the emotions in a shot. Use your artistic choices and tools from editing software to imply the director’s feelings in the video.</p>
<h5 id="5-Make-the-final-adjustments"><a href="#5-Make-the-final-adjustments" class="headerlink" title="5. Make the final adjustments"></a>5. Make the final adjustments</h5><p>As the final opportunity, tweak hues and chroma to ensure the colors match your palette in each scene. But, again, do not overdo anything, and play with colors to nudge the moods in the shot.</p>
<p>If your footage is the cake, color grading is the cherry on top that enhances the final look. You can instantly evoke connotations and bring the audience to a different page with some professional color grading.</p>
<p>However, while color correcting and grading, there are a few things that you should take care of. Here is a list of some To-do’s and Not To-do’s in the post-production edit.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Things-To-Consider-About-the-Editing-Environment"><a href="#Part-4-Things-To-Consider-About-the-Editing-Environment" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Things To Consider About the Editing Environment"></a>Part 4. Things To Consider About the Editing Environment</h2><p>Before you begin color-grading or color-correcting, here are some essential things to consider that can dramatically improve the results.</p>
<h5 id="1-Neutral-editing-environment"><a href="#1-Neutral-editing-environment" class="headerlink" title="1. Neutral editing environment"></a>1. Neutral editing environment</h5><p>Funky neon lights or fluorescent lights in the background can dominate your vision. As compensation, you will be over-saturating your footage with colors.</p>
<p>Make sure to use only white, neutral light with a CRI (color rendering Index) of at least 90. It will decrease inconsistencies as much as possible.</p>
<h5 id="2-Using-might-shifts-orange-screen"><a href="#2-Using-might-shifts-orange-screen" class="headerlink" title="2. Using might shifts&#x2F;orange screen"></a>2. Using might shifts&#x2F;orange screen</h5><p>People often activate night shifts or orange screens to protect their eyes from excessive strain. Resultantly, the screen appears dull and orange-y.</p>
<p>Since this alters the actual colors of the video, the results are undermined. So make sure to turn off all technologies that can sabotage the grading.</p>
<h5 id="3-Control-the-light"><a href="#3-Control-the-light" class="headerlink" title="3. Control the light"></a>3. Control the light</h5><p>It is necessary to control the amount of light that enters your working space area. Excessive light alters your color perception and hence obstructs achieving a balanced contour.</p>
<p>Ensure that the light does not directly falls on the screen or your eyes. You must maintain an adequate distance from the screen to see nuances as you grade.</p>
<p>After completing all the fundamentals of color correcting and color grading, let’s demonstrate how to do it in real-time.</p>
<p>Choosing good software can be chaos.

<h2 id="Part-3-What-Is-Color-Grading-1"><a href="#Part-3-What-Is-Color-Grading-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What Is Color Grading?"></a>Part 3. What Is Color Grading?</h2><p>After you set all the tones to the baseline, you can start with the creative process of color grading. In this case, you do not change the colors anymore. Instead, you make artistic choices to change the moods and emotions of that particular sequence. Color grading is about manipulating the colors and contrasts that intensify the visual tone and explain your story to the world.</p>
<p>Color correction can be enough if you want to keep the video realistic. However, color grading is essential if you want to imply emotions and feelings in your content. Following is an essential step-by-step guide to color grading.</p>
<h3 id="Basic-Steps-of-Color-Grading-1"><a href="#Basic-Steps-of-Color-Grading-1" class="headerlink" title="Basic Steps of Color Grading"></a>Basic Steps of Color Grading</h3><p>If you are a beginner, the color grading process can be tricky without expertise. Hence here are the basic steps of color grading a video.</p>
<h5 id="1-Color-correcting-1"><a href="#1-Color-correcting-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Color correcting"></a>1. Color correcting</h5><p>Correcting the colors and balance will always be the first step before you can color-grade footage. Next, the video must be normalized and should seem natural before you intensify the overall look.</p>
<h5 id="2-Match-the-colors-1"><a href="#2-Match-the-colors-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Match the colors"></a>2. Match the colors</h5><p>In the next step, we balance the contours between color-corrected footage and color grading. Then, you can use LUTs (Look Up Tables) to match the individual colors to the scheme.</p>
<h5 id="3-Shot-to-shot-matching-1"><a href="#3-Shot-to-shot-matching-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Shot-to-shot matching"></a>3. Shot-to-shot matching</h5><p>The next integral step is to match the colors between all the shots so we can achieve a unified look. The contrasting appearance of shots can make them look unprofessional and poorly cinematic.</p>
<h5 id="4-Adjust-the-mood-and-emotions-1"><a href="#4-Adjust-the-mood-and-emotions-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Adjust the mood and emotions"></a>4. Adjust the mood and emotions</h5><p>A well-executed color grading can potentiate the emotions in a shot. Use your artistic choices and tools from editing software to imply the director’s feelings in the video.</p>
<h5 id="5-Make-the-final-adjustments-1"><a href="#5-Make-the-final-adjustments-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Make the final adjustments"></a>5. Make the final adjustments</h5><p>As the final opportunity, tweak hues and chroma to ensure the colors match your palette in each scene. But, again, do not overdo anything, and play with colors to nudge the moods in the shot.</p>
<p>If your footage is the cake, color grading is the cherry on top that enhances the final look. You can instantly evoke connotations and bring the audience to a different page with some professional color grading.</p>
<p>However, while color correcting and grading, there are a few things that you should take care of. Here is a list of some To-do’s and Not To-do’s in the post-production edit.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Things-To-Consider-About-the-Editing-Environment-1"><a href="#Part-4-Things-To-Consider-About-the-Editing-Environment-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Things To Consider About the Editing Environment"></a>Part 4. Things To Consider About the Editing Environment</h2><p>Before you begin color-grading or color-correcting, here are some essential things to consider that can dramatically improve the results.</p>
<h5 id="1-Neutral-editing-environment-1"><a href="#1-Neutral-editing-environment-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Neutral editing environment"></a>1. Neutral editing environment</h5><p>Funky neon lights or fluorescent lights in the background can dominate your vision. As compensation, you will be over-saturating your footage with colors.</p>
<p>Make sure to use only white, neutral light with a CRI (color rendering Index) of at least 90. It will decrease inconsistencies as much as possible.</p>
<h5 id="2-Using-might-shifts-orange-screen-1"><a href="#2-Using-might-shifts-orange-screen-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Using might shifts&#x2F;orange screen"></a>2. Using might shifts&#x2F;orange screen</h5><p>People often activate night shifts or orange screens to protect their eyes from excessive strain. Resultantly, the screen appears dull and orange-y.</p>
<p>Since this alters the actual colors of the video, the results are undermined. So make sure to turn off all technologies that can sabotage the grading.</p>
<h5 id="3-Control-the-light-1"><a href="#3-Control-the-light-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Control the light"></a>3. Control the light</h5><p>It is necessary to control the amount of light that enters your working space area. Excessive light alters your color perception and hence obstructs achieving a balanced contour.</p>
<p>Ensure that the light does not directly falls on the screen or your eyes. You must maintain an adequate distance from the screen to see nuances as you grade.</p>
<p>After completing all the fundamentals of color correcting and color grading, let’s demonstrate how to do it in real-time.</p>
<p>Choosing good software can be chaos.

It is an obvious fact that given a choice to voice out or type, the former would bag in a considerably higher number of votes.</p>
<p>Having a technology backup, it is now practically possible to convert your voice commands into text with utmost ease, thanks to the advent of reliable speech to text applications. The utility works to transform the words you speak, into an exact text representation, thus saving both, your time and energy. Such applications work on the principle of responding to speech recognition requests and processing the same to render an equitable text output.</p>

Post that, all you need to do is, activate the service and adhere to the following user guide to start converting texts into audio with the program:</p>
<h3 id="02User’s-Guide-for-Converting-Text-to-Speech-in-Panopreter-3"><a href="#02User’s-Guide-for-Converting-Text-to-Speech-in-Panopreter-3" class="headerlink" title="02User’s Guide for Converting Text to Speech in Panopreter"></a>02User’s Guide for Converting Text to Speech in Panopreter</h3><p><strong>Step 1: Download the Converter Program</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the official Panopreter website and download the software to your system. Once then download gets completed, proceed to install the same and wait for the program’s welcome screen to appear.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Mode Selection and Setting</strong></p>
<p>As the launch screen pops up, you will be asked to choose the preferred working mode from the ‘Input and Speak’ and ‘Read Batch Files’ alternatives. You should know that the former is the default operation mode of the software and you can activate the same in a few steps.</p>
<p>Start with navigating to the ‘Menu Options’ tab and clicking on the ‘Settings’ option in the latter’s drop down list. The ‘Settings’ dialog box pops up, where you need to hit the ‘Speak Node’ option in the panel at the left. In the ‘Speak Window’ that appears next, click within the checkbox of your desired option and that’s it! The default ‘Input and Speak’ mode will be activated when you re-launch the software.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you desire to work in the ‘Read Batch Files’ mode, navigate to the ‘Menu Bar’ at the top of the software interface and hit the ‘File’ tab. From the list of items that drops down, select the ‘Read Batch Files’ option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Mode Specific Software Operation</strong></p>
<p>If you are working in the ‘Input and Speak’ mode, you can proceed with typing or pasting a desired text within the ‘Text Window’ Another option is to open a desired text document or file directly from your system. As for working in the ‘Read Batch Files’ mode, you are allowed to manage your system’s text files through the ‘Open’, ‘Clear’ and ‘Delete’ buttons. You should however take caution to add all the files in a common language.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Language Selection</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Language List’ window and pick a preferred language to convert the text files into audio transcripts. Remember to choose the same conversion language as added of the ‘Text Window’ files in Step 2, lest you would end up getting an undesirable speech output.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Voice Selection</strong></p>
<p>As you complete Step 4, a series of preset text to speech voice alternatives present within your system for the preferred language will show up in the ‘Voice Window’. Proceed to select the voice type you like.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Read Aloud!</strong></p>
<p>After you have selected the voice, tap the ‘Speak’ button and start reading your text aloud. Amid the process, you will see the ‘Stop’, ‘Resume’ and ‘Pause’ buttons getting enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Save Your Transcription</strong></p>
<p>When you have finished reading the text, click on the ‘Stop’ button to end the transcription process. The ‘Save as Audio’ option gets enabled, allowing you to convert your text into speech in the MP3, OGG, WAV and FLAC file formats.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Customize Your Audio</strong></p>
<p>The Panopreter program lets you add suitable customizations to the transcribed audio to ensure affordable file size and sound quality. You can adjust the bit rate and sample rate to address the aforesaid concern. All you need to do is, head to the ‘Menu Options’ at the top of the app screen and select ‘Settings’.</p>

Don’t worry! We got you covered through this article which will guide you through the different things which you must learn before editing the first draft of your video.</p>
<h3 id="Start-a-video-project"><a href="#Start-a-video-project" class="headerlink" title="Start a video project"></a>Start a video project</h3><p>Your smartphone and digital camera can let you record multiple videos but what now? You head out to edit your first draft by choosing a suitable platform or software and then you can surely lay back and see the software doing wonders to your raw videos. By starting off with editing, you choose your video editing preferences and then you just let the video editing tools do the magic.</p>
<h3 id="Get-to-know-the-video-editing-software-workspace"><a href="#Get-to-know-the-video-editing-software-workspace" class="headerlink" title="Get to know the video editing software workspace"></a>Get to know the video editing software workspace</h3><p>Video editing software offer customizable workspaces for different editing tasks. The software workspace streamlines routine actions you take with clips, like editing clips, making DVD and Blu-ray menus, and sharing movies. By placing panels in the layout that best matches your working style, you can personalize your workspace. The additional panels adjust automatically to fit the window as you rearrange them. For various jobs, such as one for editing and one for preview, you can build and store multiple workspaces.</p>
<h3 id="Understand-the-timeline"><a href="#Understand-the-timeline" class="headerlink" title="Understand the timeline"></a>Understand the timeline</h3><p>The timeline of your video is the backbone of your digital video editing process. It’s called a timeline because the various pieces of video will be lined up horizontally. In a video editing software, the timeline is where you arrange your video clips and plan out all the modifications you want to do. As you work, you will see every single one of your video and audio clips, effects, and transitions sorted chronologically from beginning to end. All the fundamentals of video editing, including reordering, trimming, and enhancing your footage, are available. To preview how your adjustments will turn out, you can also play your project at any point in the timeline.</p>
<h3 id="Add-clips-to-timeline"><a href="#Add-clips-to-timeline" class="headerlink" title="Add clips to timeline"></a>Add clips to timeline</h3><p>When you have grasped the idea behind a timeline, the next step you need to follow is to add clips into your timeline. Before adding clips to your timeline, it is suggested that you label each clip. Although it does seem like a lot of work, it will be easier to locate all of the clips later on if you’re working on a large project. after the footages are gathered and named, add important clips in the beginning of the timeline to begin establishing the video’s overall structure and order.</p>

<ul>
<li>Transform</li>

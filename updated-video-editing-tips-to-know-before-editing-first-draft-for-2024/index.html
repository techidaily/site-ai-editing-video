It has industry-standard color grading tools that work with AI power to enable its users to enhance their video creations. It also is available with voiceover and video overlay features.

<p>And after installing Final Cut Pro if you are overwhelmed by its tons of features, then here are the steps following which you will be able to use Final Cut Pro:</p>
<ul>

<li>Here, you will have to click on the “New project” icon.</li>
<li>It will then ask you to import any media files to the application. Select the video file that you want to edit and it will take some time to import the media file.</li>

<h2 id="How-To-Create-A-Green-Screen-Video-In-After-Effects"><a href="#How-To-Create-A-Green-Screen-Video-In-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="How To Create A Green Screen Video In After Effects"></a>How To Create A Green Screen Video In After Effects</h2><p>You’ll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We’ll demonstrate how to do easily for you.</p>
<p>Let’s start off!</p>
<h2 id="1-Importing-your-footage"><a href="#1-Importing-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="1. Importing your footage"></a>1. Importing your footage</h2><p>After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the “Image Utilities” heading.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-green-screen-video-footage-ae.jpg"
                      alt="import green screen video footage ae"
                ></p>
<h2 id="2-Remove-the-green-color"><a href="#2-Remove-the-green-color" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove the green color"></a>2. Remove the green color</h2><p>After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the “Animation Presets” window, searching for the “Keylight” preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the “Effects Controls” window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen’s background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/remove-green-color-from-video-in-ae.jpg"
                      alt="remove green color from video in ae"
                ></p>
<h2 id="3-Clean-up-the-shot"><a href="#3-Clean-up-the-shot" class="headerlink" title="3. Clean up the shot"></a>3. Clean up the shot</h2><p>You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.</p>
<p>Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg"
                      alt="clean up green screen shot ae"
                ></p>
<p>You can go to the “Screen Matte” area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you’ve applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!</p>

<h2 id="Step-by-Step-to-Add-Border-to-Video-Using-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Step-by-Step-to-Add-Border-to-Video-Using-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Step by Step to Add Border to Video Using Premiere Pro"></a>Step by Step to Add Border to Video Using Premiere Pro</h2><p>The border is really important as it frames up all the video. It makes the video eye-catching and gives a vivid effect. It also fixes the automated cropping issues, especially on Instagram. Along with this, it helps the viewers to watch the video as you can add effects about fun, travel, guides and etc. accordingly. Adding a border is super easy and it’s not more than fun!</p>
<p>So let’s start…</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Add-Borders-to-Videos-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Add-Borders-to-Videos-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Add Borders to Videos in Premiere Pro"></a><strong>How to Add Borders to Videos in Premiere Pro</strong></h2><p>Today we are going to discuss how to add borders to the video clips or images in premiere pro. It’s pretty simple to make borders of different colors and sizes for your video clips.</p>
<p>So, here are the two different ways we can use to add borders to our videos or images.</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding a border to the video using a grid effect</li>
<li>Adding a border to the video using the essential graphics panel</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Way-1-Using-a-Grid-Effect"><a href="#Way-1-Using-a-Grid-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Using a Grid Effect"></a><strong>Way 1.</strong> <strong>Using a Grid Effect</strong></h3><p>While working on the project, make sure the aspect ratio of the video is 16:9, and project settings are HD (1080P) and UHD 4K in premiere pro.</p>
<p>Let’s start step by step.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Drag all the video clips by stacking them on video tracks in the timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hit the <strong>Effects</strong> tab and write the <strong>grid</strong> in the search panel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Simply drag the <strong>grid</strong> option into the timeline of the videos.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>anchor value</strong> to <strong>0</strong> for the x and y.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the <strong>size</strong> to <strong>width and height slider.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the <strong>width</strong> to <strong>1920</strong> and <strong>height</strong> to <strong>1080</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have borders added as you can see below.</p>
<p>You can also change the width of the borders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the <strong>width</strong> to <strong>30</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have the option to change the color of the border.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <strong>blending mode</strong> to <strong>normal</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>color picker</strong> tool and change the color of your desire.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Way-2-Using-the-Essential-Graphics-Panel"><a href="#Way-2-Using-the-Essential-Graphics-Panel" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Using the Essential Graphics Panel"></a><strong>Way 2.</strong> <strong>Using the Essential Graphics Panel</strong></h3><p>First of all, you wanna be in your premium pro graphics workspace. This will pull off your graphics panel on your right. The good thing about the essential graphics panel is, that it is vector-based. So the different video clips with different resolutions will not pixelate.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in…</p>
<p>Now, to use the graphics panel you need to perform the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Import</strong> the videos and drag them into the timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>effects</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Find <strong>“alpha adjust”</strong> and drag it into the effects control.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a <strong>4-point polygon mask</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A rectangular mask will be created. You can edit it according to the frame requirement.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to the corner of the mask border and press the shift key. Drag the border to resize and scale it proportionally.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Again go to effect controls, under <strong>opacity</strong> hit <strong>invert alpha</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under <strong>mask</strong> hit <strong>inverted</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>motion</strong> settings, change the <strong>position</strong>, and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Alpha adjust</strong> and set the <strong>mask feathering</strong> to <strong>0</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now go back to the <strong>effects</strong> panel and search the <strong>paint bucket</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under effects controls, hit the <strong>alpha channel</strong> under the <strong>fill selector</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Then hit <strong>stroke</strong> under the <strong>stroke</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>You can turn up the <strong>stroke width</strong> to make it a bit thicker.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hit the <strong>color</strong> tab to change the color of the border as desired.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>We have discussed different software to add borders. All the software and tools are free to use. Similarly, they can be used on both Mac as well as Windows. They are user-friendly and provide full control over borders. You can use any one of them to make your borders and can easily engage viewers in your videos.</p>
<p>In all of the above applications, I recommend you to use <strong>Wondershare filmora 11</strong>. It is the most professional software and makes your video stand out.</p>
<p><strong>Way 1.</strong> <strong>Using a Grid Effect</strong></p>
<p>While working on the project, make sure the aspect ratio of the video is 16:9, and project settings are HD (1080P) and UHD 4K in premiere pro.</p>
<p>Let’s start step by step.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Drag all the video clips by stacking them on video tracks in the timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hit the <strong>Effects</strong> tab and write the <strong>grid</strong> in the search panel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Simply drag the <strong>grid</strong> option into the timeline of the videos.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>anchor value</strong> to <strong>0</strong> for the x and y.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the <strong>size</strong> to <strong>width and height slider.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the <strong>width</strong> to <strong>1920</strong> and <strong>height</strong> to <strong>1080</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have borders added as you can see below.</p>
<p>You can also change the width of the borders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the <strong>width</strong> to <strong>30</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have the option to change the color of the border.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <strong>blending mode</strong> to <strong>normal</strong>.</li>

<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>We have discussed different software to add borders. All the software and tools are free to use. Similarly, they can be used on both Mac as well as Windows. They are user-friendly and provide full control over borders. You can use any one of them to make your borders and can easily engage viewers in your videos.</p>
<p>In all of the above applications, I recommend you to use <strong>Wondershare filmora 11</strong>. It is the most professional software and makes your video stand out.</p>
<p><strong>Way 1.</strong> <strong>Using a Grid Effect</strong></p>
<p>While working on the project, make sure the aspect ratio of the video is 16:9, and project settings are HD (1080P) and UHD 4K in premiere pro.</p>
<p>Let’s start step by step.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Drag all the video clips by stacking them on video tracks in the timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hit the <strong>Effects</strong> tab and write the <strong>grid</strong> in the search panel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Simply drag the <strong>grid</strong> option into the timeline of the videos.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>anchor value</strong> to <strong>0</strong> for the x and y.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the <strong>size</strong> to <strong>width and height slider.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the <strong>width</strong> to <strong>1920</strong> and <strong>height</strong> to <strong>1080</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have borders added as you can see below.</p>
<p>You can also change the width of the borders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the <strong>width</strong> to <strong>30</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have the option to change the color of the border.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <strong>blending mode</strong> to <strong>normal</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>color picker</strong> tool and change the color of your desire.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Way-2-Using-the-Essential-Graphics-Panel-3"><a href="#Way-2-Using-the-Essential-Graphics-Panel-3" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Using the Essential Graphics Panel"></a><strong>Way 2.</strong> <strong>Using the Essential Graphics Panel</strong></h3><p>First of all, you wanna be in your premium pro graphics workspace. This will pull off your graphics panel on your right. The good thing about the essential graphics panel is, that it is vector-based. So the different video clips with different resolutions will not pixelate.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in…</p>
<p>Now, to use the graphics panel you need to perform the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Import</strong> the videos and drag them into the timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>effects</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Find <strong>“alpha adjust”</strong> and drag it into the effects control.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a <strong>4-point polygon mask</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A rectangular mask will be created. You can edit it according to the frame requirement.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to the corner of the mask border and press the shift key. Drag the border to resize and scale it proportionally.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Again go to effect controls, under <strong>opacity</strong> hit <strong>invert alpha</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under <strong>mask</strong> hit <strong>inverted</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>motion</strong> settings, change the <strong>position</strong>, and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Alpha adjust</strong> and set the <strong>mask feathering</strong> to <strong>0</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now go back to the <strong>effects</strong> panel and search the <strong>paint bucket</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under effects controls, hit the <strong>alpha channel</strong> under the <strong>fill selector</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Then hit <strong>stroke</strong> under the <strong>stroke</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>You can turn up the <strong>stroke width</strong> to make it a bit thicker.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hit the <strong>color</strong> tab to change the color of the border as desired.</p>
</li>
</ul>

It’ll obviously and pleasing and eye-catchy effect in your video. These major requirements for making that cinematography can be covered as the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Light a subject</li>
<li>Create atmosphere</li>
<li>Light a set</li>
<li>Camera techniques</li>
<li>Aspect ratio</li>
<li>Framing</li>
<li>Camera movement</li>
</ol>
<p>Before, we go deeper to the details on how to make a cinematography for music, let us know first about the cinematography for music video. Everything is represented in this article, from the camera movement to the setting of the lights in the studio. You will also learn about aspect ratio and framing while making shots from the DSLR.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Cinematography"><a href="#What-Is-Cinematography" class="headerlink" title="What Is Cinematography?"></a>What Is Cinematography?</h2><p>Cinematography covers all aspects of how a movie or music video is made, including choosing the lighting for the scene. The type of camera equipment to use, how to frame your photographs, and how to decide on camera movement are also included in this. Let’s move toward the next lines to get the cool cinematography on display.</p>
<h2 id="Light-a-subject"><a href="#Light-a-subject" class="headerlink" title="Light a subject"></a>Light a subject</h2><p>Although you may assume that cinematography is just concerned with the usage of the camera, lighting plays an equally important role. While planning your photographs, you should think about how the scene is lit and how your subject is illuminated.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The cinematographer should consider the hard and soft lights for perfect illustrations during shooting. These are depicted with the following requirements!</p>
<h3 id="Hard-light-and-soft-light"><a href="#Hard-light-and-soft-light" class="headerlink" title="Hard light and soft light"></a>Hard light and soft light</h3><p>The cinematographers mainly focus on the hard and soft lights during filmmaking. The <strong>hard lights</strong> give a softer look to the subject. They are pointing to the light sources which are closer to the subject in the video. It makes the photographs and shots harsher and more dramatic.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="hard light on the subject"
                ></p>
<p>The <strong>soft light</strong> is trying to wrap around the subject. It gives diffused shadows and soft edges to the character of the music video.</p>

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To get better results of the soft look, you need to add diffusion to lower the intensity.</p>
<h2 id="Create-Atmosphere"><a href="#Create-Atmosphere" class="headerlink" title="Create Atmosphere"></a>Create Atmosphere</h2><p>You need a haze machine to create the atmosphere and give the environment true vibes. The haze machine gives a foggy appearance in every shoot and scene.</p>

<h2 id="Light-a-Set"><a href="#Light-a-Set" class="headerlink" title="Light a Set"></a>Light a Set</h2><p>To give proper lights in the set is illustrated with the help of an example as shown below!</p>
<h3 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a>Examples</h3><p>In this music video of the 3lau’s, the main prop used is a bus, which is presented in the middle of the set and lit very well. The bus is rounded by many tungsten lights, which give a resemblance to those street lights. They are set up automatically in such a way that this stimulates the real movement of the bus on the road.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>The three projectors are set to give the street footage at the back scene to add more realism.</p>
<p>The three lights are set in the queue by the production team to get the memory of the protagonist. In the setup, soft lights are also added on top of all the upper windows of the bus to give blue interior light to the bus.</p>
<h2 id="Camera-Techniques"><a href="#Camera-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Camera Techniques"></a>Camera Techniques</h2><p>The cameras used during filming play a major role in giving the cinematographic shots. All the techniques shown below are applied to the DSLRs and even the smartphones you use for filming.</p>
<h3 id="Prime-lenses"><a href="#Prime-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Prime lenses"></a>Prime lenses</h3><p>The foremost and most helpful lenses in filming are called prime lenses, which have fixed focal lengths. There is no Johns to zoom out and zoom-in in prime lenses.</p>
<p>For filming, we need to choose the right level of zoom, which the DP does by picking the right lens for the footage.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>In the close-up scenes, there is a requirement for a wider field of view which also depends on the aspect ratio of shooting.</p>
<h2 id="Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio"></a>Aspect Ratio</h2><p>In filmy view, the most appropriate aspect ratio is 2.35, which is also a cinematic ratio. There is also another ratio of 16:9, which is a wider ratio. While 2.35 gives a more narrow perspective as compared to the prior one.</p>

<p>Whenever we use a microscope, we are dealing with the aspect ratio and narrowing down to the required point where we want to look, and this is all about framing, which is discussed as shown below!</p>
<h2 id="Framing"><a href="#Framing" class="headerlink" title="Framing"></a>Framing</h2><p>Framing is a way used to illustrate the concepts such as the rule of thirds and leading lines. To give customized headroom to the subject, the framing is used from the top of the head and the top of the frame.</p>
<h2 id="Camera-Movement"><a href="#Camera-Movement" class="headerlink" title="Camera Movement"></a>Camera Movement</h2><p>The camera movement actually shows the real story presented in the music video. The camera movements used for filming are mainly the pedestal, truck, pan, tilt, and roll.</p>

<p>Whenever the protagonist looks out the bus’s window, the camera operator will use the “Dolly” and “Trucking” movements.</p>
<h3 id="Trucking-Movement"><a href="#Trucking-Movement" class="headerlink" title="Trucking Movement"></a>Trucking Movement</h3><p>The trucking movement of the camera is done in left-to-right motion in the filming. This is used for emotional purposes and whenever the subject is in a pull-out shot.</p>
<h3 id="Dolly-Movement"><a href="#Dolly-Movement" class="headerlink" title="Dolly Movement"></a>Dolly Movement</h3><p>The dolly movement of the camera is done by moving towards or away from the subject. This often gives a sense of importance to the character.</p>

You can choose different color gradients and many other things according to your preference. And then go to “file” and select “save for web.”</p>

They provide you with the essential tools to make the best GIFs out of any video you want.</p>
<p>So here is a step-by-step method to help you make your GIFs in Photoshop and impress your friends.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: One of the most important steps is to choose the video you want to use in your GIF. GIFs are supposed to be short and express what you want to in that concise sequence, and that’s why choosing a correct sequence of the right length is very important.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now you will have to download the video file to your computer and continue to trim it down to as few frames as possible, and choose the frames that convey the message as accurately as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Import the video to Photoshop by going to “File” &gt; “Import” &gt; “Video frames to layers.” Choose the video file you need, and it will appear in the form of separate frames. Now you can select whether you want the entire video or small bits of it; you can also limit the import to any frame to manage the size and time of the video. You can choose different color gradients and many other things according to your preference. And then go to “file” and select “save for web.”</p>

They provide you with the essential tools to make the best GIFs out of any video you want.</p>
<p>So here is a step-by-step method to help you make your GIFs in Photoshop and impress your friends.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: One of the most important steps is to choose the video you want to use in your GIF. GIFs are supposed to be short and express what you want to in that concise sequence, and that’s why choosing a correct sequence of the right length is very important.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now you will have to download the video file to your computer and continue to trim it down to as few frames as possible, and choose the frames that convey the message as accurately as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Import the video to Photoshop by going to “File” &gt; “Import” &gt; “Video frames to layers.” Choose the video file you need, and it will appear in the form of separate frames. Now you can select whether you want the entire video or small bits of it; you can also limit the import to any frame to manage the size and time of the video. You can choose different color gradients and many other things according to your preference. And then go to “file” and select “save for web.”</p>

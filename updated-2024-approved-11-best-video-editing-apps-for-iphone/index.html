How to use LUTs in VN editor?</h2><p>First, we must know that it is compatible with which platforms. So, it is now available for Android, iOS, and Mac OS only. However, you can also use it on Windows with some Android or iOS emulators, but it is not a very continent way in our suggestions. Even after doing this, it does not work well on your Windows. Maybe you will face some glitches or malfunctioning problems. So it is better to use it on only those platforms for which it is primarily available. Please read the instructions below since we will go through how to use LUTs in it later on.</p>
<p><strong>On Mac:</strong></p>
<p>First of all, we will learn how you can do it on Mac:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the VN Editor for Mac and open it.</li>
<li>Add your video and then tap the filters option.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="tap the filters option"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Now choose custom filters and then select the LUTs pack.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-3.jpg"
                      alt="select the luts pack"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Select the desired LUT and apply.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

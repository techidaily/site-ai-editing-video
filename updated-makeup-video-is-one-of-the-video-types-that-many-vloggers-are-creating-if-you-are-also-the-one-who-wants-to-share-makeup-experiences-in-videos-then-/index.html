<h3 id="Editing-Software"><a href="#Editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="Editing Software"></a><strong>Editing Software</strong></h3><p>Other than the camera and the video footage itself, the video editing software is the mores essential steps as a content creator. There are usually awkward moments during filming that you may want to edit out, and you may also need to add effects and interesting transition. You can use a video editor that you can download from google.</p>

Then get your camera or smart phone set up on a stable table with your cellphone stand to make it sturdy and make sure you have a suitable lighting. Dark video is not useful to anyone specially for something as detailed as applying a makeup.</p>

<h5 id="Step2Create-an-outline"><a href="#Step2Create-an-outline" class="headerlink" title="Step2Create an outline"></a>Step2Create an outline</h5><p>It may be helpful to create an outline or a script of your video beforehand so that you remember to do all the things your intent to do in your tutorial. This can also help you stay on track during filming so that you are remembering to demonstrate every part of your tutorial. Making a makeup tutorial video need also a step-by-step process so that you don’t forget anything that you will put or show in the video, you need to make a note or an outline for you to remember all because it so hustles to go back and record what you missed.</p>

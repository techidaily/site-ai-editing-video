<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid Instagram Video Cutter?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How do you post long videos on Instagram without splitting?</strong> Instagram allows users to post long videos on the app, as long as 60 seconds. Alternatively, you can use the IGTV to upload long clips on Instagram without splitting.</li>
<li><strong>What is multi-capture on Instagram:</strong> This tool allows you to create and share multiple photos on your stories.</li>
<li><strong>How do I split the video into two parts for Instagram on Mac?</strong> The paid and free video cutters shared above will help you split a video into two parts for Instagram on Mac. Simply pick the option that fits your preference.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video. When deciding which is the best option for you, free or paid, the factors listed will help you decide. Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

When deciding which is the best option for you, free or paid, the factors listed will help you decide. Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid Instagram Video Cutter?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video. When deciding which is the best option for you, free or paid, the factors listed will help you decide. Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid Instagram Video Cutter?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>

<p>Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:</p>
<p>Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.</p>
<p>The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It’s very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select “Trim start” or “Trim finish” from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-6.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the “Cutting and Splitting” option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-7.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.</p>
<p>To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect’s duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.</p>
<p>Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Save changes and export video.</p>
<p>Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC’s resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you’re finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.</p>

As a result, it’s widely utilized in the television and film industries - at least among Mac users. However, one of the truly convincing reasons to choose it over Premiere Pro is because it is subscription-free: you only pay once.</p>

It’s a strong software with a lot of features.</p>
<p>Follow the steps to edit FLV video using Final Cut Pro:</p>

VSDC"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>VSDC is a free video editor along with a lot of advanced features. Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.</p>
<p>Although it may not look logical, learning the editing capabilities hidden within modular boxes is simple. One noteworthy aspect of VSDC is its ability to produce good visual effects using many trendy video effects, transitions, and filters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, strong chroma keys, color correction, object modification, and other editing tools can be utilized to edit FLV videos. It not only creates excellent FLV videos, but it also supports a wide range of media conversion, allowing you to convert FLV files to various formats and export them without a watermark.</p>
<p>Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:</p>
<p>Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.</p>
<p>The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It’s very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select “Trim start” or “Trim finish” from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the “Cutting and Splitting” option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.</p>

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.</p>
<p>To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect’s duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.</p>
<p>Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Save changes and export video.</p>
<p>Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC’s resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you’re finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.</p>

<p> In contrast, this free video editor is perfect for semi-pros or those who want to enhance their video editing skills. However, you’ll need a lot of time and effort to learn it.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the application.</p>

Final Cut Pro:"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Final Cut Pro:</strong></h3><p>When it comes to video editing software, Apple’s Final Cut Pro is one of the industry standards. As a result, it’s widely utilized in the television and film industries - at least among Mac users. However, one of the truly convincing reasons to choose it over Premiere Pro is because it is subscription-free: you only pay once.</p>
<p>The software’s Magnetic Timeline, grouping tools, a vast selection of effects, solid organizational capabilities, and simple ways to add and edit audio make it a favorite among professional video editors. 360° video, HDR, and powerful color correcting tools are among the other capabilities.

Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.</p>
<p>Although it may not look logical, learning the editing capabilities hidden within modular boxes is simple. One noteworthy aspect of VSDC is its ability to produce good visual effects using many trendy video effects, transitions, and filters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, strong chroma keys, color correction, object modification, and other editing tools can be utilized to edit FLV videos. It not only creates excellent FLV videos, but it also supports a wide range of media conversion, allowing you to convert FLV files to various formats and export them without a watermark.</p>
<p>Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:</p>
<p>Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.</p>
<p>The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It’s very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select “Trim start” or “Trim finish” from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the “Cutting and Splitting” option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.</p>

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.</p>
<p>To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect’s duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.</p>
<p>Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Save changes and export video.</p>
<p>Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC’s resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you’re finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.</p>

<p> In contrast, this free video editor is perfect for semi-pros or those who want to enhance their video editing skills. However, you’ll need a lot of time and effort to learn it.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the application.</p>

Final Cut Pro:"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Final Cut Pro:</strong></h3><p>When it comes to video editing software, Apple’s Final Cut Pro is one of the industry standards. As a result, it’s widely utilized in the television and film industries - at least among Mac users. However, one of the truly convincing reasons to choose it over Premiere Pro is because it is subscription-free: you only pay once.</p>
<p>The software’s Magnetic Timeline, grouping tools, a vast selection of effects, solid organizational capabilities, and simple ways to add and edit audio make it a favorite among professional video editors. 360° video, HDR, and powerful color correcting tools are among the other capabilities.

VSDC"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>VSDC is a free video editor along with a lot of advanced features. Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.</p>
<p>Although it may not look logical, learning the editing capabilities hidden within modular boxes is simple. One noteworthy aspect of VSDC is its ability to produce good visual effects using many trendy video effects, transitions, and filters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, strong chroma keys, color correction, object modification, and other editing tools can be utilized to edit FLV videos. It not only creates excellent FLV videos, but it also supports a wide range of media conversion, allowing you to convert FLV files to various formats and export them without a watermark.</p>
<p>Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:</p>
<p>Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.</p>
<p>The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It’s very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select “Trim start” or “Trim finish” from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-6.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the “Cutting and Splitting” option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.</p>

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.</p>
<p>To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect’s duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.</p>
<p>Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Save changes and export video.</p>
<p>Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC’s resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you’re finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.</p>

Adobe Premiere Pro:"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Adobe Premiere Pro:</strong></h3><p>Professional video editors use Premiere Pro to make everything from YouTube videos to Hollywood films like Mank, a 2021 Oscar candidate. It’s also widely utilized in the workflows of designers, animators, and VFX artists, and we can see why after lengthy testing.</p>
<p>We found the software’s UI to be simple to use, and it increased our productivity by separating things into various workspaces, such as editing, effects, and audio. When we tested it on both Mac and PC, we discovered that each workspace helps handle a specific activity while minimizing distraction.</p>

<p> In contrast, this free video editor is perfect for semi-pros or those who want to enhance their video editing skills. However, you’ll need a lot of time and effort to learn it.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the application.</p>

Final Cut Pro:"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Final Cut Pro:</strong></h3><p>When it comes to video editing software, Apple’s Final Cut Pro is one of the industry standards. As a result, it’s widely utilized in the television and film industries - at least among Mac users. However, one of the truly convincing reasons to choose it over Premiere Pro is because it is subscription-free: you only pay once.</p>
<p>The software’s Magnetic Timeline, grouping tools, a vast selection of effects, solid organizational capabilities, and simple ways to add and edit audio make it a favorite among professional video editors. 360° video, HDR, and powerful color correcting tools are among the other capabilities. It’s a strong software with a lot of features.</p>

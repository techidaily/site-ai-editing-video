<p>Pixel art is digital art created through computer software. In this digital art, images are edited on a pixel level. This gives the kind of aesthetic from computer video games using 8-bit and 16-bit technology. In general, this art uses very few color palettes, with some using only two.</p>
<p>The history of pixel art goes back to the 1930s with the monochromatic light bulb displays in New York City.</p>
<p>Pixel art tries to mimic the features of old video game graphics done by computers that were only able to display a few colors at once.</p>
<p>Digital pixel art evolved in such a way that artists are now dedicated to that art, and so create beautiful pixel art wallpapers that we’ll show you in this article.</p>

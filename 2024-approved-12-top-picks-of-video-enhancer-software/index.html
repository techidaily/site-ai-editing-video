<p><strong>To Cut&#x2F;Trim Videos with Wondershare Filmora:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Drag and Drop the Video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming that you have already downloaded and installed Wondershare Filmora app, click to open. There are two ways through which you can locate your video.</p>
<p>One, you can opt to drag and drop the video from its location to the app’s timeline. Secondly, you can right click on the space at the top left then select the video to be edited from the dialogue box that will appear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-5.png"
                      alt="cut-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Trimming the video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After dropping the video on the timeline, it is likely to take up a lot of space, especially if it is long.</p>
<p>To trim the video from the beginning, place your cursor at the starting point and wait for the pointer to appear. Then move the point forward. To trim from the end, place the cursor at that point, hold and move the pointer forward till the required point.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-6.png"
                      alt="cut-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="cut-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Trimming the video does not mean that you lose the parts. It is more like shortening it to fit in place.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cutting the video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike trimming, cutting involves getting rid of a section of the video completely. To do so, you need to first of all isolate that section.</p>
<p>With the video on the timeline, move and point your cursor at the starting point of the video and click on the scissors icon at the top. Then move it to the end of the video section and click on the scissors icon again. By so doing, you will have selected that section.</p>
<p>Once the section has been selected, right click on the video, select and click to delete. You can then drag the remaining parts to make them one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="cut-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>After cutting or trimming, you can choose to add several effects to the video. Transitions, watermarks, cropping, resizing, ripple effects among others are some of the changes you could make. All these appear on the menu at the top.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Save and&#x2F;or Import your video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The final step is saving or importing your file to prevent its loss. By clicking on the ‘Import’ button, you save the file to the Media Library. By selecting ‘save as’, you select the location where you want to store your file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

So, let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Resolution</strong></p>
<p>The very first step for <strong>converting slides to digital photos</strong> is measuring and fixing the resolution of the slides. The technical measurement of image resolution is DPI (dot per inch). It helps you to predict the sharpness or clarity of the final image. The overall measurement depends on the size of the slide and the type of converter or scanner you are using. For example,</p>
<p>A 35 mm slide scanned at 10 MP will give you the images of size 13”*9”.</p>
<p>Step 2: Dust and Scratch Removal</p>
<p>If you have slides that have been wrapped in a box and remained untouched for so long, they might require cleaning. Such slides may develop mold buildup, age-related blemishes, or scratches. They need a cleaning process before using them to convert into slides. A lint-free cloth and an anti-static film cleaner are the best combinations to gently clean the slides and make them fresh.</p>
<p>Step 3: Color Correction and Restoration</p>
<p>Color correction and restoration is another important step when you are dealing with converting old slides into digital images. In order to correct the fading and color shift, you can use the built-in scanning software. You can also use other software for such purposes.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is the best tool which can be used for the color correction of old slides. It is a handy tool with a variety of features. Filmora offers a number of options when it comes to color correction and grading. These options include color histogram, white balance, 3D LUT (3D Lookup table), color and light, HSL, vignette, etc.</p>
<p>Step 4: Using the Best Scanner cum Digital Converter</p>
<p>The next step is choosing the best quality scanner according to the requirement. 35 mm is the most common size of the slides. But, it does come with other uncommon formats too such as 110, 126, 120, 127, etc. You will come to know about the actual size when the image is mounted on the cardboard. Therefore, it is essential to select a quality and versatile scanner which can convert slides of any size effectively.</p>

So, let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Resolution</strong></p>
<p>The very first step for <strong>converting slides to digital photos</strong> is measuring and fixing the resolution of the slides. The technical measurement of image resolution is DPI (dot per inch). It helps you to predict the sharpness or clarity of the final image. The overall measurement depends on the size of the slide and the type of converter or scanner you are using. For example,</p>
<p>A 35 mm slide scanned at 10 MP will give you the images of size 13”*9”.</p>
<p>Step 2: Dust and Scratch Removal</p>
<p>If you have slides that have been wrapped in a box and remained untouched for so long, they might require cleaning. Such slides may develop mold buildup, age-related blemishes, or scratches. They need a cleaning process before using them to convert into slides. A lint-free cloth and an anti-static film cleaner are the best combinations to gently clean the slides and make them fresh.</p>
<p>Step 3: Color Correction and Restoration</p>
<p>Color correction and restoration is another important step when you are dealing with converting old slides into digital images. In order to correct the fading and color shift, you can use the built-in scanning software. You can also use other software for such purposes.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is the best tool which can be used for the color correction of old slides. It is a handy tool with a variety of features. Filmora offers a number of options when it comes to color correction and grading. These options include color histogram, white balance, 3D LUT (3D Lookup table), color and light, HSL, vignette, etc.</p>
<p>Step 4: Using the Best Scanner cum Digital Converter</p>
<p>The next step is choosing the best quality scanner according to the requirement. 35 mm is the most common size of the slides. But, it does come with other uncommon formats too such as 110, 126, 120, 127, etc. You will come to know about the actual size when the image is mounted on the cardboard. Therefore, it is essential to select a quality and versatile scanner which can convert slides of any size effectively.</p>

So, let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Resolution</strong></p>
<p>The very first step for <strong>converting slides to digital photos</strong> is measuring and fixing the resolution of the slides. The technical measurement of image resolution is DPI (dot per inch). It helps you to predict the sharpness or clarity of the final image. The overall measurement depends on the size of the slide and the type of converter or scanner you are using. For example,</p>
<p>A 35 mm slide scanned at 10 MP will give you the images of size 13”*9”.</p>
<p>Step 2: Dust and Scratch Removal</p>
<p>If you have slides that have been wrapped in a box and remained untouched for so long, they might require cleaning. Such slides may develop mold buildup, age-related blemishes, or scratches. They need a cleaning process before using them to convert into slides. A lint-free cloth and an anti-static film cleaner are the best combinations to gently clean the slides and make them fresh.</p>
<p>Step 3: Color Correction and Restoration</p>
<p>Color correction and restoration is another important step when you are dealing with converting old slides into digital images. In order to correct the fading and color shift, you can use the built-in scanning software. You can also use other software for such purposes.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is the best tool which can be used for the color correction of old slides. It is a handy tool with a variety of features. Filmora offers a number of options when it comes to color correction and grading. These options include color histogram, white balance, 3D LUT (3D Lookup table), color and light, HSL, vignette, etc.</p>
<p>Step 4: Using the Best Scanner cum Digital Converter</p>
<p>The next step is choosing the best quality scanner according to the requirement. 35 mm is the most common size of the slides. But, it does come with other uncommon formats too such as 110, 126, 120, 127, etc. You will come to know about the actual size when the image is mounted on the cardboard. Therefore, it is essential to select a quality and versatile scanner which can convert slides of any size effectively.</p>

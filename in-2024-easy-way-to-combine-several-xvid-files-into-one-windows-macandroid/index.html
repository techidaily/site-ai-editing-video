<ol>
<li><strong>Importing an Xvid file</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are two ways to import a Xvid file.</p>
<p> Click Import to browse for Xvid videos on your computer and select all Xvid files to load while holding down the Ctrl or Shift key. Drag and drop the Xvid file directly into the program window.</p>
<p> If you want to add images and sounds and merge them seamlessly, do that. All regular image and audio files are supported.</p>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Drag and drop the Xvid video together</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> When you load all the Xvid files, they will appear as thumbnails in your album. To merge them, you need to drag and drop them one by one into the video timeline. They are seamlessly merged without gaps. Click the play icon to see the merged Xvid files in the screen on the right.</p>
<p> To change the order, simply drag the video element to the left or right. Note: Do not overlay another video clip. Otherwise, split and paste the original video in its place.</p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

<p>Select the resolution for which you want to export the video file and click Next.</p>
<p>You can also change the aspect ratio to suit the needs of other platforms and repeat the export process.</p>

<p> First, upload the video to Kapwing’s video merging tool. This free tool is available for iPhone, Android, PC, or tablet in Chrome or Safari browser. Click Upload to add the videos one at a time, or select multiple clips to import them all at once.</p>
<p> Kapwing supports major video file types such as MP4, .FLV, .3PG. To embed a video from the web, just copy and paste the link. You can upload photos and GIFs and combine them with videos.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Think of a video that looks great when spliced together into two consecutive videos. This can be a similar color palette, an event or travel video, or a video of the same person. When</p>
<p>videos are uploaded, the video preview shows how they look combined. Kapwing highlights each scene with a purple box during playback.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Place the video &#x2F;photo in the desired order.</strong></p>
<p>Think about which clips are next to each other and work best, and arrange them accordingly. You can drag clips to rearrange them and delete them when you no longer need them.</p>
<p>In the menu on the left, you can choose the format of the finished video (choose 1: 1 (square)), whether to crop the video (choose Fit to Border), and the length.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Drag both ends of the layer to change the timing of the start and end of the clip, or click the timing and use the arrow keys to make fine adjustments.</p>
<p>Besides trimming, you can look at other edits. To remove a section or add a clip in the center, use the split tool above the timeline or type “s” on your keyboard and use the shortcut.</p>
<p>Next, delete the layers you no longer need, drag the clips to combine them, and display them side by side on the timeline.</p>
<p> creators have more control over the montage by editing the scene in Studio. In Studio, you can add music to your montage,</p>
<p> insert title slides, attach endings, watermark corners, and animate.</p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

And as far as the question of what scene can be used for it, you can use any and every photo you want to match the colour for. And the following steps will be noting how you can adjust the color of an image in Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> Open both the images, the one you want to alter and the one you want to change it with. And if it is just one image, open and select that one image.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> Choose the “Image” and then select the “Adjustment” option. And after you choose the “Adjustment” option, go to the “Match Colour” option. You will be noticing the target photo that you have opted for.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> You will find the “Image Statistics” portion in the dialogue portion. Opt for the “Source” list and select the image name consisting of the shades and hues you would want your image to be altered. You will notice a thumbnail appearing in the dialogue as you do so. And you will automatically see the colours of the photo have changed.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> Now use the “Preview” feature to see the <strong>photoshop match colour tone</strong>, and then you will be done with adjusting the colour!</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-perfectly-match-colors-in-Photoshop-when-combining-photos"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-perfectly-match-colors-in-Photoshop-when-combining-photos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to perfectly match colors in Photoshop when combining photos"></a>Part 2 How to perfectly match colors in Photoshop when combining photos</h2><p>Now, we will be discussing the different steps that will help you <strong>match color from photo</strong> in Photoshop, with absolute precision and effortlessness. Here is the list of steps that you would need to follow to <strong>match skin tone in Photoshop</strong> most perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 Duplicate the background of the original photo</strong></p>
<p>The first and the most essential step to <strong>match lighting photoshop</strong> or the colour or any other editing task is to duplicate the background of the original image. The reason for this is that without this step, we might lose out on the original background information, which is essential for the image.</p>
<p>And to duplicate the background of an image in Photoshop, you need to use a few shortcuts of your keyboard. If you are using a Windows device, then the shortcut for this will be “Ctrl+J”, and if you are using Mac, then the shortcut will be “ Command+J”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-1.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop duplicate layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Select the Image whose colour you want to change.</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop has several selection tools. Choose one of the many selection tools. You might choose the “Pen Tool” or the “Lasso Tool” or anything else. Select the image with the tool by drawing along the image with the tool. And when you are done with tracing the image with the selection tool of your choice, you will see a border marching around the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="selection tool"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 Select the area of the second image</strong></p>
<p>You will need the selection tool again. The second image is the one that consists of the colour you would want the original image to match with. So, use the selection tool again to trace out an area in the second picture with the colour you want.</p>
<p>Ensure that you trace out a substantial area with the colour you need. You need not be highly precise with selecting the area. Instead, focus on covering a large area so that you can cover up the different shades and hues of the colour.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-3.jpg"
                      alt="select purple"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 Move back to the original picture</strong></p>
<p>We will proceed with the “Colour Match” feature in Photoshop, but before that, you must make sure that you have the original image selected. The technical term to use here is “Focus”. So, ensure that the original image is in focus.</p>
<p>You can bring the original image into “focus” by clicking anywhere inside the document’s window where the original image is present. And that will automatically bring back the focus to the original image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 Bring the “Colour Match” command into function</strong></p>
<p>After selecting the original image, reach out to the “Image” option and click on the “Adjustments” option. You will find the “Match Colour” option; click on it.</p>
<p>There are two sections of the “Color Match” option. One is the “Image Statistics” portion, and the other is the “Destination Image”. The “destination Image” portion consists of the name of the original image and a few image settings as well. The options include “luminescence”, “color intensity”, “fade”, and “neutralize”.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6 Head to the “Image Statistics” portion</strong></p>
<p>The “Image Statistics” portion consists of the “Source” option. It is present in the bottom down part of the “Image Statistics” box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the “Source” option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-5.jpg"
                      alt="match color source"
                ></p>
<p>Your image might have more than one layer, and if so, you will have to opt for the correct layer from the “Layer” option of Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7 Select the correct options in the “Image Statistics” area</strong></p>
<p>In the “Image Statistics” portion, you will find some options, such as “Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colours” and “Use Selection In Target To Calculate Adjustment”. You will have to click on this option and agree to them. It will instruct Photoshop to follow these instructions and colour match photos accordingly.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="match color"
                ></p>
<p>Click on “OK” after doing the changes mentioned above and exit the dialogue box to proceed with the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8 Add “Adjustment Layer”</strong></p>
<p>Go to the “Layers” option and then opt for the “Layers Palette” present at the bottom. Then select “New Adjustment Layer” and click on the “Levels” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="choose levels"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9 Adjust the Pointers</strong></p>
<p>You will find two pointers, one black and the other white. You will have to bring both the pointers to the centre of the line.</p>
<p>Then click on “OK” and exit the box to proceed with the next step.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="level adjustment layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10 Select “Luminosity”</strong></p>
<p>You will find the “Blend Mode” in the “Layers palette”. Select the “Blend Mode” from there. You will find it reflecting “Normal”, which is the default setting. You need to click on the small drop-down arrow and change the option from “Normal” to “Luminosity”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-9.jpg"
                      alt="luminosity blend mode"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11 Deselect</strong></p>
<p>Now, use the keyboard shortcut “Ctrl+D” if you are using windows and “Command+D” working on a Mac device. And this completes the entire process of colour matching in photoshop.</p>

Here is the list of steps that you would need to follow to <strong>match skin tone in Photoshop</strong> most perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 Duplicate the background of the original photo</strong></p>
<p>The first and the most essential step to <strong>match lighting photoshop</strong> or the colour or any other editing task is to duplicate the background of the original image. The reason for this is that without this step, we might lose out on the original background information, which is essential for the image.</p>
<p>And to duplicate the background of an image in Photoshop, you need to use a few shortcuts of your keyboard. If you are using a Windows device, then the shortcut for this will be “Ctrl+J”, and if you are using Mac, then the shortcut will be “ Command+J”.</p>

                      alt="photoshop duplicate layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Select the Image whose colour you want to change.</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop has several selection tools. Choose one of the many selection tools. You might choose the “Pen Tool” or the “Lasso Tool” or anything else. Select the image with the tool by drawing along the image with the tool. And when you are done with tracing the image with the selection tool of your choice, you will see a border marching around the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="selection tool"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 Select the area of the second image</strong></p>
<p>You will need the selection tool again. The second image is the one that consists of the colour you would want the original image to match with. So, use the selection tool again to trace out an area in the second picture with the colour you want.</p>
<p>Ensure that you trace out a substantial area with the colour you need. You need not be highly precise with selecting the area. Instead, focus on covering a large area so that you can cover up the different shades and hues of the colour.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select purple"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 Move back to the original picture</strong></p>
<p>We will proceed with the “Colour Match” feature in Photoshop, but before that, you must make sure that you have the original image selected. The technical term to use here is “Focus”. So, ensure that the original image is in focus.</p>
<p>You can bring the original image into “focus” by clicking anywhere inside the document’s window where the original image is present. And that will automatically bring back the focus to the original image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 Bring the “Colour Match” command into function</strong></p>
<p>After selecting the original image, reach out to the “Image” option and click on the “Adjustments” option. You will find the “Match Colour” option; click on it.</p>
<p>There are two sections of the “Color Match” option. One is the “Image Statistics” portion, and the other is the “Destination Image”. The “destination Image” portion consists of the name of the original image and a few image settings as well. The options include “luminescence”, “color intensity”, “fade”, and “neutralize”.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6 Head to the “Image Statistics” portion</strong></p>
<p>The “Image Statistics” portion consists of the “Source” option. It is present in the bottom down part of the “Image Statistics” box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the “Source” option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="match color source"
                ></p>
<p>Your image might have more than one layer, and if so, you will have to opt for the correct layer from the “Layer” option of Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7 Select the correct options in the “Image Statistics” area</strong></p>
<p>In the “Image Statistics” portion, you will find some options, such as “Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colours” and “Use Selection In Target To Calculate Adjustment”. You will have to click on this option and agree to them. It will instruct Photoshop to follow these instructions and colour match photos accordingly.</p>

                      alt="match color"
                ></p>
<p>Click on “OK” after doing the changes mentioned above and exit the dialogue box to proceed with the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8 Add “Adjustment Layer”</strong></p>
<p>Go to the “Layers” option and then opt for the “Layers Palette” present at the bottom. Then select “New Adjustment Layer” and click on the “Levels” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="choose levels"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9 Adjust the Pointers</strong></p>
<p>You will find two pointers, one black and the other white. You will have to bring both the pointers to the centre of the line.</p>
<p>Then click on “OK” and exit the box to proceed with the next step.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="level adjustment layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10 Select “Luminosity”</strong></p>
<p>You will find the “Blend Mode” in the “Layers palette”. Select the “Blend Mode” from there. You will find it reflecting “Normal”, which is the default setting. You need to click on the small drop-down arrow and change the option from “Normal” to “Luminosity”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="luminosity blend mode"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11 Deselect</strong></p>
<p>Now, use the keyboard shortcut “Ctrl+D” if you are using windows and “Command+D” working on a Mac device. And this completes the entire process of colour matching in photoshop.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Scene-is-Photoshop’s-Color-Matching-Generally-Used-For-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Scene-is-Photoshop’s-Color-Matching-Generally-Used-For-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Scene is Photoshop’s Color Matching Generally Used For?"></a>Part 1 What Scene is Photoshop’s Color Matching Generally Used For?</h2><p>You can <strong>match color in Photoshop</strong> in just a few simple steps. And as far as the question of what scene can be used for it, you can use any and every photo you want to match the colour for. And the following steps will be noting how you can adjust the color of an image in Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> Open both the images, the one you want to alter and the one you want to change it with. And if it is just one image, open and select that one image.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> Choose the “Image” and then select the “Adjustment” option. And after you choose the “Adjustment” option, go to the “Match Colour” option. You will be noticing the target photo that you have opted for.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> You will find the “Image Statistics” portion in the dialogue portion. Opt for the “Source” list and select the image name consisting of the shades and hues you would want your image to be altered. You will notice a thumbnail appearing in the dialogue as you do so. And you will automatically see the colours of the photo have changed.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> Now use the “Preview” feature to see the <strong>photoshop match colour tone</strong>, and then you will be done with adjusting the colour!</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-perfectly-match-colors-in-Photoshop-when-combining-photos-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-perfectly-match-colors-in-Photoshop-when-combining-photos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to perfectly match colors in Photoshop when combining photos"></a>Part 2 How to perfectly match colors in Photoshop when combining photos</h2><p>Now, we will be discussing the different steps that will help you <strong>match color from photo</strong> in Photoshop, with absolute precision and effortlessness. Here is the list of steps that you would need to follow to <strong>match skin tone in Photoshop</strong> most perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 Duplicate the background of the original photo</strong></p>
<p>The first and the most essential step to <strong>match lighting photoshop</strong> or the colour or any other editing task is to duplicate the background of the original image. The reason for this is that without this step, we might lose out on the original background information, which is essential for the image.</p>
<p>And to duplicate the background of an image in Photoshop, you need to use a few shortcuts of your keyboard. If you are using a Windows device, then the shortcut for this will be “Ctrl+J”, and if you are using Mac, then the shortcut will be “ Command+J”.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-1.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop duplicate layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Select the Image whose colour you want to change.</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop has several selection tools. Choose one of the many selection tools. You might choose the “Pen Tool” or the “Lasso Tool” or anything else. Select the image with the tool by drawing along the image with the tool. And when you are done with tracing the image with the selection tool of your choice, you will see a border marching around the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="selection tool"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 Select the area of the second image</strong></p>
<p>You will need the selection tool again. The second image is the one that consists of the colour you would want the original image to match with. So, use the selection tool again to trace out an area in the second picture with the colour you want.</p>
<p>Ensure that you trace out a substantial area with the colour you need. You need not be highly precise with selecting the area. Instead, focus on covering a large area so that you can cover up the different shades and hues of the colour.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-3.jpg"
                      alt="select purple"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 Move back to the original picture</strong></p>
<p>We will proceed with the “Colour Match” feature in Photoshop, but before that, you must make sure that you have the original image selected. The technical term to use here is “Focus”. So, ensure that the original image is in focus.</p>
<p>You can bring the original image into “focus” by clicking anywhere inside the document’s window where the original image is present. And that will automatically bring back the focus to the original image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 Bring the “Colour Match” command into function</strong></p>
<p>After selecting the original image, reach out to the “Image” option and click on the “Adjustments” option. You will find the “Match Colour” option; click on it.</p>
<p>There are two sections of the “Color Match” option. One is the “Image Statistics” portion, and the other is the “Destination Image”. The “destination Image” portion consists of the name of the original image and a few image settings as well. The options include “luminescence”, “color intensity”, “fade”, and “neutralize”.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6 Head to the “Image Statistics” portion</strong></p>
<p>The “Image Statistics” portion consists of the “Source” option. It is present in the bottom down part of the “Image Statistics” box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the “Source” option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-5.jpg"
                      alt="match color source"
                ></p>
<p>Your image might have more than one layer, and if so, you will have to opt for the correct layer from the “Layer” option of Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7 Select the correct options in the “Image Statistics” area</strong></p>
<p>In the “Image Statistics” portion, you will find some options, such as “Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colours” and “Use Selection In Target To Calculate Adjustment”. You will have to click on this option and agree to them. It will instruct Photoshop to follow these instructions and colour match photos accordingly.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="match color"
                ></p>
<p>Click on “OK” after doing the changes mentioned above and exit the dialogue box to proceed with the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8 Add “Adjustment Layer”</strong></p>
<p>Go to the “Layers” option and then opt for the “Layers Palette” present at the bottom. Then select “New Adjustment Layer” and click on the “Levels” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="choose levels"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9 Adjust the Pointers</strong></p>
<p>You will find two pointers, one black and the other white. You will have to bring both the pointers to the centre of the line.</p>
<p>Then click on “OK” and exit the box to proceed with the next step.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-8.jpg"
                      alt="level adjustment layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10 Select “Luminosity”</strong></p>
<p>You will find the “Blend Mode” in the “Layers palette”. Select the “Blend Mode” from there. You will find it reflecting “Normal”, which is the default setting. You need to click on the small drop-down arrow and change the option from “Normal” to “Luminosity”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-9.jpg"
                      alt="luminosity blend mode"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11 Deselect</strong></p>
<p>Now, use the keyboard shortcut “Ctrl+D” if you are using windows and “Command+D” working on a Mac device. And this completes the entire process of colour matching in photoshop.</p>

Therefore, if one is trying to make a photo collage in Microsoft Word, one might need to know the purpose and use of Microsoft collage maker as the kit can greatly help to create a photo collage in Word.</p>

It extends to the usage of photos and the creation of photo collages using these photos. Microsoft Word has the right features which you can easily use to organize pictures and photos in a certain way to make a photo collage. The <strong>collage maker Microsoft</strong> is not a hard operation to access if one knows the various options and operations of Microsoft Word well. There are different versions of Microsoft Word, all of which serve the same purposes but have different options and different icons representing various features. No matter which version you are using, the primary process of creating remains the same in all of those processes as it is simply the collection of the desired pictures, deciding on a particular shape and dimension of the page where you will arrange the pictures, inserting the pictures into the page, and then arranging them in a certain order.</p>
<p>Up until now, Microsoft has launched more than ten versions of Microsoft Word, with the preliminary ones being named “Microsoft Office”. In recent times, the newer version of Microsoft Word has become more user-friendly and thus it has become easier to perform so-called more complex tasks with the software, such as the creation of photo collages. With the addition of options and features to each newer version of Microsoft Word, it has become easier to work with graphics and arrange them or resize them or edit them in the desired way. More templates have been included in the newer versions to make it easy for the users to come to a decision when it comes to the shape of the collage and the number of pictures in it. Thus, it has various <strong>collage Microsoft Word</strong> options available now, which make the job much easier. There are a variety of options that are offered by the newer versions of Microsoft Word which will surely greatly help the user in creating photo collages as they open up the path to more features.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="design tab ms word"
                ></p>
<p>The difference has been in the quality and the quantity of the features that each of the new versions of Microsoft Word contains. For example, the older versions were predominantly used for text, and thus, there were not any viable options for pictures and arranging them, and creating a collage. The newer versions of Microsoft Word have sections and options entirely dedicated to the creation of collages and thus contain special <strong>Microsoft collage maker</strong> options which make it much easier to arrange pictures in certain ways and create collages. For example, the newer versions consist of features such as ‘SmartArt” which is a built-in feature to create collages in Microsoft Word. It is available in the newer versions of Word. ‘SmartArt” works as a <strong>Microsoft auto collage</strong> option.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The 2013 and 2016 versions of Microsoft Word also contain something called the ‘Developer” option, which can be accessed from the ‘Customizing the Ribbon” section. You can use it to specify the number of pictures and then insert pictures from a file. There is also the option of using Word Tables which can be used in any version of Microsoft Word to create a certain arrangement for your photo collage. Word Tables give the user complete control over the layout of the collage and this makes it easier for the user to arrange the pictures of the collage.</p>

It extends to the usage of photos and the creation of photo collages using these photos. Microsoft Word has the right features which you can easily use to organize pictures and photos in a certain way to make a photo collage. The <strong>collage maker Microsoft</strong> is not a hard operation to access if one knows the various options and operations of Microsoft Word well. There are different versions of Microsoft Word, all of which serve the same purposes but have different options and different icons representing various features. No matter which version you are using, the primary process of creating remains the same in all of those processes as it is simply the collection of the desired pictures, deciding on a particular shape and dimension of the page where you will arrange the pictures, inserting the pictures into the page, and then arranging them in a certain order.</p>
<p>Up until now, Microsoft has launched more than ten versions of Microsoft Word, with the preliminary ones being named “Microsoft Office”. In recent times, the newer version of Microsoft Word has become more user-friendly and thus it has become easier to perform so-called more complex tasks with the software, such as the creation of photo collages. With the addition of options and features to each newer version of Microsoft Word, it has become easier to work with graphics and arrange them or resize them or edit them in the desired way. More templates have been included in the newer versions to make it easy for the users to come to a decision when it comes to the shape of the collage and the number of pictures in it. Thus, it has various <strong>collage Microsoft Word</strong> options available now, which make the job much easier. There are a variety of options that are offered by the newer versions of Microsoft Word which will surely greatly help the user in creating photo collages as they open up the path to more features.</p>

                      alt="design tab ms word"
                ></p>
<p>The difference has been in the quality and the quantity of the features that each of the new versions of Microsoft Word contains. For example, the older versions were predominantly used for text, and thus, there were not any viable options for pictures and arranging them, and creating a collage. The newer versions of Microsoft Word have sections and options entirely dedicated to the creation of collages and thus contain special <strong>Microsoft collage maker</strong> options which make it much easier to arrange pictures in certain ways and create collages. For example, the newer versions consist of features such as ‘SmartArt” which is a built-in feature to create collages in Microsoft Word. It is available in the newer versions of Word. ‘SmartArt” works as a <strong>Microsoft auto collage</strong> option.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The 2013 and 2016 versions of Microsoft Word also contain something called the ‘Developer” option, which can be accessed from the ‘Customizing the Ribbon” section. You can use it to specify the number of pictures and then insert pictures from a file. There is also the option of using Word Tables which can be used in any version of Microsoft Word to create a certain arrangement for your photo collage. Word Tables give the user complete control over the layout of the collage and this makes it easier for the user to arrange the pictures of the collage.</p>

<p>You always have to be highly precise and appropriate when choosing the color for your wall. If you are not accurate enough, you might not choose the right shade, which would never look good on your walls. But, to help you match the paint colors perfectly, we have discussed three methods.</p>
<p>And lastly, we have also introduced a video editing tool <strong>Perfect Match Paint</strong> that will help you match the color in your videos as well. So, you can have the perfect desired color on your walls and also in your videos!</p>

<p>02 [Need to Color Match in Video? There’s an App for That…](#Part 2)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Match-Paint-Color-Without-a-Sample"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Match-Paint-Color-Without-a-Sample" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Match Paint Color Without a Sample"></a>Part 1 How to Match Paint Color Without a Sample</h2><p>We will be discussing three methods in which you will get the perfect answer to the question of how can I <strong>match my paint color</strong> perfectly. So, let us jump right into the first method without further delay.</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Perfect-Match-Paint-without-a-sample"><a href="#01Method-1-Perfect-Match-Paint-without-a-sample" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1 Perfect Match Paint without a sample"></a>01<strong>Method 1 Perfect Match Paint without a sample</strong></h3><p>The following steps will help you attain <strong>Perfect Match Paint</strong> without the necessity of a sample.</p>
<p><strong>Step Clean the print area</strong></p>
<p>The first and the most essential step is to make the area where you will be painting clean and tidy. As time passes, fingerprints, marks, dust, and many other things accumulate and make the area dirty. And if you do not clean the same, then the paint you do on it becomes much darker, dull, and gives a shabby outlook.</p>
<p>Use a damp sponge, and if possible, it is better to use soap on the sponge. And most importantly, you will have to let the area dry out completely before you put it on to test the paint. Moreover, the new paint adheres much better than before when you clean the area.</p>

                      alt="clean area"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step Scraping off</strong></p>
<p>The next step requires you to use a utility knife. And with that utility knife, you will have to scrap an inch or 2.5 cm of your wall paint. It is because, when you have a sample, you can easily bring that to the store for <strong>paint matching near me</strong>. Use a plastic bag to secure the sample price. It will prevent the paint of the sample to smudge or getting any marks or destruction.</p>
<p>And after you <strong>find paint colors</strong> that match the ones you need, try to dab a little of that paint on the sample. As a result, you will precisely know how perfectly the new shade of paint matches with the new one. It ensures optimum precision and can be the <strong>best way to match paint</strong>.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="scrapping off"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step Bring the object if possible</strong></p>
<p>The best way to maintain absolute precision in the match is by bringing an object to the store. You can also opt for a <strong>car paint match near me</strong>. If you bring the object with the color for matching, it ensures perfect matching and 10precision. Nowadays, the technology is highly advanced and will help you obtain the best paint match.</p>
<h3 id="02Method-2-Using-a-sample"><a href="#02Method-2-Using-a-sample" class="headerlink" title="02Method 2 Using a sample"></a>02<strong>Method 2 Using a sample</strong></h3><p>Since we have discussed the steps for matching paint without the sample, you must know how to match color with the help of samples. So, here are the steps for doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Click a Picture of the original hue</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary for better precision and matching the color as perfectly as possible. Clock a picture of the original color sample. The color in the photo might not be absolutely precise. But it can help to a large extent to match the color as perfectly as possible. You can easily take the sample to any renowned color matching store, like, <strong>dupli color paint match</strong> and have the perfect color matching done.</p>
<p>And it is better to not one picture or from just one angel. It will be best to take numerous snaps and that too, from different angles, sides and lighting conditions. It will help you get the original color shades in different angles, shades and lights, and it increases the possibility of matching the color as impeccably as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Bring home more than one sample</strong></p>
<p>You will see numerous samples of paints that you feel will match the color you brought from your home as a sample of the original color. You might not be sure which sample perfectly matches the original sample color at that exact moment. However, if you find a sample that seems t match perfectly, you must not make your decision right at that moment. Because in the store, the lighting, angles, and many other factors play a hugely influential role in enhancing the shades of the sample colors.</p>
<p>So, the color you see in the store often does not remain the same in natural light settings; it might get a bit darker or lighter. So, it is always better to bring home those samples that you feel match the original shade of the sample you brought. This increases the possibility of being the most precise and impeccable in matching the colors.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="samples color match"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: stick the sample and compare.</strong></p>
<p>This is the final step for matching the colors of paint with the help of a sample. After bringing home the samples that you found similar to the original sample, tape them to the wall. Take a sample at a time and use a tap to place them on the wall. You can also tape all the samples side by side, leaving enough gap between them.</p>
<p>It helps better compare and matches the sample’s colors and the wall. A common thing that occurs is that in the daytime, you find one color matching perfectly, whereas, in the nighttime, some other sample color is matching perfectly. In such an instance, it is best to ask the store if they can give you the shade by mixing both the colors: the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the daytime and the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the time.</p>

                      alt="taping samples"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Paint the samples on the wall</strong></p>
<p>It is an optional step, and you can opt for this step if you are not getting a hundred per cent confidence in choosing the correct color. Try to paint the colors of the samples that you are finding similar to the wall. Since the wall already has the original color, when you paint the sample colors on it, the sample colors clearly distinguish which samples match more impeccably with the actual color.</p>

So now, we will be listing down the steps that will help you match the paints with the help of mobile applications. The steps are given as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 Install the application</strong></p>
<p>You will find numerous mobile applications meant for matching paint colors. Opt for the ones you find the best and most efficient. Download it and install it on your phone. If you have used a renowned brand for painting, you can use their application. For example, you can use <strong>Asian paints color matching</strong> if you have used their brand of paints before.</p>

                      alt="color matching app"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Scan the shade</strong></p>
<p>Now, even the original paint shade. There are factors such as lighting, angel and shadow that you must remover to consider while you scan the color of the original sample.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="scanning shade in app"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 Paint the sample</strong></p>
<p>To be most precise and sure, paint the sample of the paint you have chosen. It will be a way of double-checking your division and ensuring a perfect paint match.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="paint sample"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 Use a color scanner</strong></p>
<p>It is another optional step, but there will be absolutely no doubt in the precision of paint matching if you use it. You can either borrow or buy a paint scanner. If you are not planning to paint again soon, it is best to borrow the paint scanner.</p>

So, let us jump right into the first method without further delay.</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Perfect-Match-Paint-without-a-sample-1"><a href="#01Method-1-Perfect-Match-Paint-without-a-sample-1" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1 Perfect Match Paint without a sample"></a>01<strong>Method 1 Perfect Match Paint without a sample</strong></h3><p>The following steps will help you attain <strong>Perfect Match Paint</strong> without the necessity of a sample.</p>
<p><strong>Step Clean the print area</strong></p>
<p>The first and the most essential step is to make the area where you will be painting clean and tidy. As time passes, fingerprints, marks, dust, and many other things accumulate and make the area dirty. And if you do not clean the same, then the paint you do on it becomes much darker, dull, and gives a shabby outlook.</p>
<p>Use a damp sponge, and if possible, it is better to use soap on the sponge. And most importantly, you will have to let the area dry out completely before you put it on to test the paint. Moreover, the new paint adheres much better than before when you clean the area.</p>

                      alt="clean area"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step Scraping off</strong></p>
<p>The next step requires you to use a utility knife. And with that utility knife, you will have to scrap an inch or 2.5 cm of your wall paint. It is because, when you have a sample, you can easily bring that to the store for <strong>paint matching near me</strong>. Use a plastic bag to secure the sample price. It will prevent the paint of the sample to smudge or getting any marks or destruction.</p>
<p>And after you <strong>find paint colors</strong> that match the ones you need, try to dab a little of that paint on the sample. As a result, you will precisely know how perfectly the new shade of paint matches with the new one. It ensures optimum precision and can be the <strong>best way to match paint</strong>.</p>

                      alt="scrapping off"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step Bring the object if possible</strong></p>
<p>The best way to maintain absolute precision in the match is by bringing an object to the store. You can also opt for a <strong>car paint match near me</strong>. If you bring the object with the color for matching, it ensures perfect matching and 10precision. Nowadays, the technology is highly advanced and will help you obtain the best paint match.</p>
<h3 id="02Method-2-Using-a-sample-1"><a href="#02Method-2-Using-a-sample-1" class="headerlink" title="02Method 2 Using a sample"></a>02<strong>Method 2 Using a sample</strong></h3><p>Since we have discussed the steps for matching paint without the sample, you must know how to match color with the help of samples. So, here are the steps for doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Click a Picture of the original hue</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary for better precision and matching the color as perfectly as possible. Clock a picture of the original color sample. The color in the photo might not be absolutely precise. But it can help to a large extent to match the color as perfectly as possible. You can easily take the sample to any renowned color matching store, like, <strong>dupli color paint match</strong> and have the perfect color matching done.</p>
<p>And it is better to not one picture or from just one angel. It will be best to take numerous snaps and that too, from different angles, sides and lighting conditions. It will help you get the original color shades in different angles, shades and lights, and it increases the possibility of matching the color as impeccably as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Bring home more than one sample</strong></p>
<p>You will see numerous samples of paints that you feel will match the color you brought from your home as a sample of the original color. You might not be sure which sample perfectly matches the original sample color at that exact moment. However, if you find a sample that seems t match perfectly, you must not make your decision right at that moment. Because in the store, the lighting, angles, and many other factors play a hugely influential role in enhancing the shades of the sample colors.</p>
<p>So, the color you see in the store often does not remain the same in natural light settings; it might get a bit darker or lighter. So, it is always better to bring home those samples that you feel match the original shade of the sample you brought. This increases the possibility of being the most precise and impeccable in matching the colors.</p>

                      alt="samples color match"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: stick the sample and compare.</strong></p>
<p>This is the final step for matching the colors of paint with the help of a sample. After bringing home the samples that you found similar to the original sample, tape them to the wall. Take a sample at a time and use a tap to place them on the wall. You can also tape all the samples side by side, leaving enough gap between them.</p>
<p>It helps better compare and matches the sample’s colors and the wall. A common thing that occurs is that in the daytime, you find one color matching perfectly, whereas, in the nighttime, some other sample color is matching perfectly. In such an instance, it is best to ask the store if they can give you the shade by mixing both the colors: the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the daytime and the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the time.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Paint the samples on the wall</strong></p>
<p>It is an optional step, and you can opt for this step if you are not getting a hundred per cent confidence in choosing the correct color. Try to paint the colors of the samples that you are finding similar to the wall. Since the wall already has the original color, when you paint the sample colors on it, the sample colors clearly distinguish which samples match more impeccably with the actual color.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1 Install the application</strong></p>
<p>You will find numerous mobile applications meant for matching paint colors. Opt for the ones you find the best and most efficient. Download it and install it on your phone.

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Scan the shade</strong></p>
<p>Now, even the original paint shade. There are factors such as lighting, angel and shadow that you must remover to consider while you scan the color of the original sample.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 Paint the sample</strong></p>
<p>To be most precise and sure, paint the sample of the paint you have chosen. It will be a way of double-checking your division and ensuring a perfect paint match.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 Use a color scanner</strong></p>
<p>It is another optional step, but there will be absolutely no doubt in the precision of paint matching if you use it. You can either borrow or buy a paint scanner. If you are not planning to paint again soon, it is best to borrow the paint scanner.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Match-Paint-Color-Without-a-Sample-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Match-Paint-Color-Without-a-Sample-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Match Paint Color Without a Sample"></a>Part 1 How to Match Paint Color Without a Sample</h2><p>We will be discussing three methods in which you will get the perfect answer to the question of how can I <strong>match my paint color</strong> perfectly. So, let us jump right into the first method without further delay.</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Perfect-Match-Paint-without-a-sample-3"><a href="#01Method-1-Perfect-Match-Paint-without-a-sample-3" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1 Perfect Match Paint without a sample"></a>01<strong>Method 1 Perfect Match Paint without a sample</strong></h3><p>The following steps will help you attain <strong>Perfect Match Paint</strong> without the necessity of a sample.</p>
<p><strong>Step Clean the print area</strong></p>
<p>The first and the most essential step is to make the area where you will be painting clean and tidy. As time passes, fingerprints, marks, dust, and many other things accumulate and make the area dirty. And if you do not clean the same, then the paint you do on it becomes much darker, dull, and gives a shabby outlook.</p>
<p>Use a damp sponge, and if possible, it is better to use soap on the sponge. And most importantly, you will have to let the area dry out completely before you put it on to test the paint. Moreover, the new paint adheres much better than before when you clean the area.</p>

                      alt="clean area"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step Scraping off</strong></p>
<p>The next step requires you to use a utility knife. And with that utility knife, you will have to scrap an inch or 2.5 cm of your wall paint. It is because, when you have a sample, you can easily bring that to the store for <strong>paint matching near me</strong>. Use a plastic bag to secure the sample price. It will prevent the paint of the sample to smudge or getting any marks or destruction.</p>
<p>And after you <strong>find paint colors</strong> that match the ones you need, try to dab a little of that paint on the sample. As a result, you will precisely know how perfectly the new shade of paint matches with the new one. It ensures optimum precision and can be the <strong>best way to match paint</strong>.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="scrapping off"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step Bring the object if possible</strong></p>
<p>The best way to maintain absolute precision in the match is by bringing an object to the store. You can also opt for a <strong>car paint match near me</strong>. If you bring the object with the color for matching, it ensures perfect matching and 10precision. Nowadays, the technology is highly advanced and will help you obtain the best paint match.</p>
<h3 id="02Method-2-Using-a-sample-3"><a href="#02Method-2-Using-a-sample-3" class="headerlink" title="02Method 2 Using a sample"></a>02<strong>Method 2 Using a sample</strong></h3><p>Since we have discussed the steps for matching paint without the sample, you must know how to match color with the help of samples. So, here are the steps for doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Click a Picture of the original hue</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary for better precision and matching the color as perfectly as possible. Clock a picture of the original color sample. The color in the photo might not be absolutely precise. But it can help to a large extent to match the color as perfectly as possible. You can easily take the sample to any renowned color matching store, like, <strong>dupli color paint match</strong> and have the perfect color matching done.</p>
<p>And it is better to not one picture or from just one angel. It will be best to take numerous snaps and that too, from different angles, sides and lighting conditions. It will help you get the original color shades in different angles, shades and lights, and it increases the possibility of matching the color as impeccably as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Bring home more than one sample</strong></p>
<p>You will see numerous samples of paints that you feel will match the color you brought from your home as a sample of the original color. You might not be sure which sample perfectly matches the original sample color at that exact moment. However, if you find a sample that seems t match perfectly, you must not make your decision right at that moment. Because in the store, the lighting, angles, and many other factors play a hugely influential role in enhancing the shades of the sample colors.</p>
<p>So, the color you see in the store often does not remain the same in natural light settings; it might get a bit darker or lighter. So, it is always better to bring home those samples that you feel match the original shade of the sample you brought. This increases the possibility of being the most precise and impeccable in matching the colors.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="samples color match"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: stick the sample and compare.</strong></p>
<p>This is the final step for matching the colors of paint with the help of a sample. After bringing home the samples that you found similar to the original sample, tape them to the wall. Take a sample at a time and use a tap to place them on the wall. You can also tape all the samples side by side, leaving enough gap between them.</p>
<p>It helps better compare and matches the sample’s colors and the wall. A common thing that occurs is that in the daytime, you find one color matching perfectly, whereas, in the nighttime, some other sample color is matching perfectly. In such an instance, it is best to ask the store if they can give you the shade by mixing both the colors: the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the daytime and the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the time.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Paint the samples on the wall</strong></p>
<p>It is an optional step, and you can opt for this step if you are not getting a hundred per cent confidence in choosing the correct color. Try to paint the colors of the samples that you are finding similar to the wall. Since the wall already has the original color, when you paint the sample colors on it, the sample colors clearly distinguish which samples match more impeccably with the actual color.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1 Install the application</strong></p>
<p>You will find numerous mobile applications meant for matching paint colors. Opt for the ones you find the best and most efficient. Download it and install it on your phone. If you have used a renowned brand for painting, you can use their application. For example, you can use <strong>Asian paints color matching</strong> if you have used their brand of paints before.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Scan the shade</strong></p>
<p>Now, even the original paint shade. There are factors such as lighting, angel and shadow that you must remover to consider while you scan the color of the original sample.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 Paint the sample</strong></p>
<p>To be most precise and sure, paint the sample of the paint you have chosen. It will be a way of double-checking your division and ensuring a perfect paint match.</p>

FLV stands for “Flash Video”. It is a container file format like .mp4 and .mov. But it isn’t used quite frequently nowadays. They are mainly used for streaming videos.

If you have recently started working with .flv files or need more info about it then read till the end. We have gathered all the necessary information for you in this article.</p>

<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>
<p> <strong>It is available for both Windows and Mac.</strong></p>

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.</p>
<p><strong>How to play .FLV files?</strong></p>
<p>To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that’s not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>
<p>Simply Open VLC Media Player &gt;&gt; Click Media tab &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; On pop up menu Select “Add” to add file (can add multiple files also) &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; Add Destination folder and File Format (to convert in) then click “Start”.</p>
<p><strong>Hand Brake:</strong> It is another popular video converter that can convert a .flv file into almost any file format.</p>
<p>Open HandBrake-“Drop a file” screen will appear &gt;&gt; Select the specific file you one to convert &gt;&gt; Select Destination filder &gt;&gt; Click “Start encoding”.</p>
<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>
<p> <strong>It is available for both Windows and Mac.</strong></p>

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.</p>

<p>To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that’s not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>

<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>

<p>A logo is a brand image of a company, it’s the face of a company and it represents the company out there in the market. In today’s world, the most famous companies are recognized worldwide via their brand image. Be it the “big M” of McDonald’s or the “horses” of Ferrari, we very well know these brands by their respective logos. A company’s logo is hence one of the most essential parts of branding and marketing. Moreover, a logo is one of the first steps towards brand building.

Well, today we shall tell you everything about a transparent logo, for instance, the transparent WhatsApp logo!</p>

It is generally in PNG format or vector format. So what differentiates a normal logo from a transparent logo? Well, the key differentiator between a regular logo and a transparent logo is that in a transparent logo, the background of the image file is transparent i.e. you cannot see a white or any other background in a transparent logo. This makes the logo more prominent and attractive. Since a logo is a key part of branding, an attractive transparent becomes all the more important for your brand’s success and prosperity!</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-When-Should-You-Use-the-PNG-or-Vector-Format"><a href="#Part-2-When-Should-You-Use-the-PNG-or-Vector-Format" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?"></a>Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?</h2><p>What’s the difference between a white background and a transparent background? Well, a white background tends to outshine the logo and reduces the fanciness of the logo. On the other hand, a transparent background logo goes well with any background. For instance, if the page behind the logo is black, if you were to place a white background logo on a black page, it’d look absurd. On the other hand, if your logo’s background is transparent, the color of the page wouldn’t matter. Your logo would look good irrespective of the background’s color. Since you will use your logo on not just one but multiple platforms, it becomes highly important to have a transparent background for your logo. For instance, if you use your logo on a website with an off white background, a transparent logo would suit much better than a generic white background logo. Using a white background logo would make it look clumsy and would leave a disregarding first impression.</p>
<p>Using PNG files helps you in multiple ways. Firstly, because PNG format files are generally compressed. They occupy very little space on your website. Moreover, a PNG format file supports lossless compression unlike other counterparts such as JPG and JPEG file formats. PNG files facilitate very high quality and occupy minimum space on your disk. PNG files also describe the features of an image very well. This means that it represents intricate details such as gradient, transparency, and other well-defined features very neatly.</p>

It is generally in PNG format or vector format. So what differentiates a normal logo from a transparent logo? Well, the key differentiator between a regular logo and a transparent logo is that in a transparent logo, the background of the image file is transparent i.e. you cannot see a white or any other background in a transparent logo. This makes the logo more prominent and attractive. Since a logo is a key part of branding, an attractive transparent becomes all the more important for your brand’s success and prosperity!</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-When-Should-You-Use-the-PNG-or-Vector-Format-1"><a href="#Part-2-When-Should-You-Use-the-PNG-or-Vector-Format-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?"></a>Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?</h2><p>What’s the difference between a white background and a transparent background? Well, a white background tends to outshine the logo and reduces the fanciness of the logo. On the other hand, a transparent background logo goes well with any background. For instance, if the page behind the logo is black, if you were to place a white background logo on a black page, it’d look absurd. On the other hand, if your logo’s background is transparent, the color of the page wouldn’t matter. Your logo would look good irrespective of the background’s color. Since you will use your logo on not just one but multiple platforms, it becomes highly important to have a transparent background for your logo. For instance, if you use your logo on a website with an off white background, a transparent logo would suit much better than a generic white background logo. Using a white background logo would make it look clumsy and would leave a disregarding first impression.</p>
<p>Using PNG files helps you in multiple ways. Firstly, because PNG format files are generally compressed. They occupy very little space on your website. Moreover, a PNG format file supports lossless compression unlike other counterparts such as JPG and JPEG file formats. PNG files facilitate very high quality and occupy minimum space on your disk. PNG files also describe the features of an image very well. This means that it represents intricate details such as gradient, transparency, and other well-defined features very neatly.</p>

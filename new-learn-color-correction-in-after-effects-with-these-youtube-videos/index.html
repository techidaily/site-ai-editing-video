<p>GIFs have been around for quite some time but as the flow of content continues to plummet on popular social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, the demand for GIFs would continue to increase.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you won’t be able to <strong>make a gif in after effects</strong> directly, unless with the help of a plug-in like GIFGun.</p>
<p>Before moving forward, keep in mind that using Adobe Media Encoder is an easier method for compressing your exports rather than any third-party compressor.</p>
<p>In this article, you will find easy to follow methods using which you can create <strong>after effects GIFs</strong> within a matter of minutes.</p>

This was developed back in 1987 by a working in CompuServe.</p>
<p>This format was incredibly successful on the WEB due to benefits like smaller file sizes, broader support, and its easy compatibility with Operating Systems.</p>
<p>However, GIFs are much more suitable as simple graphics and logos rather than Live Action Videos with its palette limitation of 256 per image.</p>
<p>Creating a GIF is like looping an animation or animated elements. You can use these animated GIFs in banners to engage your audience or even create fun sharable content for your Facebook pages.</p>
<p>You can start by creating basic easy animations in Photoshop and then elevate them by using After Effects.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> You can provide instructions in a short span of time.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> UX designers use GIFs to show the functioning of certain digital experiences.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can introduce GIFs on your page to keep followers engaged.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can display some amazing things on your website.</p>

<p>Now, for those who are learning Photoshop and After Effects for the first time, to understand the difference in results between both these software lets familiarize you with their features in brief.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-Similar"><a href="#01What’s-Similar" class="headerlink" title="01What’s Similar?"></a>01What’s Similar?</h3><p>Since both are designed by Adobe, there are bound to be similarities in the tools and interface they use. Both these software enables you to use layers of editing from the layer panel where you separate the blending or transform multiple layers. You can apply masks to these layers in different ways on both software.</p>
<h3 id="02Groups-PS-and-Nested-AE-Composition"><a href="#02Groups-PS-and-Nested-AE-Composition" class="headerlink" title="02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition"></a>02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition</h3><p>In Photoshop, you can group layers together and apply styles, blends, and transformations together. However, in After Effects, this is called Nesting.</p>
<p>Both are in a way similar to each other but Nesting Comps give users more functionality as it interprets probable compositions during the nesting process.</p>
<p>Smart objects used in PS are also comparable to Nested Comps as you can apply filters over one while applying effects to the other.</p>
<h3 id="03Vector-and-Shapes"><a href="#03Vector-and-Shapes" class="headerlink" title="03Vector and Shapes"></a>03Vector and Shapes</h3><p>You can use the Pen tool or Shape tool in both PS and AE that creates shape layers without losing any integrity. Both the applications support Bezier which lets you control curves between anchor points in PS and vertices in AE.</p>
<h3 id="04Destructive-Effects"><a href="#04Destructive-Effects" class="headerlink" title="04Destructive Effects"></a>04Destructive Effects</h3><p>After Effects does not provide you with destructive effects while in Photoshop you can apply non-destructive filters. You can also combine several layers to apply changes or distort your images but these permanent changes cannot be made in After Effects.</p>
<p>You will also notice that although there are several similarities, there are tools and features which are not shared between both applications. The types of tool categories would also vary. Like with After Effects, you can create paragraph and character styles that you can apply to texts.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-After-Effects-Gifs"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-After-Effects-Gifs" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs"></a>Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs</h2><p>After Effects harbors greater video editing capabilities rather than the basic animating options you can try on Photoshop. In creating a GIF, you would want to leverage the combination of tools offered on both After Effects and Photoshop.</p>
<p>Let’s first get into how you can create an animated video on After Effects and then convert it into an animated GIF in Photoshop.</p>
<h3 id="01Animating-in-After-Effects"><a href="#01Animating-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="01Animating in After Effects"></a>01Animating in After Effects</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open After Effects, go to ‘Composition’ and create ‘New Composition’. You will need to fill out the dimensions and specs for your project on the window that pops up. For example, 300x250 px at 30 fps and 6 sec duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="new composition after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can import assets by dragging and dropping, or by going to the ‘Project Panel’ in the After Effects Workspace as shown in the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-2.jpg"
                      alt="project panel after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, you can begin animating your Assets. Drag them and add them to the ‘Composition’ panel or ‘Timeline’ panel. Placing them in either one will make them appear on both. Adjust the layers according to the topmost layer on the panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-3.jpg"
                      alt="timeline panel"
                ></p>
<p>Dial down the scale of every animation to 0% so that can be animated in a growing sequence. Select the layer you wish to adjust and click on ‘Transform’. Click on ‘Scale’ to give that layer an active marker on the timeline. Set the scale to 0%.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-4.jpg"
                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>You can now begin animating the first item by moving the current time indicator to 06f (the 6th frame on the 30fps timeline). Scale the item back to 100% and the marker will reappear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>Repeat this for the other items. Keep in mind that each item has a 06f space between them for later adjustability.</p>

<p>GIFs have been around for quite some time but as the flow of content continues to plummet on popular social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, the demand for GIFs would continue to increase.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you won’t be able to <strong>make a gif in after effects</strong> directly, unless with the help of a plug-in like GIFGun.</p>
<p>Before moving forward, keep in mind that using Adobe Media Encoder is an easier method for compressing your exports rather than any third-party compressor.</p>

This was developed back in 1987 by a working in CompuServe.</p>
<p>This format was incredibly successful on the WEB due to benefits like smaller file sizes, broader support, and its easy compatibility with Operating Systems.</p>
<p>However, GIFs are much more suitable as simple graphics and logos rather than Live Action Videos with its palette limitation of 256 per image.</p>
<p>Creating a GIF is like looping an animation or animated elements. You can use these animated GIFs in banners to engage your audience or even create fun sharable content for your Facebook pages.</p>
<p>You can start by creating basic easy animations in Photoshop and then elevate them by using After Effects.</p>
<h3 id="02Why-create-a-GIF-1"><a href="#02Why-create-a-GIF-1" class="headerlink" title="02Why create a GIF?"></a>02Why create a GIF?</h3><p>Here are a handful of things you can keep your eye on if you are just starting on making GIFs;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simple Product Demonstrations. With simple 3 to 4 step GIFs, you can briefly introduce steps on how to use a product.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can provide instructions in a short span of time.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> UX designers use GIFs to show the functioning of certain digital experiences.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can introduce GIFs on your page to keep followers engaged.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can display some amazing things on your website.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Difference-between-making-GIFs-in-After-Effects-and-Photoshop-1"><a href="#Part-2-Difference-between-making-GIFs-in-After-Effects-and-Photoshop-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Difference between making GIFs in After Effects and Photoshop"></a>Part 2 Difference between making GIFs in After Effects and Photoshop</h2><p>Creating GIFs in After Effects and Photoshop are both one in the same thing but the results may vary depending on which choice of tools and features suits you better.</p>
<p>Now, for those who are learning Photoshop and After Effects for the first time, to understand the difference in results between both these software lets familiarize you with their features in brief.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-Similar-1"><a href="#01What’s-Similar-1" class="headerlink" title="01What’s Similar?"></a>01What’s Similar?</h3><p>Since both are designed by Adobe, there are bound to be similarities in the tools and interface they use. Both these software enables you to use layers of editing from the layer panel where you separate the blending or transform multiple layers. You can apply masks to these layers in different ways on both software.</p>
<h3 id="02Groups-PS-and-Nested-AE-Composition-1"><a href="#02Groups-PS-and-Nested-AE-Composition-1" class="headerlink" title="02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition"></a>02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition</h3><p>In Photoshop, you can group layers together and apply styles, blends, and transformations together. However, in After Effects, this is called Nesting.</p>
<p>Both are in a way similar to each other but Nesting Comps give users more functionality as it interprets probable compositions during the nesting process.</p>
<p>Smart objects used in PS are also comparable to Nested Comps as you can apply filters over one while applying effects to the other.</p>
<h3 id="03Vector-and-Shapes-1"><a href="#03Vector-and-Shapes-1" class="headerlink" title="03Vector and Shapes"></a>03Vector and Shapes</h3><p>You can use the Pen tool or Shape tool in both PS and AE that creates shape layers without losing any integrity. Both the applications support Bezier which lets you control curves between anchor points in PS and vertices in AE.</p>
<h3 id="04Destructive-Effects-1"><a href="#04Destructive-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="04Destructive Effects"></a>04Destructive Effects</h3><p>After Effects does not provide you with destructive effects while in Photoshop you can apply non-destructive filters. You can also combine several layers to apply changes or distort your images but these permanent changes cannot be made in After Effects.</p>
<p>You will also notice that although there are several similarities, there are tools and features which are not shared between both applications. The types of tool categories would also vary. Like with After Effects, you can create paragraph and character styles that you can apply to texts.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-After-Effects-Gifs-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-After-Effects-Gifs-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs"></a>Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs</h2><p>After Effects harbors greater video editing capabilities rather than the basic animating options you can try on Photoshop. In creating a GIF, you would want to leverage the combination of tools offered on both After Effects and Photoshop.</p>
<p>Let’s first get into how you can create an animated video on After Effects and then convert it into an animated GIF in Photoshop.</p>
<h3 id="01Animating-in-After-Effects-1"><a href="#01Animating-in-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="01Animating in After Effects"></a>01Animating in After Effects</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open After Effects, go to ‘Composition’ and create ‘New Composition’. You will need to fill out the dimensions and specs for your project on the window that pops up. For example, 300x250 px at 30 fps and 6 sec duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="new composition after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can import assets by dragging and dropping, or by going to the ‘Project Panel’ in the After Effects Workspace as shown in the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-2.jpg"
                      alt="project panel after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, you can begin animating your Assets. Drag them and add them to the ‘Composition’ panel or ‘Timeline’ panel. Placing them in either one will make them appear on both. Adjust the layers according to the topmost layer on the panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-3.jpg"
                      alt="timeline panel"
                ></p>
<p>Dial down the scale of every animation to 0% so that can be animated in a growing sequence. Select the layer you wish to adjust and click on ‘Transform’. Click on ‘Scale’ to give that layer an active marker on the timeline. Set the scale to 0%.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>You can now begin animating the first item by moving the current time indicator to 06f (the 6th frame on the 30fps timeline). Scale the item back to 100% and the marker will reappear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>Repeat this for the other items. Keep in mind that each item has a 06f space between them for later adjustability.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="repeat process"
                ></p>
<p>Your equation is now complete and all that is left to do is animate your CTA button. Adjust the position of the top layer on your CTA and set the current time indicator to start time on the button animation. Click on ‘position’ to set up a marker on your Timeline. Forward the 04f then nudge the button and reverse back to the original position so that it looks like a button clicking animation.</p>

                      alt="set position"
                ></p>
<p>Your animation is now complete. Now go to ‘Composition’ and shorten the time in the ‘Duration’ panel.</p>

<p>Now, for those who are learning Photoshop and After Effects for the first time, to understand the difference in results between both these software lets familiarize you with their features in brief.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-Similar-2"><a href="#01What’s-Similar-2" class="headerlink" title="01What’s Similar?"></a>01What’s Similar?</h3><p>Since both are designed by Adobe, there are bound to be similarities in the tools and interface they use. Both these software enables you to use layers of editing from the layer panel where you separate the blending or transform multiple layers. You can apply masks to these layers in different ways on both software.</p>
<h3 id="02Groups-PS-and-Nested-AE-Composition-2"><a href="#02Groups-PS-and-Nested-AE-Composition-2" class="headerlink" title="02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition"></a>02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition</h3><p>In Photoshop, you can group layers together and apply styles, blends, and transformations together. However, in After Effects, this is called Nesting.</p>
<p>Both are in a way similar to each other but Nesting Comps give users more functionality as it interprets probable compositions during the nesting process.</p>
<p>Smart objects used in PS are also comparable to Nested Comps as you can apply filters over one while applying effects to the other.</p>
<h3 id="03Vector-and-Shapes-2"><a href="#03Vector-and-Shapes-2" class="headerlink" title="03Vector and Shapes"></a>03Vector and Shapes</h3><p>You can use the Pen tool or Shape tool in both PS and AE that creates shape layers without losing any integrity. Both the applications support Bezier which lets you control curves between anchor points in PS and vertices in AE.</p>
<h3 id="04Destructive-Effects-2"><a href="#04Destructive-Effects-2" class="headerlink" title="04Destructive Effects"></a>04Destructive Effects</h3><p>After Effects does not provide you with destructive effects while in Photoshop you can apply non-destructive filters. You can also combine several layers to apply changes or distort your images but these permanent changes cannot be made in After Effects.</p>
<p>You will also notice that although there are several similarities, there are tools and features which are not shared between both applications. The types of tool categories would also vary. Like with After Effects, you can create paragraph and character styles that you can apply to texts.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-After-Effects-Gifs-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-After-Effects-Gifs-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs"></a>Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs</h2><p>After Effects harbors greater video editing capabilities rather than the basic animating options you can try on Photoshop. In creating a GIF, you would want to leverage the combination of tools offered on both After Effects and Photoshop.</p>
<p>Let’s first get into how you can create an animated video on After Effects and then convert it into an animated GIF in Photoshop.</p>
<h3 id="01Animating-in-After-Effects-2"><a href="#01Animating-in-After-Effects-2" class="headerlink" title="01Animating in After Effects"></a>01Animating in After Effects</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open After Effects, go to ‘Composition’ and create ‘New Composition’. You will need to fill out the dimensions and specs for your project on the window that pops up. For example, 300x250 px at 30 fps and 6 sec duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="new composition after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can import assets by dragging and dropping, or by going to the ‘Project Panel’ in the After Effects Workspace as shown in the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-2.jpg"
                      alt="project panel after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, you can begin animating your Assets. Drag them and add them to the ‘Composition’ panel or ‘Timeline’ panel. Placing them in either one will make them appear on both. Adjust the layers according to the topmost layer on the panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-3.jpg"
                      alt="timeline panel"
                ></p>
<p>Dial down the scale of every animation to 0% so that can be animated in a growing sequence. Select the layer you wish to adjust and click on ‘Transform’. Click on ‘Scale’ to give that layer an active marker on the timeline. Set the scale to 0%.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-4.jpg"
                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>You can now begin animating the first item by moving the current time indicator to 06f (the 6th frame on the 30fps timeline). Scale the item back to 100% and the marker will reappear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>Repeat this for the other items. Keep in mind that each item has a 06f space between them for later adjustability.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="repeat process"
                ></p>
<p>Your equation is now complete and all that is left to do is animate your CTA button. Adjust the position of the top layer on your CTA and set the current time indicator to start time on the button animation. Click on ‘position’ to set up a marker on your Timeline. Forward the 04f then nudge the button and reverse back to the original position so that it looks like a button clicking animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="set position"
                ></p>
<p>Your animation is now complete. Now go to ‘Composition’ and shorten the time in the ‘Duration’ panel.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go to Composition. Click on Pre-Render and a new selection will pop up. Now click on ‘Render’. Your output will be a .mov file.</p>

Now go to ‘File’ &gt; ‘Import’ &gt; ‘Frames to Layers’ and import the saved .mov file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import file photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you don’t automatically see the timeline, go to Windows &gt; Timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="timeline photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Decide on how many loops you want in your animation. Once you are done with your GIF, go to ‘File’ &gt; Export. Apply the Legacy Save for Web and choose the format for your GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-11.jpg"
                      alt="export and save as gif photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In Export options, you can gain access to several presets to apply to your animated GIFs. The more color displayed in your GIF, the larger its size. You can use Dethering to smoothen gradients and shades. Looping is also turned off on Photoshop but you can apply looping from the ‘Options’ shown at the bottom of the menu.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Ending-Thoughts-2"><a href="#Part-1-Ending-Thoughts-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Ending Thoughts"></a>Part 1 Ending Thoughts</h2><p><strong>●</strong> GIFs are a popular type of media that is quite trendy and easy to make using Adobe <strong>after effects gifs</strong> or Photoshop. They are called Graphics Interchange Format and are best used as simple graphic images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You require a combination of both Photoshop and After Effects, though both share similar interfaces, tools, and effects. You can group or nest compositions, apply filters or effects, and adjust vectors and shapes.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> After Effects is better than Photoshop in terms of creating videos, so you can first create a project in AE and then import the project onto PS after <strong>exporting after effects to gif</strong>. You can also use Filmora for the first step of this process.</p>

<p>GIFs have been around for quite some time but as the flow of content continues to plummet on popular social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, the demand for GIFs would continue to increase.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you won’t be able to <strong>make a gif in after effects</strong> directly, unless with the help of a plug-in like GIFGun.</p>
<p>Before moving forward, keep in mind that using Adobe Media Encoder is an easier method for compressing your exports rather than any third-party compressor.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>Repeat this for the other items. Keep in mind that each item has a 06f space between them for later adjustability.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="repeat process"
                ></p>
<p>Your equation is now complete and all that is left to do is animate your CTA button. Adjust the position of the top layer on your CTA and set the current time indicator to start time on the button animation. Click on ‘position’ to set up a marker on your Timeline. Forward the 04f then nudge the button and reverse back to the original position so that it looks like a button clicking animation.</p>

                      alt="set position"
                ></p>
<p>Your animation is now complete. Now go to ‘Composition’ and shorten the time in the ‘Duration’ panel.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go to Composition. Click on Pre-Render and a new selection will pop up. Now click on ‘Render’. Your output will be a .mov file.</p>

Now go to ‘File’ &gt; ‘Import’ &gt; ‘Frames to Layers’ and import the saved .mov file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import file photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you don’t automatically see the timeline, go to Windows &gt; Timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-10.jpg"
                      alt="timeline photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Decide on how many loops you want in your animation. Once you are done with your GIF, go to ‘File’ &gt; Export. Apply the Legacy Save for Web and choose the format for your GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-11.jpg"
                      alt="export and save as gif photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In Export options, you can gain access to several presets to apply to your animated GIFs. The more color displayed in your GIF, the larger its size. You can use Dethering to smoothen gradients and shades. Looping is also turned off on Photoshop but you can apply looping from the ‘Options’ shown at the bottom of the menu.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Ending-Thoughts-3"><a href="#Part-1-Ending-Thoughts-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Ending Thoughts"></a>Part 1 Ending Thoughts</h2><p><strong>●</strong> GIFs are a popular type of media that is quite trendy and easy to make using Adobe <strong>after effects gifs</strong> or Photoshop. They are called Graphics Interchange Format and are best used as simple graphic images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You require a combination of both Photoshop and After Effects, though both share similar interfaces, tools, and effects. You can group or nest compositions, apply filters or effects, and adjust vectors and shapes.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> After Effects is better than Photoshop in terms of creating videos, so you can first create a project in AE and then import the project onto PS after <strong>exporting after effects to gif</strong>. You can also use Filmora for the first step of this process.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Use-Rules-of-Thirds"><a href="#How-to-Use-Rules-of-Thirds" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Rules of Thirds"></a>How to Use Rules of Thirds</h2><p>So you have your work flow sorted out and you’re well on your way with Filmora but you’re not quite happy with your results or something just seems off when you watch your videos back. You may be missing an important element of all visual media and that’s composition. This is where the building blocks of every frame come together to make a visually pleasing piece for the viewer and helps the eyes concentrate on the content rather than trying to figure out what they are looking at.</p>
<p>I’m sure you may have heard of the rule of thirds for art or photography and you may not know or understand what it is. You may even be wondering how the rule of thirds can help you with your video creation. Well, that is what I’m going to show and explain to you today.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-the-rule-of-thirds"><a href="#What-is-the-rule-of-thirds" class="headerlink" title="What is the rule of thirds"></a>What is the rule of thirds</h2><p>At its core the rule of thirds is a guide to follow whenever you create something visual.</p>
<p>You break an image into thirds both horizontally and vertically, in doing this you are left with nine boxes and four gridlines, the rule states that by placing key elements in line with gridlines you will have an overall better composition.</p>
<p>To gain a better understanding of this here is a visual example of the gridlines and nine boxes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/rule-of-thirds-gridline.jpg"
                      alt="rule of thirds gridline"
                ></p>
<p>This may seem simple but is often overlooked due to time restraints and eagerness to get that video out there. By following these guidelines your overall composition will gain interesting and pleasing results that can help with viewer engagement. This is only one piece of the puzzle but as any photography professional or artist will tell you, It’s the small things that add up.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-use-the-rule-of-thirds"><a href="#How-to-use-the-rule-of-thirds" class="headerlink" title="How to use the rule of thirds"></a>How to use the rule of thirds</h2><p>To show how to use the rule of thirds I will be showing an image with and without the use of the guidelines. In doing this you will be able to see how impactful this system is and how it can help with your own creations within <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>This will be our scene example, you can see buildings, boats, water and skyline. This may be typical of a backdrop or an insert for a holiday picture amongst many other things.</p>
<p>I will now show this picture with no compositional thought and without the use of the thirds system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/shoot-a-scene-with-three-thirds.jpg"
                      alt="shoot a scene with three thirds"
                ></p>
<p>Notice how all the elements are in the scene but it just looks interesting and something just seems off when you look at it. You may find yourself searching for understanding of the image rather than taking the image in and concentrating on what the creator intended. This is seen commonly due to the need to fit every element in the scene but sometimes it is best to sacrifice something you may see as important for the sake of the whole picture.</p>
<p>We will now look at the example image with the rule of thirds in place and see if overall this makes a more interesting scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/place-thirds-points-in-photo.jpg"
                      alt="place thirds points in photo"
                ></p>
<p>We have aligned the skyline with the first horizontal grid line and aligned the boats with the vertical grid lines. We have sacrificed the crane in the scene but overall I’m sure you can agree that this is more pleasing and makes more sense when you’re viewing this. The whole middle section of the scene now has information within it and the contrast between the middle and the rest of the scene directs your eyes to what was intended to be viewed, This is called effect use of empty space. In doing this you save yourself time from adding more information to direct the viewer.</p>
<p>Placing key elements directly in the center of your scene can seem static and boring but by placing elements to one side or using the first and second horizontal grid lines you create something called Dynamism , where the viewer sees an element along the grid and takes a journey through the rest of the image.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that this is the humans natural way of viewing imagery, we first find something interesting to look at and then journey around that. So by using this rule you are creating a more natural process for your viewer.</p>
<h2 id="Tips-when-starting-using-the-rule-of-thirds"><a href="#Tips-when-starting-using-the-rule-of-thirds" class="headerlink" title="Tips when starting using the rule of thirds"></a>Tips when starting using the rule of thirds</h2><p>The first tip I would say is to view other videos, YouTube is a good starting point. Watch interviews and notice where the chairs are aligned. Watch reviewers and notice where they position themselves in the scene. Lastly watch movies and pause on an interesting scene and try to deconstruct where everything is placed and why they chose that composition.</p>
<p>The idea with the rule is to have it become something you do naturally, by always considering the form you save yourself time in the editing process. The key things you have in your mind whenever you make a scene should be.</p>
<p>1. What is the key element in my scene or what am I trying to make the viewer focus on.</p>
<p>2. where do I intend to place these in my scene?</p>
<p>3. Have I created a balanced scene with enough negative space to direct the eye.</p>
<p>If you consider this with every video you make then in time this will become as natural as drinking water on a hot day. As a practice you could open some old projects and apply this rule to your video to see the results and you may find yourself impressed with the change.</p>
<p><strong>When is it best to not use the rule of thirds?</strong></p>
<p>The rule is very useful when you’re aiming to grab the attention towards a certain element but that being said, when you have a symmetrical scene you can get away with not using the rule as your eyes can make sense of symmetry very well.</p>
<p>Even when working with a symmetrical scene you can incorporate the rule within for elements such as people or key figures but in this situation it is down to the creator to figure what they feel is best in any given shot.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Use-Rule-of-Thirds-in-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Use-Rule-of-Thirds-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Rule of Thirds in Filmora"></a>How to Use Rule of Thirds in Filmora</h2><p>The tools provided within Filmora are generous and one great feature is the crop and size tool.</p>
<p>When inserting an image or movie file you can right click on the timeline and select crop and size bringing up a handy screen with the gridlines already there for you. It’s just a matter of aligning your shot for the best composition.</p>
<p>For reference I will show you what this looks like.</p>
<p>First right click the timeline on the image you want to reposition. Alternatively you can select the desired insert and press Alt+C this will also bring up the same editing box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/crop-rule-of-thirds-video.jpg"
                      alt="crop rule of thirds video"
                ></p>
<p>Now click on the crop and zoom option and this editor will appear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/crop-rule-of-thirds-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="crop rule of thirds filmora"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see you are able to align the shot and change the aspect ratio to align with your project. For a better look at the built in grid lines see image below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rule of thirds final video"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>To conclude, the rule of thirds is very important within visual media and is tough within the fundamentals of art and photography from beginner level right up to the highest point of education, Practice thinking about your placement of key elements within your videos and how this affects your overall composition. The goal is to have this as an automatic thought when shooting your videos or still images. This is a small change you can make but has a big impact on how a viewer engages your content and in return leaves a positive opinion towards your creativity and eye for detail.</p>

            <h2 id="Easy-Way-to-Create-a-DIY-Green-Screen-Video-Effect"><a href="#Easy-Way-to-Create-a-DIY-Green-Screen-Video-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Easy Way to Create a DIY Green Screen Video Effect"></a>Easy Way to Create a DIY Green Screen Video Effect</h2><p>No matter how big the budget of a Hollywood movie is, at the end of the day, it has to rely on the humble green screens for special video effects. The stunning studios from where your favorite YouTubers and gamers stream their videos are graphical video effects created through green screens. Even the studios that you see on TV channels are a graphical creation of green screens. You must be wondering how they could achieve such awesome graphics with a simple green screen.</p>
<p>All you need is a good-quality green fabric, a professional video editing software, and a camera. You may not believe it, but that is all you need for creating DIY green screen video effect. You do not have to be a professional video editor to edit the green screen on your videos and add any special video effect. In this article, you will learn how to create your own DIY green backdrop.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Green-Screen-Technique"><a href="#What-Is-Green-Screen-Technique" class="headerlink" title="What Is Green Screen Technique?"></a>What Is Green Screen Technique?</h2><p>A green screen is nothing but a green fabric. In a video, a green screen is placed in the background behind the subject. In the editing phase of the video, the green screen is replaced with any background image or video effect that stays intact in the video as long as possible. In short, the green screen technique involves superimposing photos and videos on the green screen in a video.</p>
<p>Starting from the video game industry, movie industry to video streaming and TV channels, the green screen technique is used everywhere. The stunning graphical component of these industries is totally dependent on the green screen technique. In fact, DIY green screen for zoom meetings and video conferencing is widely used. Along with that, YouTubers and Twitch streamers use DIY green screen for streaming live.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, instead of a green screen, you can use any other color of screen. However, green screens are widely used, and it has become a norm. The main point to remember when using a green screen is that nothing else should have green color such as the dresses the subject is wearing. Therefore, in technical terms, the green screen is referred to as Chroma Key, and you will find Chroma Key option instead of green screen in most video editors.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Use-Green-Screen-Technique"><a href="#Why-Use-Green-Screen-Technique" class="headerlink" title="Why Use Green Screen Technique?"></a>Why Use Green Screen Technique?</h2><p>The main reason why the green screen technique is used in movie and video making is that the video editor can replace the entire background at once instead of replacing the background frame by frame. Once you replace a green screen with an image or video effect, it stays the same throughout the video as long as required.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video editor can save a lot of time in editing and the editing stays uniform throughout which gives a realistic effect. If the green screen technique is not used and editing is done frame by frame of a video, there could be a manual error, inconsistent, and graphical glitches.</p>
<p>You can replace green screens with anything you want. It could be a still image of a beautiful studio with 3D effect like you see in case of YouTubers and gamers. It could be a moving, real-life landscape on any place in the world instead of a beautiful background picture. Similarly, it could be replaced by video effects such as explosions, stadiums full of people, battlefields, and likewise. At times, it could be live animations as you see on TV channels.</p>
<h2 id="How-To-Create-DIY-Green-Screen-Stand-Setup-and-Add-Green-Screen-Effect"><a href="#How-To-Create-DIY-Green-Screen-Stand-Setup-and-Add-Green-Screen-Effect" class="headerlink" title="How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?"></a>How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?</h2><p>If you want to have a green screen setup for your video, you need to have the following things ready.</p>
<ul>
<li>A green cloth that is large enough to cover the entire background.</li>
<li>A video editing software to replace green screen in your video with anything.</li>
<li>External light for more video clarity and a good camera with mic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1: Setup DIY Green Backdrop</p>
<p>Your green fabric should be soft and bright. If you are going to be the subject of the video, make sure you are not wearing anything green. Moreover, do not keep any object within the video frame that is green in color. If there are too many green objects, you can use a blue screen.</p>
<p>When it comes to hanging the green cloth in the background, people find it very difficult. If your video frame is going to be a close-up to the subject, you can use a green screen panel to hang green cloth. A green screen panel generally has a collapsible structure for easy storage and transportation.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you need to install hooks in the wall if you are planning to replace the green screen with a studio-like scene so that the entire background of the video frame stays covered with green screen. You should opt for multiple green screens and stitch them together to cover the background completely.</p>
<p>Step 2: Setup Camera and Light</p>
<p>Whether you are shooting with a DSLR camera or smartphone camera or webcam, make sure you are shooting at least HD video quality so that the editing could be great. Lights are important when you are using green screen though they are not a necessity. The video quality and brightness get enhanced with lights. Diffused lights work the best and the background should be well-lit.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you have to place the lights in such a way that your body arms should not be casting any shadow on the green screen. You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.</p>
<p>Step 3: Get The Best Video Editor For Green Screen Effect</p>
<p>There are various video editors available, but not all of them are suitable for green screen effect. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best video editor to apply green screen effects on your video while editing.

If You’re Looking to Edit Recorded Video with a Pro-Level Editing Then We’ve Got You Covered. Learn About Editing Recorded Videos with the Best Toolkit Here</h2><p>The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don’t need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.</p>
<p>Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you’re on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don’t have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we’ve put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you’ll need to know to make stunning films, even if you’ve never done it before. We’ll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS"></a><strong>Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS</strong></h2><p>OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It’s open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Download and Install OBS</strong></p>
<p>Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Setup Screen Recording</strong></p>
<p>The window is divided into separate parts called “docks” when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you’ll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="obs setup screen recording"
                ></p>
<p>You’ll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Customize the Recording Source</strong></p>
<p>You’ll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select “Display Capture” by clicking the “+” icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click “OK”. At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you’re ready to begin recording. When you’re finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.</p>

<p>Congratulations on getting here! You finally cropped your video using the VLC media player.</p>
<p>Although there are disadvantages to using this as your cropping tool. Like for example you want the real-time preview of what you’ve changed in your video. This would be a turn off for some that want their outputs to be shown to them immediately. Aside from this, there is a chance that you will forget one step to make and thus, the whole process would need to start over from scratch. Lastly, is the freedom to batch crop multiple videos. This is especially important for those that need to have many clips in one video. A user might lose the continuity of the story within his video.</p>
<p>While one of its strong suits is the affordability of the software. It is completely free and has no additional charges that may surprise you in the future. Finally, your output won’t have watermarks that could destroy the aesthetics of your video.</p>
<p>What are your experiences with using it as a cropping tool? What would you recommend to improve it? It is up to you the user if you want to continue using this as your partner in removing the excess in your videos.</p>

<p>Congratulations on getting here! You finally cropped your video using the VLC media player.</p>
<p>Although there are disadvantages to using this as your cropping tool. Like for example you want the real-time preview of what you’ve changed in your video. This would be a turn off for some that want their outputs to be shown to them immediately. Aside from this, there is a chance that you will forget one step to make and thus, the whole process would need to start over from scratch. Lastly, is the freedom to batch crop multiple videos. This is especially important for those that need to have many clips in one video. A user might lose the continuity of the story within his video.</p>
<p>While one of its strong suits is the affordability of the software. It is completely free and has no additional charges that may surprise you in the future. Finally, your output won’t have watermarks that could destroy the aesthetics of your video.</p>
<p>What are your experiences with using it as a cropping tool? What would you recommend to improve it? It is up to you the user if you want to continue using this as your partner in removing the excess in your videos.</p>

As an Added Bonus, We Have Also Included the Method to Perform the Same Actions in WonderShare Filmora</h2><p>Video Editing is an art form dependent on various elements and factors that are part of your video; this means people, items, or objects in the background can often make or break the viewing experience.</p>
<p>Can you imagine having shot a scene with impeccable attention to detail, but a small uncontrollable action leaves a portion of an unwanted cable or equipment in the frame? Bummer, right? But luckily, due to the power of video editing software, it is not hard to deal with such problems.</p>
<p>A way to work with such clips is to use the crop function while editing, as it can help emphasize or detract attention from a particular part of any video project.</p>
<p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> While filming, try to capture footage in the highest resolution allowed by the available camera hardware; this will give you more room to play with while using the crop function.</p>
<p>To preface, CyberLink PowerDirector is a free video editing tool capable of accomplishing this and providing a professional touch to your video projects. And like other competing software, the program not only allows you to crop into clips but also uses keyframes to modify aspects like panning and zoom. So to help you perform this action, in this article, we list the steps you will need for cropping into video clips with PowerDirector. As an added bonus, we have also included the method to perform the same actions in WonderShare Filmora.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>We documented the steps in this guide with PowerDirector 365 and WonderShare Filmora X.</em></p>

<p><em>If you do not already have CyberLink PowerDirector 365, download the software by visiting</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FIN.html"><em>Cyberlink’s official website</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a new video project in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 by choosing Full Mode.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 provides access to a full-featured video editing tool, similar to Wondershare Filmora. The other available options cater to distinct video types.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library; in this guide, we have gone ahead and used the pre-existing stock footage.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video toolbar giving you access to the various controls built into PowerDirector 365. Hover over the tools open, following which you need to click on the Crop, Zoom, and Pan option.</p>

<p>This action will crop the video clip according to your desired size.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>:</p>
<p>The activation of Keyframes while cropping will allow you to create an effect that slowly zooms into the footage. To do this, set Keyframe Point 1 at a specific time (say the fifth second) and at one zoom level (say zero) and create Keyframe Point 2 at another time (fifteenth second) and a different zoom level (say fifty). So, between the fifth second and fifteenth second, the zoom will steadily increase and raise emphasis on an object. You can also add an element of position to this action if you want the focus to be on something not in the center of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Keyframes while Video Editing is a software-based feature that allows you to set In and Out Points, giving clips between the two positions different properties that change as the playhead continues to move. These properties can be increased zoom, rotation, different colors, or even a gradual pan.</p>
<p>We recommend experimenting with this feature if you want to bring a more dynamic feeling to your video project.</p>

<p>Once you have the software open, follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import the Media File into your Video Project.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose the Crop Options (marked in Red) to open the Crop window.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick any edge within the visible box and resize them to select the portion you want to keep in the clip.</p>

<p>And Wondershare Filmora does just that with its modern iconography and increased accessibility. With its thoughtful, less-frills approach, Filmora is the one to pick if you do not want to be bogged down by needless menus and have to hunt for actions that will help you create a video that you would want to watch yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 provides access to a full-featured video editing tool, similar to Wondershare Filmora. The other available options cater to distinct video types.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library; in this guide, we have gone ahead and used the pre-existing stock footage.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video toolbar giving you access to the various controls built into PowerDirector 365. Hover over the tools open, following which you need to click on the Crop, Zoom, and Pan option.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick either corner of the frame visible around the video and set the area you want the clip to focus upon; following this, click Save.</p>

<h2 id="An-Easier-Way-to-Crop-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#An-Easier-Way-to-Crop-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="An Easier Way to Crop Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a><strong>An Easier Way to Crop Video with Wondershare Filmora</strong></h2><p>While Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 is a powerful video editing tool, in our experience, its menus are not as simple to navigate as some of the other competing video editing tools available, Wondershare <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> included.</p>
<p>An emphasis on quick accessibility is present with Filmora, and we believe this is a huge plus for beginning creators. The use of iconography resemblant to mobile software is another aspect that helps increase familiarity.</p>
<p><em>If you do not already have Wondershare Filmora, you can download the software by visiting the official website.</em></p>
<p>Now, to help you learn how to use the Crop Tool and to show you an example of what we mean, here is how you can use the feature Wondershare Filmora to get the desired output.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p>Once you have the software open, follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import the Media File into your Video Project.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Drag the clip onto the Timeline and then select it to activate further interactions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose the Crop Options (marked in Red) to open the Crop window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-7.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick any edge within the visible box and resize them to select the portion you want to keep in the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-8.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p>Having read this bit of the guide, we believe you may have noticed how Filmora is more convenient due to the easier access it provides to the crop function.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-7"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-7" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>So, at the end of the day, both software listed in this article are fully functional and highly-capable video editing tools, but saving time spent in front of the computer is a huge factor for any video editor.</p>
<p>And Wondershare Filmora does just that with its modern iconography and increased accessibility. With its thoughtful, less-frills approach, Filmora is the one to pick if you do not want to be bogged down by needless menus and have to hunt for actions that will help you create a video that you would want to watch yourself.</p>

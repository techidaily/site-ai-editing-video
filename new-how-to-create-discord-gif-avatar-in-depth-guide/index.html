<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>It is suitable for gaming communication:</strong> Discord is primarily popular among gamers. The platform is new, but it has quickly overtaken its competitors, Skype and TeamSpeak. Why? Many gamers consider it a revolutionized application that solves all their worries making gaming communication bigger and better. Before Discord, gaming communication was difficult and dangerous. After all, you need to share personal Skype details that connect with your phone, making it a not-safe option. When we consider TeamSpeak, you realize that it is limiting with the option available since you only have a voice call. Discord brings out the best network channel; gamers and friends have quickly started using it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Most services are free: Discord includes multiple benefits that make</strong> communication straightforward and convenient. Luckily, most of the services available are free, meaning that almost everyone can access them.

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>It rarely includes ads in private chats:</strong> A platform can become frustrating, mainly when it features multiple ads every minute. However, Discord is different since it almost has no ads. Therefore, people can freely chat with friends and other gamers.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Discord is safe:</strong> The settings under Discord are safe since they include suitable privacy options and monitoring. Thus, it is a safe option. But many people often raise the question of open chatting in apps and the security issues that come with them. Many people can confirm that Discord is a safe option and if you feel otherwise, ensure that you only add friends you know.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Discord-Emojis"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Discord-Emojis" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?"></a>Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?</h2><p>From the information above, you can tell that Discord’s primary role is communication.

Of course, they are useless for formal communication, but Discord holds a considerable weight for various issues.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>They are fun and exciting</strong>. Sometimes you can choose to use an emoji instead of writing some phrase, and this option works for all. Besides, it feels good to see different emojis instead of a long paragraph that tells the same story.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Emojis make communication easy</strong>. We are in the 21st century with multiple revolutionary changes with our communication channels. Young people prefer emojis for different conversations.</p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

<p>In the menu on the left, you can choose the format of the finished video (choose 1: 1 (square)), whether to crop the video (choose Fit to Border), and the length.</p>

<p>Drag both ends of the layer to change the timing of the start and end of the clip, or click the timing and use the arrow keys to make fine adjustments.</p>
<p>Besides trimming, you can look at other edits. To remove a section or add a clip in the center, use the split tool above the timeline or type “s” on your keyboard and use the shortcut.</p>
<p>Next, delete the layers you no longer need, drag the clips to combine them, and display them side by side on the timeline.</p>
<p> creators have more control over the montage by editing the scene in Studio. In Studio, you can add music to your montage,</p>
<p> insert title slides, attach endings, watermark corners, and animate.</p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This will open a video editor and ask you to select a format.</p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

You know, those cool shake effects that you may have seen on an amateur or professional video on the web? Well, if you have, then you probably thought it was impossible. The camera shake effect is a technique applied to the clips where shaky camera movements cause the image to appear more cinematic and real. Applying a camera shake effect is to hide your flaws when shooting a video.</p>
<p>Camera shake is often mistaken for poor cinematography. It can enhance your video. For instance, if you’re filming something like a car chase or any other scene where there’s lots of movement and action, the inclusion of a camera shake can help make it more realistic.</p>
<p>A camera shake effect can be an excellent way of adding a sense of realism to your videos. Whether you’re making a video that’s meant to be taken as a real scene, such as one depicting a robbery, or one that’s supposed to be shot in a documentary style, such as making a movie, you can use this as an effective tool. You can consider adding camera shakes to your videos due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This camera shake effect makes your video more creative. If you want to make, your video different from those other businesses produce, adding this effect will be a good idea.</li>
<li>Your audience will be able to relate better to your video if they’ve seen similar videos before.</li>
<li>Adding a camera shake to your video will make it more interesting and engaging for your viewers.</li>
<li>It’s a great way to mask any mistakes you might have made during the video production. After all, we aren’t perfect humans, so we can’t make perfect videos every time!”</li>
<li>You can use camera shakes to simulate the feeling of being in an environment that is free from control (such as being on a boat).</li>
<li>You can use them to create a sense of urgency for the viewer&#x2F;audience by adding motion blur to the sequence.</li>

Using it correctly can add subtle motion to a static frame, emphasize an important object, and even make a character quiver in fear! In this tutorial, you will learn how to effectively use the wiggle expression to affect a layer throughout the Composition.</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-Select-the-layer-you-want-to-shake-from-your-After-Effects-file"><a href="#Step-1-Select-the-layer-you-want-to-shake-from-your-After-Effects-file" class="headerlink" title="Step 1.

Select the layer you want to shake from your After Effects file</h3><p>Suppose you have an image or video of an object and want to apply it to shake effect, then it is quite easy. Just follow the steps described below.</p>

Press the alt&#x2F;option key, then click the stopwatch next to “position.”</h3><p>You are adding an “expression” to the timeline when the position text turns red, and you begin typing. Using a coding language adapted from javascript, you can apply complex motion to layers.</p>
<p>By pressing the alt&#x2F;option again on the stopwatch, you can edit your expression anytime-or by clicking the arrow beside “position” and then double-clicking the text in the timeline.</p>

Enter “Wiggle (3,8)” and adjust the settings accordingly"></a>Step 3. Enter “Wiggle (3,8)” and adjust the settings accordingly</h3><p>In this expression, the first number indicates the frequency of Wiggle – basically, how quickly it appears to tremble. Its amplitude is the second number, which indicates how far it moves. The numbers are adjustable as you wish. Layers will shake dramatically but slowly when they use Wiggle (2,40). The “Wiggle (10,3)” command makes a layer move quickly without too much movement in one direction.</p>
<h3 id="Step-4-Adjust-the-frame-rate-of-your-Composition"><a href="#Step-4-Adjust-the-frame-rate-of-your-Composition" class="headerlink" title="Step 4. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition"></a>Step 4. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition</h3><p>In order to make the overall effect more “choppy,” you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition&gt; Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as “8” if you want a choppy feel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Your entire Composition will become choppier if you reduce the frame rate, so it might not be worth it if you have other moving elements in your Composition. Only adjust the frame rate of the layer containing the wiggling object if you want it to affect that layer.</p>

You know, those cool shake effects that you may have seen on an amateur or professional video on the web? Well, if you have, then you probably thought it was impossible. The camera shake effect is a technique applied to the clips where shaky camera movements cause the image to appear more cinematic and real. Applying a camera shake effect is to hide your flaws when shooting a video.</p>
<p>Camera shake is often mistaken for poor cinematography. It can enhance your video. For instance, if you’re filming something like a car chase or any other scene where there’s lots of movement and action, the inclusion of a camera shake can help make it more realistic.</p>
<p>A camera shake effect can be an excellent way of adding a sense of realism to your videos. Whether you’re making a video that’s meant to be taken as a real scene, such as one depicting a robbery, or one that’s supposed to be shot in a documentary style, such as making a movie, you can use this as an effective tool. You can consider adding camera shakes to your videos due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This camera shake effect makes your video more creative. If you want to make, your video different from those other businesses produce, adding this effect will be a good idea.</li>
<li>Your audience will be able to relate better to your video if they’ve seen similar videos before.</li>
<li>Adding a camera shake to your video will make it more interesting and engaging for your viewers.</li>
<li>It’s a great way to mask any mistakes you might have made during the video production. After all, we aren’t perfect humans, so we can’t make perfect videos every time!”</li>
<li>You can use camera shakes to simulate the feeling of being in an environment that is free from control (such as being on a boat).</li>
<li>You can use them to create a sense of urgency for the viewer&#x2F;audience by adding motion blur to the sequence.</li>

Using it correctly can add subtle motion to a static frame, emphasize an important object, and even make a character quiver in fear! In this tutorial, you will learn how to effectively use the wiggle expression to affect a layer throughout the Composition.</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-Select-the-layer-you-want-to-shake-from-your-After-Effects-file-2"><a href="#Step-1-Select-the-layer-you-want-to-shake-from-your-After-Effects-file-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Select the layer you want to shake from your After Effects file"></a>Step 1. Select the layer you want to shake from your After Effects file</h3><p>Suppose you have an image or video of an object and want to apply it to shake effect, then it is quite easy. Just follow the steps described below.</p>

Press the alt&#x2F;option key, then click the stopwatch next to “position.”"></a>Step 2. Press the alt&#x2F;option key, then click the stopwatch next to “position.”</h3><p>You are adding an “expression” to the timeline when the position text turns red, and you begin typing. Using a coding language adapted from javascript, you can apply complex motion to layers.</p>
<p>By pressing the alt&#x2F;option again on the stopwatch, you can edit your expression anytime-or by clicking the arrow beside “position” and then double-clicking the text in the timeline.</p>

Enter “Wiggle (3,8)” and adjust the settings accordingly"></a>Step 3. Enter “Wiggle (3,8)” and adjust the settings accordingly</h3><p>In this expression, the first number indicates the frequency of Wiggle – basically, how quickly it appears to tremble. Its amplitude is the second number, which indicates how far it moves. The numbers are adjustable as you wish. Layers will shake dramatically but slowly when they use Wiggle (2,40). The “Wiggle (10,3)” command makes a layer move quickly without too much movement in one direction.</p>
<h3 id="Step-4-Adjust-the-frame-rate-of-your-Composition-2"><a href="#Step-4-Adjust-the-frame-rate-of-your-Composition-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 4. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition"></a>Step 4. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition</h3><p>In order to make the overall effect more “choppy,” you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition&gt; Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as “8” if you want a choppy feel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Your entire Composition will become choppier if you reduce the frame rate, so it might not be worth it if you have other moving elements in your Composition. Only adjust the frame rate of the layer containing the wiggling object if you want it to affect that layer.</p>

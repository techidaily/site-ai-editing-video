Below are some essential things to think about bringing perfection in slow-motion videos:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resolution</strong>: A slow-motion video with visual appeal and a high resolution is crucial. This is especially vital if you intend to crop or zoom in on the video while editing.</li>
<li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Make sure the slow-motion clip supports the idea you’re attempting to portray. Your scenes will have more impact if you tell them with a thoughtful narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Editing:</strong> Try different speeds when editing your clip to achieve the best impact. Consider including sound effects or music to accompany the slow-motion images.</li>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> Select the appropriate times to record in slow motion. You shouldn’t slow down your entire video. Instead, you can apply the effect to draw attention to acts or feelings.</li>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> Slow-motion videos are usually shot at a greater frame rate. Frame rates of 60, 120, 240, or even higher are common as they make the video look smoother.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> For precise and sharp results, use a fast shutter speed camera. This lessens the likelihood of motion blur in every slow-motion frame.</li>
</ul>

Below are some essential things to think about bringing perfection in slow-motion videos:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resolution</strong>: A slow-motion video with visual appeal and a high resolution is crucial. This is especially vital if you intend to crop or zoom in on the video while editing.</li>
<li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Make sure the slow-motion clip supports the idea you’re attempting to portray. Your scenes will have more impact if you tell them with a thoughtful narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Editing:</strong> Try different speeds when editing your clip to achieve the best impact. Consider including sound effects or music to accompany the slow-motion images.</li>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> Select the appropriate times to record in slow motion. You shouldn’t slow down your entire video. Instead, you can apply the effect to draw attention to acts or feelings.</li>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> Slow-motion videos are usually shot at a greater frame rate. Frame rates of 60, 120, 240, or even higher are common as they make the video look smoother.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> For precise and sharp results, use a fast shutter speed camera. This lessens the likelihood of motion blur in every slow-motion frame.</li>
</ul>

Of course, each artist’s ability differs, and so does art as well, but to start out, you do not need much. You need, though, careful planning and knowing the exact scale of your art.</p>
<p>You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like"><a href="#1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose an image that you like"></a>1. Choose an image that you like</h3><p>It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.</p>
<h3 id="2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections"><a href="#2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections" class="headerlink" title="2. Break the image down into single-color sections"></a>2. Break the image down into single-color sections</h3><p>This is the part where “careful planning” comes in. You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.</p>
<h3 id="3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources"><a href="#3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources" class="headerlink" title="3. Obtain the necessary resources"></a>3. Obtain the necessary resources</h3><p>You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="4-Start-building"><a href="#4-Start-building" class="headerlink" title="4. Start building"></a>4. Start building</h3><p>Now you can start building your masterpiece. Start with the foundation and build from there; although you can virtually start anywhere, these blocks can float, unlike art or buildings outside the game. The time the process takes depends on the amount of work that needs to be done and the piece’s complexity.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-Tips-for-Creating-a-Wonderful-Minecraft-Pixel-Art"><a href="#Part-5-Tips-for-Creating-a-Wonderful-Minecraft-Pixel-Art" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Tips for Creating a Wonderful Minecraft Pixel Art"></a>Part 5: Tips for Creating a Wonderful Minecraft Pixel Art</h2><p>There are many ways to draw Minecraft pixel art, but here are some tips to help you out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a clear idea of what kind of art you want to do. And start with something pre-made if you are only starting out. It is extremely hard to start something from scratch.</li>
<li>Plan the pixel art you are going to do. Gather around all the block materials and colors that you’ll need to make your pixel art.</li>
<li>Use creative mode. Because with the creative mode, you are not limited to the number of blocks you can find, and also, no one can come and destroy your art.</li>
<li>If it is easier, you can first draft your pixel art on another app to help you map out your own project.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Minecraft pixel art is a growing trend in the video games world. It can range from easy and accessible to beginners to extremely complicated pieces of art. Players are becoming more engaged with this type of art in-game, and the future only predicts a bigger expansion. There are several tools that you can use to start out in your pixel art, as well as many tutorials.</p>

Of course, each artist’s ability differs, and so does art as well, but to start out, you do not need much. You need, though, careful planning and knowing the exact scale of your art.</p>
<p>You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like-1"><a href="#1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose an image that you like"></a>1. Choose an image that you like</h3><p>It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.</p>
<h3 id="2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections-1"><a href="#2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.</p>
<h3 id="3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources-1"><a href="#3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Obtain the necessary resources"></a>3. Obtain the necessary resources</h3><p>You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="4-Start-building-1"><a href="#4-Start-building-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Start building"></a>4. Start building</h3><p>Now you can start building your masterpiece.

<li>Use creative mode. Because with the creative mode, you are not limited to the number of blocks you can find, and also, no one can come and destroy your art.</li>
<li>If it is easier, you can first draft your pixel art on another app to help you map out your own project.</li>

Of course, each artist’s ability differs, and so does art as well, but to start out, you do not need much. You need, though, careful planning and knowing the exact scale of your art.</p>
<p>You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like-3"><a href="#1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose an image that you like"></a>1. Choose an image that you like</h3><p>It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.</p>
<h3 id="2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections-3"><a href="#2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Break the image down into single-color sections"></a>2. Break the image down into single-color sections</h3><p>This is the part where “careful planning” comes in. You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.</p>
<h3 id="3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources-3"><a href="#3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Obtain the necessary resources"></a>3. Obtain the necessary resources</h3><p>You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="4-Start-building-3"><a href="#4-Start-building-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Start building"></a>4. Start building</h3><p>Now you can start building your masterpiece. Start with the foundation and build from there; although you can virtually start anywhere, these blocks can float, unlike art or buildings outside the game. The time the process takes depends on the amount of work that needs to be done and the piece’s complexity.</p>

<ul>
<li>Have a clear idea of what kind of art you want to do. And start with something pre-made if you are only starting out. It is extremely hard to start something from scratch.</li>
<li>Plan the pixel art you are going to do. Gather around all the block materials and colors that you’ll need to make your pixel art.</li>
<li>Use creative mode. Because with the creative mode, you are not limited to the number of blocks you can find, and also, no one can come and destroy your art.</li>
<li>If it is easier, you can first draft your pixel art on another app to help you map out your own project.</li>
</ul>

A green colored indicative light will mark the spot where the images are being dropped. You are free to drop all the images at the same time and sort them at a later stage. Do not close the image folder in your device until you have imported all the stills.</p>
<p>The images can be alternatively added to the timeline by selecting the required ones from the iOS device’s Photo Booth or iPhoto account.

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Adjust Image Pans and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Having included the desired images within the slideshow project, it is now time to improvise them with classic and enhanced looks. You can adhere to the task by making suitable changes under the ‘Video Adjustments’, ‘Crop Tool’ and ‘Clock’ options. Drag the cursor to a desired slide to see all the 3 options pop up at the top your slide screen.</p>

                      alt="iMovie Slideshow Creator- Making Image Pan and Transition Adjustments"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Video Adjustment Tool</strong></p>
<p>Using the ‘Video Adjustment’ option, you are granted the liberty to adjust the brightness, contrast, white point, exposure, saturation and levels of the added images. If your images have an appreciable quality by default, you can skip this step.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Crop Tool</strong></p>
<p>Consider working with the ‘Crop Tool’ to zoom or pan the system camera across a selected slide. Click on the ‘Fit’ option to set the image within a chosen frame size; however you need to be cautious lest using the tool may render an incorrectly cropped image. Select the ‘Crop’ option to adjust the image aspect ratio according to your specific size constraints.</p>
<p>The ‘Ken Burns’ tool, you can rely on this one to spark the slideshow images with the coolest zoom and pan effects. The tool is represented by ‘Red and Green’ boxes above the ‘Video Preview’ box in the editor timeline. You can easily move and resize the boxes using the ‘Hand’ and the ‘Cross Hair’ tools respectively. When you are satisfied with your work, hit ‘Done’ to return and confirm the changes, or click on the next presentation slide to crop and pan the same.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Clock Tool</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Clock’ icon lets you adjust the screen time of each slide, assigning a preset minimum duration of 0.25 seconds to each slide. Setting a play duration somewhere between 2-2.5 seconds would be an optimal choice. Avoid choosing shorter slide duration unless it becomes an obvious requirement, lest the audience may find it hard to process the contents.</p>
<p>Prefer adjusting the screen time separately for each slide, in case you have a large project with more than 50 slides. It is instead, advisable to time the entire project under one time frame, while setting a longer screen time for the title slide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add an Upbeat Background Audio</strong></p>
<p>Adding background music to your presentation slides is pretty simple, with you having to just position the audio files within the desired slides using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. The slides containing music pieces will have a ‘Light Green’ highlighting box under them. To correct a wrong placement, drag the audio file across the individual slides and drop at the correct space. You can further, modify the length of the audio clips by extending and trimming them.</p>
<p>To import audio files from your online iTunes account, navigate to and click within the ‘Music and Sound Effects’ box at the bottom right corner of the editor timeline. You can also clip the music file to start playing the background audio from a certain point within the track. To do this, take the cursor to the end of the track and drag the red indicator line to the point where you wish the audio to end at or begin playing from.</p>

                ></p>

When all looks good, navigate to the ‘Functions Toolbar’ at the top and hit the ‘Share’ tab to select a media sharing platform of your choice. You can even choose to export your slideshow directly from the editor timeline via QuickTime.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Include Still Images</strong></p>

A green colored indicative light will mark the spot where the images are being dropped. You are free to drop all the images at the same time and sort them at a later stage. Do not close the image folder in your device until you have imported all the stills.</p>
<p>The images can be alternatively added to the timeline by selecting the required ones from the iOS device’s Photo Booth or iPhoto account. All you need to do is navigate to and hit the ‘Photo’ button to drop the selected images in the ‘Photos’ box at the bottom right corner of the software workspace.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Adjust Image Pans and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Having included the desired images within the slideshow project, it is now time to improvise them with classic and enhanced looks. You can adhere to the task by making suitable changes under the ‘Video Adjustments’, ‘Crop Tool’ and ‘Clock’ options. Drag the cursor to a desired slide to see all the 3 options pop up at the top your slide screen.</p>

                      alt="iMovie Slideshow Creator- Making Image Pan and Transition Adjustments"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Video Adjustment Tool</strong></p>
<p>Using the ‘Video Adjustment’ option, you are granted the liberty to adjust the brightness, contrast, white point, exposure, saturation and levels of the added images. If your images have an appreciable quality by default, you can skip this step.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Crop Tool</strong></p>
<p>Consider working with the ‘Crop Tool’ to zoom or pan the system camera across a selected slide. Click on the ‘Fit’ option to set the image within a chosen frame size; however you need to be cautious lest using the tool may render an incorrectly cropped image. Select the ‘Crop’ option to adjust the image aspect ratio according to your specific size constraints.</p>
<p>The ‘Ken Burns’ tool, you can rely on this one to spark the slideshow images with the coolest zoom and pan effects. The tool is represented by ‘Red and Green’ boxes above the ‘Video Preview’ box in the editor timeline. You can easily move and resize the boxes using the ‘Hand’ and the ‘Cross Hair’ tools respectively. When you are satisfied with your work, hit ‘Done’ to return and confirm the changes, or click on the next presentation slide to crop and pan the same.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Clock Tool</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Clock’ icon lets you adjust the screen time of each slide, assigning a preset minimum duration of 0.25 seconds to each slide. Setting a play duration somewhere between 2-2.5 seconds would be an optimal choice. Avoid choosing shorter slide duration unless it becomes an obvious requirement, lest the audience may find it hard to process the contents.</p>
<p>Prefer adjusting the screen time separately for each slide, in case you have a large project with more than 50 slides. It is instead, advisable to time the entire project under one time frame, while setting a longer screen time for the title slide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add an Upbeat Background Audio</strong></p>
<p>Adding background music to your presentation slides is pretty simple, with you having to just position the audio files within the desired slides using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. The slides containing music pieces will have a ‘Light Green’ highlighting box under them. To correct a wrong placement, drag the audio file across the individual slides and drop at the correct space. You can further, modify the length of the audio clips by extending and trimming them.</p>
<p>To import audio files from your online iTunes account, navigate to and click within the ‘Music and Sound Effects’ box at the bottom right corner of the editor timeline. You can also clip the music file to start playing the background audio from a certain point within the track. To do this, take the cursor to the end of the track and drag the red indicator line to the point where you wish the audio to end at or begin playing from.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Share Your Presentation</strong></p>
<p>Run a mock slideshow in the ‘Preview’ box to ensure that every element of the presentation is at its specified place. When all looks good, navigate to the ‘Functions Toolbar’ at the top and hit the ‘Share’ tab to select a media sharing platform of your choice. You can even choose to export your slideshow directly from the editor timeline via QuickTime.</p>

A green colored indicative light will mark the spot where the images are being dropped. You are free to drop all the images at the same time and sort them at a later stage.

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Adjust Image Pans and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Having included the desired images within the slideshow project, it is now time to improvise them with classic and enhanced looks. You can adhere to the task by making suitable changes under the ‘Video Adjustments’, ‘Crop Tool’ and ‘Clock’ options. Drag the cursor to a desired slide to see all the 3 options pop up at the top your slide screen.</p>

                      alt="iMovie Slideshow Creator- Making Image Pan and Transition Adjustments"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Video Adjustment Tool</strong></p>
<p>Using the ‘Video Adjustment’ option, you are granted the liberty to adjust the brightness, contrast, white point, exposure, saturation and levels of the added images. If your images have an appreciable quality by default, you can skip this step.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Crop Tool</strong></p>
<p>Consider working with the ‘Crop Tool’ to zoom or pan the system camera across a selected slide. Click on the ‘Fit’ option to set the image within a chosen frame size; however you need to be cautious lest using the tool may render an incorrectly cropped image. Select the ‘Crop’ option to adjust the image aspect ratio according to your specific size constraints.</p>
<p>The ‘Ken Burns’ tool, you can rely on this one to spark the slideshow images with the coolest zoom and pan effects. The tool is represented by ‘Red and Green’ boxes above the ‘Video Preview’ box in the editor timeline. You can easily move and resize the boxes using the ‘Hand’ and the ‘Cross Hair’ tools respectively. When you are satisfied with your work, hit ‘Done’ to return and confirm the changes, or click on the next presentation slide to crop and pan the same.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Clock Tool</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Clock’ icon lets you adjust the screen time of each slide, assigning a preset minimum duration of 0.25 seconds to each slide. Setting a play duration somewhere between 2-2.5 seconds would be an optimal choice. Avoid choosing shorter slide duration unless it becomes an obvious requirement, lest the audience may find it hard to process the contents.</p>
<p>Prefer adjusting the screen time separately for each slide, in case you have a large project with more than 50 slides. It is instead, advisable to time the entire project under one time frame, while setting a longer screen time for the title slide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add an Upbeat Background Audio</strong></p>
<p>Adding background music to your presentation slides is pretty simple, with you having to just position the audio files within the desired slides using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. The slides containing music pieces will have a ‘Light Green’ highlighting box under them. To correct a wrong placement, drag the audio file across the individual slides and drop at the correct space. You can further, modify the length of the audio clips by extending and trimming them.</p>
<p>To import audio files from your online iTunes account, navigate to and click within the ‘Music and Sound Effects’ box at the bottom right corner of the editor timeline. You can also clip the music file to start playing the background audio from a certain point within the track. To do this, take the cursor to the end of the track and drag the red indicator line to the point where you wish the audio to end at or begin playing from.</p>

                ></p>

When all looks good, navigate to the ‘Functions Toolbar’ at the top and hit the ‘Share’ tab to select a media sharing platform of your choice. You can even choose to export your slideshow directly from the editor timeline via QuickTime.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Video Adjustment Tool</strong></p>
<p>Using the ‘Video Adjustment’ option, you are granted the liberty to adjust the brightness, contrast, white point, exposure, saturation and levels of the added images. If your images have an appreciable quality by default, you can skip this step.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Crop Tool</strong></p>
<p>Consider working with the ‘Crop Tool’ to zoom or pan the system camera across a selected slide. Click on the ‘Fit’ option to set the image within a chosen frame size; however you need to be cautious lest using the tool may render an incorrectly cropped image. Select the ‘Crop’ option to adjust the image aspect ratio according to your specific size constraints.</p>
<p>The ‘Ken Burns’ tool, you can rely on this one to spark the slideshow images with the coolest zoom and pan effects. The tool is represented by ‘Red and Green’ boxes above the ‘Video Preview’ box in the editor timeline. You can easily move and resize the boxes using the ‘Hand’ and the ‘Cross Hair’ tools respectively. When you are satisfied with your work, hit ‘Done’ to return and confirm the changes, or click on the next presentation slide to crop and pan the same.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Clock Tool</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Clock’ icon lets you adjust the screen time of each slide, assigning a preset minimum duration of 0.25 seconds to each slide. Setting a play duration somewhere between 2-2.5 seconds would be an optimal choice. Avoid choosing shorter slide duration unless it becomes an obvious requirement, lest the audience may find it hard to process the contents.</p>
<p>Prefer adjusting the screen time separately for each slide, in case you have a large project with more than 50 slides. It is instead, advisable to time the entire project under one time frame, while setting a longer screen time for the title slide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add an Upbeat Background Audio</strong></p>
<p>Adding background music to your presentation slides is pretty simple, with you having to just position the audio files within the desired slides using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. The slides containing music pieces will have a ‘Light Green’ highlighting box under them. To correct a wrong placement, drag the audio file across the individual slides and drop at the correct space. You can further, modify the length of the audio clips by extending and trimming them.</p>
<p>To import audio files from your online iTunes account, navigate to and click within the ‘Music and Sound Effects’ box at the bottom right corner of the editor timeline. You can also clip the music file to start playing the background audio from a certain point within the track. To do this, take the cursor to the end of the track and drag the red indicator line to the point where you wish the audio to end at or begin playing from.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Share Your Presentation</strong></p>
<p>Run a mock slideshow in the ‘Preview’ box to ensure that every element of the presentation is at its specified place. When all looks good, navigate to the ‘Functions Toolbar’ at the top and hit the ‘Share’ tab to select a media sharing platform of your choice. You can even choose to export your slideshow directly from the editor timeline via QuickTime.</p>

While you can master the art with consistent effort and practice, there are some really cool tips and tricks to quickly edit and uplift iMovie presentations.</p>
<p>Let us have a look at a few of the most prominent ones in the following section before you move ahead to <strong>create slideshow in iMovie</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="01Cool-Ways-to-Quickly-Edit-Your-iMovie-Videos-3"><a href="#01Cool-Ways-to-Quickly-Edit-Your-iMovie-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="01Cool Ways to Quickly Edit Your iMovie Videos"></a>01Cool Ways to Quickly Edit Your iMovie Videos</h3><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Crop to Zoon in the Video</strong></p>
<p>When editing your videos in the iMovie software, you can zoom in a desired portion of the video frame. All you need to do is, select a clip, tap on the ‘Crop’ button at the top right corner over the ‘Preview’ box, choose the ‘Crop to Fill’ option and drag the effect to the specific clip area you wish to crop. Apply your changes by clicking inside the checkbox at the top right corner.</p>

                      alt="iMovie Slideshow Creation Tips- Video ‘Crop and Zoom’ Feature"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Split a Clip</strong></p>
<p>You can reduce the size of a sufficiently long video clip by choosing to break the same into several parts or trim it to ward off unwanted portions. To split your footage, take your cursor to the specific splitting point of the clip within the editor timeline, make a right click, and select the ‘Split Clip’ option from the dropdown menu that follows next.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Detach an Audio File</strong></p>
<p>Detaching audio from a clip allows you to experiment with different video play options. You can let the run the in the background as you proceed to split a clip for inserting a still image. To work with the effect, navigate to and right click on a desired clip within the editor timeline and tap on ‘Detach Audio’ in the upcoming list of options. The added music clip in ’Blue’ will detach to appear as an independent clip in ‘Green’ within the software timeline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Fade Audio In and Out</strong></p>
<p>To ensure a smooth audio transition between successive clips, try hands at fading the audio in and out by pointing the cursor at a detached green or an attached blue audio clip, followed by dragging the small round circles at the beginning or end of the footage. To introduce a gradual fade in or out effect, drag the round button to the center of the video clip.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Include Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Transitions allow a seamless presentation flow by ensuring a smooth movement between different slides appearing in continuity. Add a suitable transition element to the video footage of your slideshow by navigating to and hitting the ‘Transition’ tab in the ‘Functions Toolbar’. The default transition screen time is 1 second, but you can customize the same by double clicking on the effect post the latter’s addition within the editor timeline.</p>

<h2 id="How-much-a-wedding-videographer-costs"><a href="#How-much-a-wedding-videographer-costs" class="headerlink" title="How much a wedding videographer costs"></a>How much a wedding videographer costs</h2><p>Hiring a photographer for your wedding day is likely a given, but you might be wondering about the cost to hire a videographer and if it’s worth the extra expense.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the average cost of a wedding videographer will largely depend on where you live, how many hours of coverage you want the videographer to capture, and how experienced the professional is. The longer they</p>
<p>’ve been in the business, the more likely the cost will increase.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you start with a standard package and customised it from there to make sure all your bases are covered. You can often get a better bargain this way.</p>
<p>Peak wedding season may also affect the cost some vendors, making coverage from June through December a bit pricier and harder to secure. The range can often run between $1000 and $1,500</p>
<p>Nationwide or as much as $12,500 for a luxury shoot that turns you into a celebrity wedding coverage.</p>

<h3 id="What-include-in-the-packages"><a href="#What-include-in-the-packages" class="headerlink" title="What include in the packages"></a>What include in the packages</h3><p>Videographers, like wedding photographers, will have a variety of wedding packages for you to choose from.</p>
<p>Here’s what you can expect to see in a basic package</p>
<ul>
<li>Three-to-five-minute highlight video</li>
<li>A 20–30-minute full wedding video with wedding ceremony and speeches</li>
<li>Two cinematographers</li>
<li>An assistant to the videographer</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="There-are-also-extra-Some-videographer-offers-extras-such-as"><a href="#There-are-also-extra-Some-videographer-offers-extras-such-as" class="headerlink" title="There are also extra. Some videographer offers extras such as"></a>There are also extra. Some videographer offers extras such as</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Drone footage</strong>– Drones are popular, especially at destination weddings. They have the ability to film hundreds of feet in the air which also makes your wedding video more unique. The extra equipment needed for this can cost you anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000</li>
<li><strong>Travel</strong>– Just because you’re getting married in a far-off place doesn’t mean you can’t have your dream videographer. Just be prepared to pay for their travel. You will likely pay for their accommodations, meals, and travel</li>
<li><strong>Extra edits</strong>– Videographers spend hours editing your final wedding video, so if you request any additional edits, it’s likely going to cost you</li>
<li><strong>Filming before and after the wedding</strong>– Whether your wedding is a weekend long affair or you host a brunch for your friends and family the day of the wedding, filming these moments is going to be additional cost. Discuss plans with your videographer as soon as possible so they can check their availability and they can give you a total for a wedding budget</li>
<li><strong>Tipping</strong>– tips are always welcomed even if they’re not expected. Your videographer puts in a lot of time and effort into capturing the beauty of the day, so any gesture of your appreciation will be welcomed.</li>
</ul>
<p>And know what additional time can cost as much as $200-$500 per half hour, which pays for the videographer’s and assistant time, time spent editing additional footage, and video cards.</p>
<p>These included highlights and wedding videos will be professionally edited and they will also be set to music and delivered to you either via USB or through an online platform.</p>
<p>Typical videography prices also depend on the package you choose during the wedding planning process. Of course, you’re paying for a certain number of hours of coverage on your wedding day, but the post production editing process is even more time consuming and costly. While most videographers will produce an edited wedding movie, some may offer multiple clips at different lengths, like a wedding trailer for social media and a longer cinematic feature. Others might also be willing to give you the raw footage for your own personal use. Be sure to read your contract before making any final decisions so you know exactly what to get after the wedding day.</p>
<p>This one might sound strange. But the most experienced wedding videographer’s typically charge more than the going market rate. Price is a good way to tell who is the longest standing wedding videographer in an area. As the adage goes…you get what you pay for</p>
<h2 id="Tips-on-saving-money-on-wedding-videographer"><a href="#Tips-on-saving-money-on-wedding-videographer" class="headerlink" title="Tips on saving money on wedding videographer"></a>Tips on saving money on wedding videographer</h2><p>While you would need a professional videographer for your wedding and this does cost quite a penny, there are a few tips you could employ in saving on videography costs.</p>
<p><strong>Time</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned before, the more time the videographer spends at your event the more it would cost. Therefore, if you are looking to minimize the average cost of a wedding videographer, you could have him stay for only the most important aspects of the wedding. You could skip the pre-wedding prep part and also the last part of the reception. Because everyone now has mobile phone and can tag you what they captured on your social media. You can also use a hashtag where your friends can tag all of your wedding photo captured by them.</p>
<p><strong>No extras</strong></p>
<p>Such extras as cinematic effects, drone footage, personalised packaging and extra coppies of the finished product all add up in cost. Leaving extras out will go a long way uncutting costs.</p>
<p><strong>No editing</strong></p>
<p>Since post-production is the most time-consuming aspect, accepting the raw footage instead of an edited one would definitely cost less. You could choose to do the editing much later if desired.</p>
<p>You can also do your own editing, it’s also different from the feeling of editing your own wedding footage, because you can actually see the raw footage and personalised the editing.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Your wedding video will capture the magical moments of your wedding day and help keep those memories for years to come. While we can’t place a price on quality, it is still helpful to know the average cost of a wedding videographer. If its fits in your wedding budget, a videographer is a great addition to your line up of vendors because after all, re-watching your nuptials will be priceless.</p>
<p>Capture the moments you can’t remember, your wedding day is a blur of excitement, love, and happiness. But what about all those special moments that happen when you’re not looking? What about the speeches, the first dance, or your dad’s toast? You might be able to recall some of these memories if they were captured on video but chances are you’ll never know for sure.</p>

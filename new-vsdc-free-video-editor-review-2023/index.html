<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<li>Demos are unavailable. On the homepage, demo can be found and played, but while generating voiceovers, no demo will be found.</li>
<li>It has no merge feature: You can’t combine multiple audio files to make it one. Almost all major text-to-speech tools have a merge feature, but, Notevibes lags in this respect.</li>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<p>The key advantage of Apple’s QuickTime is that it comes pre-installed on your Mac’s macOS operating system. It’s powerful enough to rotate your clip, yet it’s simple enough for beginners to do. iTunes files can be played and edited with QuickTime. After rotation, it exports a new video file, leaving the old clip on the Mac. The output video will be compressed slightly, resulting in a smaller rotational video file than the original.</p>

<ul>
<li>Anything can be recorded, including video, audio, and the screen.</li>
<li>Cropping, audio detachment, combining, and rotation are all simple video editing techniques.</li>

<p>This app may already be installed on your smartphone, but you are unaware of its full potential. This program includes a built-in picture and video editor in addition to backing up your photos. This program includes three essential video editing tools that are extremely basic and easy to use.</p>
<p>The first is to stabilize the video; if your video is unsteady, you can use this option in Google Photos to stabilize it. You may also use the timeline below the video to cut the video. If you mistakenly captured the video in the wrong orientation, there is a tool to rotate it.</p>
<p>Features of Google Photos</p>

</li>
<li><p>Over time, Google has improved the Google Photos interface, and it now incorporates AI to provide consumers with even better performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There aren’t many effects, and there aren’t any other editing tools.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The lack of a password-protection option in Google Photos is annoying. Some photos are private, and you may not wish to share them with others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Users of Google Photos will no longer have limitless storage.</p>

<p>This app may already be installed on your smartphone, but you are unaware of its full potential. This program includes a built-in picture and video editor in addition to backing up your photos. This program includes three essential video editing tools that are extremely basic and easy to use.</p>
<p>The first is to stabilize the video; if your video is unsteady, you can use this option in Google Photos to stabilize it. You may also use the timeline below the video to cut the video. If you mistakenly captured the video in the wrong orientation, there is a tool to rotate it.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Over time, Google has improved the Google Photos interface, and it now incorporates AI to provide consumers with even better performance.</p>

<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There aren’t many effects, and there aren’t any other editing tools.</p>

<p><strong>Shooting the first clip</strong></p>
<p>For the first shot, stay on one side of the frame and do the first action. For example, you can pretend to yank and take off your jacket. Then, drop the jacket to the other side of the frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="shooting the first clip"
                ></p>
<p>To make it more realistic, make an interaction by reacting to the “clone” while facing the other direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make an interaction"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Shooting the second clip</strong></p>
<p>Then, shoot for the second clip without changing the frame. You will have to go to the place where you dropped the jacket from the first shot.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="shooting the second clip"
                ></p>
<p>Act as if you have just appeared there and give a reaction to the other side as well.</p>

<p>Once you have opened Filmora 11, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Step1 Bring the first clip to the timeline and cut the clip where you pretend to yank and take off the jacket. Select and delete the unnecessary clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-4.jpg"
                      alt="bring the first clip to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 After you have the first part of the effect ready, let’s start working on the clone part using masking.</p>
<p>First, place the second clip on a different window track, and the starting point is where you react to the “clone.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-5.jpg"
                      alt="place the second clip on a different window track"
                ></p>
<p>Then, double-click the second clip and go to the Filmora setting window. Tap on the <strong>Mask</strong> section &gt; <strong>Single line</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-6.jpg"
                      alt="tap on mask section"
                ></p>
<p>On the preview screen, adjust the position of the mask to only show “the clone.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-7.gif"
                      alt="adjust the position of the mask"
                ></p>
<p>Set the blur strength on the setting to make a smoother edge transition.</p>
<p>Step3 If the timing of the two clips doesn’t match, you can fix it using the speed ramping feature on Filmora 11. To use it, double-click the second clip and select <strong>Speed &gt; Speed Ramping &gt; Customize</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-8.jpg"
                      alt="double-click the second clip"
                ></p>
<p>Move the keyframe up to increase the speed. You can adjust it according to your needs.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-9.gif"
                      alt="adjust keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Once you are satisfied, adjust the clip length on the timeline and make sure that both clips finish at the same time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the clip length"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Extra tip:</strong> Add one more effect to make it more magical.</p>
<p>Step1 Open the <strong>Effects</strong> window and search for “up down 1.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="open the effects window"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Drag and drop the effect onto the timeline where the first cut is set. Adjust the effect length to match the action.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drag and drop the effect onto the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Then, drag and drop the effect again in the transition between the first and the second clip. Adjust it to the appropriate length, then it will give a more dramatic effect.</p>
<p>Step3 You can playback and see how it looks on the preview screen.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Using Windows’ Game Bar -</strong> Windows key + ALT + PrintScreen</li>
<li><strong>NVIDIA’s Shadow Play -</strong> ALT + Z</li>

It has attracted more than 12 million views. Admittedly, the title and the video concept are already enough to attract many viewers. But we can’t say that the thumbnail did not help. It’s actually really good.</p>
<p>The thumbnail shows a screenshot from Warzone. A player’s character is in the middle, with his back facing the camera. The words “AFK. Don’t shoot!” are written on the wall he is facing. The character is viewed through a sniper scope. It’s more “funny” than cool. But for what the video is about, it works fantastic.</p>

Again, the title likely is the main reason why it got that many views. But for sure, people did not read that long title at first. They were drawn to it by the thumbnail.</p>
<p>The thumbnail shows a clear-as-crystal screenshot of a team of 4 players on the battlefield. At the top left corner is the PS5 logo. Then, at the bottom left is an icon that says the video is in 4K UHD. If you’re also uploading 4K Warzone videos, you can try doing this. Users are attracted to videos that are eye-pleasing.</p>

At the top right is the victory banner, and at the bottom is the logo for kills with the number 64 next to it. The top right shows the logo of COD Warzone.</p>
<p>Players are attracted to amazing gameplay. Unsurprisingly, the player who got 64 kills got 3.1 million views in his video. The gist is that if you have achieved something amazing, try to incorporate it into the thumbnail.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Using in-game screenshots is recommended for making amazing COD Warzone thumbnails. But you should not use raw photos. You must edit them to ensure they have visual appeal. Of course, that means you need a good thumbnail maker.</p>
<p>Your best option is Wondershare Filmora. Why? Because it is a thumbnail maker and video editing software in one. Also, it allows you to make thumbnails for free! What could be better than that?</p>

That way, the image is personalized and can’t be found anywhere else. Unfortunately, COD: Warzone does not have an in-game functionality for screenshots. So, you have to get the image using other means. You can use the following keyboard shortcuts to grab a screenshot:</p>

<li><strong>Using Windows’ Game Bar -</strong> Windows key + ALT + PrintScreen</li>
<li><strong>NVIDIA’s Shadow Play -</strong> ALT + Z</li>

It has attracted more than 12 million views. Admittedly, the title and the video concept are already enough to attract many viewers. But we can’t say that the thumbnail did not help. It’s actually really good.</p>
<p>The thumbnail shows a screenshot from Warzone. A player’s character is in the middle, with his back facing the camera. The words “AFK. Don’t shoot!” are written on the wall he is facing. The character is viewed through a sniper scope. It’s more “funny” than cool. But for what the video is about, it works fantastic.</p>

<p>This video from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlxN49jn6Y" >HEDGEHOG ヅ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has a whopping 12 million views. Again, the title likely is the main reason why it got that many views. But for sure, people did not read that long title at first. They were drawn to it by the thumbnail.</p>
<p>The thumbnail shows a clear-as-crystal screenshot of a team of 4 players on the battlefield. At the top left corner is the PS5 logo. Then, at the bottom left is an icon that says the video is in 4K UHD. If you’re also uploading 4K Warzone videos, you can try doing this. Users are attracted to videos that are eye-pleasing.</p>

<p>The thumbnail for this video (made by <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9zMSBcius" >GTX 1050 Ti <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>), with 5.2 million views, is just an in-game screenshot. At the top-right is a large logo of GEFORCE RTX 3080 and at the bottom left is an Intel logo. Like the previous one, it attracts viewers by stating the visual appeal of the video.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Like most Warzone thumbnails, this thumbnail from a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5VNeLLs2yM" >Vikkstar123 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> video features a gun. At the top right is the victory banner, and at the bottom is the logo for kills with the number 64 next to it. The top right shows the logo of COD Warzone.</p>
<p>Players are attracted to amazing gameplay. Unsurprisingly, the player who got 64 kills got 3.1 million views in his video. The gist is that if you have achieved something amazing, try to incorporate it into the thumbnail.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Using in-game screenshots is recommended for making amazing COD Warzone thumbnails. But you should not use raw photos. You must edit them to ensure they have visual appeal. Of course, that means you need a good thumbnail maker.</p>
<p>Your best option is Wondershare Filmora. Why? Because it is a thumbnail maker and video editing software in one. Also, it allows you to make thumbnails for free! What could be better than that?</p>

These are very easy to understand, so go through the following steps for splitting the video clips. Two ways are trimming and splitting the clips in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><strong>First method: splitting on the timeline</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Selection of the clip in the timeline that you want to split. Your play head should be precisely at this particular place from where you need the splitting.</p>

                      alt="split a clip in lightworks "
                ></p>
<p>There is also a possibility of hiding the red icon of the scissor present. You can do it by tapping on the options of Wondershare Filmora. Then go to Preferencesàediting. Now uncheck the button of <strong>Split.</strong></p>
<p><img

<p><strong>Second method: detection of the scene</strong></p>

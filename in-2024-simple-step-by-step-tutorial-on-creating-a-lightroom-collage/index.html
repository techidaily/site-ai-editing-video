It helps by refreshing all the memories of a trip, function, and more in a single frame.</p>
<p>They have gained huge popularity in the last few years as the digital space has grown. You may have already seen social media users posting their photo collages on their timelines. Instagram is far ahead of the competition in this regard. It has played a crucial role in establishing the photo collage as a normal trend.</p>
<p><strong>For the photographer</strong></p>
<p>With a photo collage, a photographer can best showcase his talent. It shows that you can do a lot more than your capabilities, like representing stories by blending colors and elements perfectly. This will help you attract your prospects and convert them into your paying customers.</p>
<p><strong>How do photo collages provide value to the clients?</strong></p>
<p>A photo collage provides visual value to the clients by enhancing the creative process. It can have a profound effect on the way they perceive your art of photography. In fact, your clients will love to see all their memories collected in an attractive photo collage. There are a lot of people that even love to present collages to their loved ones.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage"><a href="#Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage"></a>Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage</h2><p>The secret to designing an eye-catching <strong>lightroom collage</strong> is to know how to blend all the elements together properly. Professional Lightroom users concentrate on a few key graphic design considerations to keep their photo collage looking its best.In other words, every element should be in the right proportion, such as dimension, alignment, proximity, and theme.</p>
<p><strong>Balance</strong></p>
<p>Balance refers to the arrangement of all elements. It includes the division of pictures into equal or different dimensions according to the collage size. Maintaining balance enhances the overall appearance of a photo collage in lightroom. Some lightroom experts prefer symmetrical balance, but you can get better quality collages through asymmetrical balance.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong></p>
<p>Don’t underestimate the importance of alignment in <strong>Lightroom collage</strong>. How your pictures are aligned can have a drastic effect on their overall look. It provides a definitive structure and delivers a well-finished product to the client.</p>
<p>In graphic design, two kinds of elements exist: edge and centre alignment. These are applied to visual design and text as well.</p>
<p><strong>Proximity</strong></p>
<p>Proximity signifies the relationship between various elements on the basis of the distance between them. It follows two basic principles:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Realistic pictures should be put together.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unrelatable images should be separated.</p>
<p>Moreover, the border width needs to be consistent throughout, irrespective of the number of pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
<p>The theme, also known as tone or style, matters when it comes to collage design. Each image must have a similar style, as this idea can personify all the captured memories. It will completely beautify your artistic perspective, but it’s not as measurable as others.</p>

<p>Now, you can narrate your story with incredible text and title templates in this full-featured video editor. It now features an animated split-screen effect that converts multiple videos into a single compelling collage. You only have to import the clips that you want in the split-screen preview window to make the video collage. But, for photo collages, the best tool ever is Adobe Lightroom.</p>
<p>You get two options for creating photo collages in Lightroom: using a pre-designed template or creating a new one. It will be a time-consuming process to make an original template, but we will still focus on both. If you want to create a <strong>lightroom collage</strong> of pictures, follow the steps given below.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a New Template</strong></p>
<p>For a beginner, designing their own template can be a complex and hectic process. But, it’s worth it in the end because the final collage will be the result of all your hard work. In addition, you can show your own creative style by designing a new layout template. This way, you can also deliver a unique creation to your client. Maybe they will end up paying you more as a reward. If you are up for it, then go read the steps to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import and Edit Photographs</strong></p>
<p>Your first step should be to import the photos into your lightroom before proceeding further. Next, to get a perfect collage, your pictures deserve a final touch, which you can do conveniently with the batch editing feature.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/easy-step-by-step-tutorial-on-creating-a-lightroom-collage-1.jpg"
                      alt="print module"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Establishing the Workspace</strong></p>
<p>After importing and editing the photos, it’s time to create a workspace. Go to the “Print” panel and then to the “Print Job” menu. At this point, you can adjust the dimension of your collage. Make sure to provide ample space for the photos and borders.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Create a Photo Layout</strong></p>
<p>As you have photos in hand and space for distributing them, start forming individual spaces to place them. Try using individual boxes as per the required size or your choice with the “Add to Package” section. You can find it under the Cell of Print menu. Feel free to experiment with the size, placement, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Photos to the Layout</strong></p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the collage template, now bring all your photos to the layout. It’s pretty easy to do because you just have to click on the photo and drag it to where you want. At the end, rearrange as you want until the final design doesn’t seem pleasing to your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a Pre-designed Template</strong></p>
<p>Want to save some time without compromising on the final quality of the collage? <strong>Make a collage in Lightroom</strong> using a pre-designed template. But remember, you won’t get enough freedom to customize the template. If you are up for creating a collage in Lightroom using a pre-designed template, go through the following points.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import the photos into the program</strong></p>
<p>Here also, you can’t create the collage without adding your photos to Lightroom. Simply click on “File” &gt; “Add Photos” and choose the file location.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Download the collage layout</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Lightroom offers free as well as paid templates to make a <strong>photo collage in Lightroom.</strong> You are free to download any one that appeals to you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Bring in the Template</strong></p>
<p>Click on the “Print” module &gt; “Template Browser” &gt; “Lightroom Templates” menu. Now, import the extracted <strong>Lightroom collage template</strong> using the “Import” button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="template browser"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Insert Photos</strong></p>
<p>After finishing up the import of the template, start adding the photos to them. You can reposition them in whatever way you want. And now, you are done. Export the collage if you are satisfied with the position, color, and everything else.</p>

The real struggle is in creating the collage. That takes a bit more time, but it’s worth it in the end.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>You can follow any of the above steps to get your desired photo collage. So now, you can reduce your burden with Adobe Lightroom or Wondershare Filmora .</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage-2"><a href="#Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage"></a>Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage</h2><p>The secret to designing an eye-catching <strong>lightroom collage</strong> is to know how to blend all the elements together properly. Professional Lightroom users concentrate on a few key graphic design considerations to keep their photo collage looking its best.In other words, every element should be in the right proportion, such as dimension, alignment, proximity, and theme.</p>
<p><strong>Balance</strong></p>
<p>Balance refers to the arrangement of all elements. It includes the division of pictures into equal or different dimensions according to the collage size. Maintaining balance enhances the overall appearance of a photo collage in lightroom. Some lightroom experts prefer symmetrical balance, but you can get better quality collages through asymmetrical balance.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong></p>
<p>Don’t underestimate the importance of alignment in <strong>Lightroom collage</strong>. How your pictures are aligned can have a drastic effect on their overall look. It provides a definitive structure and delivers a well-finished product to the client.</p>
<p>In graphic design, two kinds of elements exist: edge and centre alignment. These are applied to visual design and text as well.</p>
<p><strong>Proximity</strong></p>
<p>Proximity signifies the relationship between various elements on the basis of the distance between them. It follows two basic principles:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Realistic pictures should be put together.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unrelatable images should be separated.</p>
<p>Moreover, the border width needs to be consistent throughout, irrespective of the number of pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
<p>The theme, also known as tone or style, matters when it comes to collage design. Each image must have a similar style, as this idea can personify all the captured memories. It will completely beautify your artistic perspective, but it’s not as measurable as others.</p>

It now features an animated split-screen effect that converts multiple videos into a single compelling collage. You only have to import the clips that you want in the split-screen preview window to make the video collage. But, for photo collages, the best tool ever is Adobe Lightroom.</p>
<p>You get two options for creating photo collages in Lightroom: using a pre-designed template or creating a new one. It will be a time-consuming process to make an original template, but we will still focus on both. If you want to create a <strong>lightroom collage</strong> of pictures, follow the steps given below.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a New Template</strong></p>
<p>For a beginner, designing their own template can be a complex and hectic process. But, it’s worth it in the end because the final collage will be the result of all your hard work. In addition, you can show your own creative style by designing a new layout template. This way, you can also deliver a unique creation to your client. Maybe they will end up paying you more as a reward. If you are up for it, then go read the steps to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import and Edit Photographs</strong></p>
<p>Your first step should be to import the photos into your lightroom before proceeding further. Next, to get a perfect collage, your pictures deserve a final touch, which you can do conveniently with the batch editing feature.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="print module"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Establishing the Workspace</strong></p>
<p>After importing and editing the photos, it’s time to create a workspace. Go to the “Print” panel and then to the “Print Job” menu. At this point, you can adjust the dimension of your collage. Make sure to provide ample space for the photos and borders.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Create a Photo Layout</strong></p>
<p>As you have photos in hand and space for distributing them, start forming individual spaces to place them. Try using individual boxes as per the required size or your choice with the “Add to Package” section. You can find it under the Cell of Print menu. Feel free to experiment with the size, placement, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Photos to the Layout</strong></p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the collage template, now bring all your photos to the layout. It’s pretty easy to do because you just have to click on the photo and drag it to where you want. At the end, rearrange as you want until the final design doesn’t seem pleasing to your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a Pre-designed Template</strong></p>
<p>Want to save some time without compromising on the final quality of the collage? <strong>Make a collage in Lightroom</strong> using a pre-designed template. But remember, you won’t get enough freedom to customize the template. If you are up for creating a collage in Lightroom using a pre-designed template, go through the following points.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import the photos into the program</strong></p>
<p>Here also, you can’t create the collage without adding your photos to Lightroom. Simply click on “File” &gt; “Add Photos” and choose the file location.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Download the collage layout</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Lightroom offers free as well as paid templates to make a <strong>photo collage in Lightroom.</strong> You are free to download any one that appeals to you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Bring in the Template</strong></p>
<p>Click on the “Print” module &gt; “Template Browser” &gt; “Lightroom Templates” menu. Now, import the extracted <strong>Lightroom collage template</strong> using the “Import” button.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="template browser"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Insert Photos</strong></p>
<p>After finishing up the import of the template, start adding the photos to them. You can reposition them in whatever way you want. And now, you are done. Export the collage if you are satisfied with the position, color, and everything else.</p>

<ul>
<li>First, install the Wondershare Filmora.</li>
<li>Then, launch this application on your PC or Mac</li>

<h5 id="Step2-Import-your-Photos-and-Videos"><a href="#Step2-Import-your-Photos-and-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Import your Photos and Videos"></a>Step2 Import your Photos and Videos</h5><p>Importing your videos and pictures to Filmora’s media panel is best to have them all in one folder. Therefore, when you open Wondershare Filmora, you will notice the main import window in the top left corner.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click in the center of the <strong>import</strong> window upon the import icon.</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> from the PC library to where your target Videos and Photos are stored.</li>
<li>Please select the required videos and photos and <strong>Open</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-2.png"
                      alt="import your videos and photos"
                ></p>
<p>Your next step will be to add the imported videos and images to the timeline.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-your-Photos-and-Videos-to-the-Timeline"><a href="#Step3-Add-your-Photos-and-Videos-to-the-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline"></a>Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline</h5><p>When you have multiple videos and photos, you can add all of them simultaneously. Or you can also add them one by one wherever you need. Follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the photo or video you want.</li>
<li>Keep holding the Right-click and drag it down to the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-3.png"
                      alt="add your photos and videos to your timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have imported your photos and videos into the timeline, it is time to align and add text.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-Title"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-Title" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the Title"></a>Step4 Add the Title</h5><p>To create an attractive slideshow, you will need to add a title before the start of the video. Doing so will allow you to gain more viewers and audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Add a Black Screen</strong></p>
<p>The black screen will eventually act like a canvas to give your title a good look. To add a black screen, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>media</strong> icon from the bar above the import window.</li>
<li>You will notice many tabs on the left-hand side under a drop-down bar.</li>
<li>Scroll below to find the <strong>sample media</strong></li>
<li>Download the black color if it is not downloaded already.</li>
<li>Click and drag it down below to the start of your video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-4.png"
                      alt="adding a black screen"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Title Tile</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have our canvas, we will now add the title. Above the import media library, there will be a <strong>Title</strong> icon.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>title</strong> icon, and select the title that you want for your video by browsing and scrolling down.</li>
<li>For this purpose, we will use a simple title tile called “<strong>Title 29</strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can find the same title by scrolling, browsing, or searching in the search bar above the import library.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click and drag the title onto the black screen that we added.</li>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> the title to open its settings.</li>
<li>Here you can type in the text that you want.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-5.png"
                      alt="add a title"
                ></p>
<p>You can also change its font. When you click on the font bar, a drop-down option will pop up, and you choose whichever you like.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the <strong>animation</strong> of the text title from the top left corner <strong>animation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Change The Timing of The Title</strong></p>
<p>You can also adjust the timing of the title by below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>advanced option</strong> in the bottom right corner, and settings will pop up.</li>
<li>Find the title bar and drag it to the right side to increase the timing of the title.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-6.png"
                      alt="change the timing of the title"
                ></p>
<p>After adding the title, it’s time to go with fading effect as shown below!</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Add-a-Fade-effect"><a href="#Step5-Add-a-Fade-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Add a Fade effect"></a>Step5 Add a Fade effect</h5><p>You can also add a fade transition to the start of your video. It will blend the title with the first clip. Follow the steps mentioned to add the transition effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search the <strong>Fade</strong> option from the Transitions tab above the import window</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A fade transition will allow your title to fade into the first clip creating a visually pleasing effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the <strong>Fade</strong> transition and <strong>drag</strong> it between the Black screen and the first clip.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-7.png"
                      alt="adding a fade effect"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have added a transition, it is time to move on to our music!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Add-The-Music"><a href="#Step6-Add-The-Music" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Add The Music"></a>Step6 Add The Music</h5><p>You can add your music to the slideshow from your PC library, but make sure you have the music rights. It is better to use stock audio by following the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Audio</strong> icon on the bar above the import window, and the list will pop up.</li>
<li>Please browse the library to find music that best suits your video and download it.</li>
<li>Then add it to the timeline’s audio track.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Beat Detection</strong></p>
<p>To match your video clips properly with the music, so it remains in sync, you can adjust it with the beat of the music. To add beat detection, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-Click on the audio that you selected in the audio library.</li>
<li>You will see a pop-up list, and in the options, you will see Beat detection.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Beat detection</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-8.png"
                      alt="adding beat detection"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Then click on the audio and drag it below on the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Match The Video With The Audio Markers</strong></p>
<p>To have the full advantage of beat detection, you must adjust your videos and photos to the markers. Follow the steps mentioned below to do so:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-9.png"
                      alt="matching the video with the audio"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the video clips are in sync with the marker on the audio.</li>
<li>For this, drag one video end to a marker or as many videos as you want.</li>
<li>Ultimately, you will create a timeline in which your videos sync with the audio beat.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-10.png"
                      alt="synced video with audio"
                ></p>
<p>After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.</p>
<h5 id="Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background"><a href="#Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Scale and Blur The Background"></a>Step7 Scale and Blur The Background</h5><p>Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.</p>
<p>If you leave the picture&#x2F;photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-11.png"
                      alt="unscaled photo in the main play window"
                ></p>
<p>To counter this problem, follow some easy steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the picture with black borders, and it will open the settings list.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Transform</strong> Here you can see multiple settings.</li>
<li>Increase the size of your photo to match the aspect ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-12.png"
                      alt="scaling of the photo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Background Blur Effect</strong></p>
<p>In some cases where you have taken a portrait photo where the picture is vertical, it ultimately stays out of proportion to the aspect ratio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Simply scaling the image to match the aspect ratio size is not sensible in this case. Doing so will hide the many pretty features of a portrait.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-13.png"
                      alt="photo with black borders"
                ></p>
<p>To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong> tab above the import window and search for <strong>Blur</strong>.</li>
<li>Download the blur effect that suits you best and then <strong>drag</strong> the blur effect above your photo in the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice the background turn to a blur in the main play screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-14.png"
                      alt="photo with blurred background"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step8-Add-a-Transition"><a href="#Step8-Add-a-Transition" class="headerlink" title="Step8 Add a Transition"></a>Step8 Add a Transition</h5><p>You can also add a transition effect to spice up things. It can get bland when your video or photo changes from one to another. To create a good slideshow video, you can add a transition effect by following the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Transition</strong> icon above the import window.</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> the library until you find a transition you like, then download one.</li>
<li>Click on the transition and drag it between the clips.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="transition effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Adjust The Duration and Placement of The Transition</strong></p>
<p>Now it’s time to adjust the duration and placement of the transition. For this, you can follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the transition effect, and it will open the settings list.</li>
<li>You can adjust the duration by setting the timer as per your requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If other transitions are added to the timeline, you can adjust them by clicking Apply to all.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adjusting the duration of the transition"
                ></p>
<p>When you have adjusted the slideshow transitions, it is time to move on to the effects and filters.</p>
<h5 id="Step9-Add-the-Effects-and-Filters"><a href="#Step9-Add-the-Effects-and-Filters" class="headerlink" title="Step9 Add the Effects and Filters"></a>Step9 Add the Effects and Filters</h5><p>If you create a slideshow video of your trip to a historical place.

<h5 id="Step2-Import-your-Photos-and-Videos-1"><a href="#Step2-Import-your-Photos-and-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Import your Photos and Videos"></a>Step2 Import your Photos and Videos</h5><p>Importing your videos and pictures to Filmora’s media panel is best to have them all in one folder. Therefore, when you open Wondershare Filmora, you will notice the main import window in the top left corner.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click in the center of the <strong>import</strong> window upon the import icon.</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> from the PC library to where your target Videos and Photos are stored.</li>
<li>Please select the required videos and photos and <strong>Open</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-2.png"
                      alt="import your videos and photos"
                ></p>
<p>Your next step will be to add the imported videos and images to the timeline.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-your-Photos-and-Videos-to-the-Timeline-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-your-Photos-and-Videos-to-the-Timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline"></a>Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline</h5><p>When you have multiple videos and photos, you can add all of them simultaneously. Or you can also add them one by one wherever you need. Follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the photo or video you want.</li>
<li>Keep holding the Right-click and drag it down to the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-3.png"
                      alt="add your photos and videos to your timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have imported your photos and videos into the timeline, it is time to align and add text.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-Title-1"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-Title-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the Title"></a>Step4 Add the Title</h5><p>To create an attractive slideshow, you will need to add a title before the start of the video. Doing so will allow you to gain more viewers and audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Add a Black Screen</strong></p>
<p>The black screen will eventually act like a canvas to give your title a good look. To add a black screen, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>media</strong> icon from the bar above the import window.</li>
<li>You will notice many tabs on the left-hand side under a drop-down bar.</li>
<li>Scroll below to find the <strong>sample media</strong></li>
<li>Download the black color if it is not downloaded already.</li>
<li>Click and drag it down below to the start of your video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-4.png"
                      alt="adding a black screen"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Title Tile</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have our canvas, we will now add the title. Above the import media library, there will be a <strong>Title</strong> icon.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>title</strong> icon, and select the title that you want for your video by browsing and scrolling down.</li>
<li>For this purpose, we will use a simple title tile called “<strong>Title 29</strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can find the same title by scrolling, browsing, or searching in the search bar above the import library.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click and drag the title onto the black screen that we added.</li>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> the title to open its settings.</li>
<li>Here you can type in the text that you want.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-5.png"
                      alt="add a title"
                ></p>
<p>You can also change its font. When you click on the font bar, a drop-down option will pop up, and you choose whichever you like.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the <strong>animation</strong> of the text title from the top left corner <strong>animation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Change The Timing of The Title</strong></p>
<p>You can also adjust the timing of the title by below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>advanced option</strong> in the bottom right corner, and settings will pop up.</li>
<li>Find the title bar and drag it to the right side to increase the timing of the title.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-6.png"
                      alt="change the timing of the title"
                ></p>
<p>After adding the title, it’s time to go with fading effect as shown below!</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Add-a-Fade-effect-1"><a href="#Step5-Add-a-Fade-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Add a Fade effect"></a>Step5 Add a Fade effect</h5><p>You can also add a fade transition to the start of your video. It will blend the title with the first clip. Follow the steps mentioned to add the transition effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search the <strong>Fade</strong> option from the Transitions tab above the import window</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A fade transition will allow your title to fade into the first clip creating a visually pleasing effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the <strong>Fade</strong> transition and <strong>drag</strong> it between the Black screen and the first clip.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-7.png"
                      alt="adding a fade effect"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have added a transition, it is time to move on to our music!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Add-The-Music-1"><a href="#Step6-Add-The-Music-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Add The Music"></a>Step6 Add The Music</h5><p>You can add your music to the slideshow from your PC library, but make sure you have the music rights. It is better to use stock audio by following the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Audio</strong> icon on the bar above the import window, and the list will pop up.</li>
<li>Please browse the library to find music that best suits your video and download it.</li>
<li>Then add it to the timeline’s audio track.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Beat Detection</strong></p>
<p>To match your video clips properly with the music, so it remains in sync, you can adjust it with the beat of the music. To add beat detection, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-Click on the audio that you selected in the audio library.</li>
<li>You will see a pop-up list, and in the options, you will see Beat detection.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Beat detection</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-8.png"
                      alt="adding beat detection"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Then click on the audio and drag it below on the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Match The Video With The Audio Markers</strong></p>
<p>To have the full advantage of beat detection, you must adjust your videos and photos to the markers. Follow the steps mentioned below to do so:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-9.png"
                      alt="matching the video with the audio"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the video clips are in sync with the marker on the audio.</li>
<li>For this, drag one video end to a marker or as many videos as you want.</li>
<li>Ultimately, you will create a timeline in which your videos sync with the audio beat.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-10.png"
                      alt="synced video with audio"
                ></p>
<p>After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.</p>
<h5 id="Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background-1"><a href="#Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background-1" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Scale and Blur The Background"></a>Step7 Scale and Blur The Background</h5><p>Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.</p>
<p>If you leave the picture&#x2F;photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-11.png"
                      alt="unscaled photo in the main play window"
                ></p>
<p>To counter this problem, follow some easy steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the picture with black borders, and it will open the settings list.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Transform</strong> Here you can see multiple settings.</li>
<li>Increase the size of your photo to match the aspect ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-12.png"
                      alt="scaling of the photo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Background Blur Effect</strong></p>
<p>In some cases where you have taken a portrait photo where the picture is vertical, it ultimately stays out of proportion to the aspect ratio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Simply scaling the image to match the aspect ratio size is not sensible in this case. Doing so will hide the many pretty features of a portrait.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-13.png"
                      alt="photo with black borders"
                ></p>
<p>To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong> tab above the import window and search for <strong>Blur</strong>.</li>
<li>Download the blur effect that suits you best and then <strong>drag</strong> the blur effect above your photo in the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice the background turn to a blur in the main play screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photo with blurred background"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step8-Add-a-Transition-1"><a href="#Step8-Add-a-Transition-1" class="headerlink" title="Step8 Add a Transition"></a>Step8 Add a Transition</h5><p>You can also add a transition effect to spice up things. It can get bland when your video or photo changes from one to another. To create a good slideshow video, you can add a transition effect by following the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Transition</strong> icon above the import window.</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> the library until you find a transition you like, then download one.</li>
<li>Click on the transition and drag it between the clips.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="transition effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Adjust The Duration and Placement of The Transition</strong></p>
<p>Now it’s time to adjust the duration and placement of the transition. For this, you can follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the transition effect, and it will open the settings list.</li>
<li>You can adjust the duration by setting the timer as per your requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If other transitions are added to the timeline, you can adjust them by clicking Apply to all.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adjusting the duration of the transition"
                ></p>
<p>When you have adjusted the slideshow transitions, it is time to move on to the effects and filters.</p>
<h5 id="Step9-Add-the-Effects-and-Filters-1"><a href="#Step9-Add-the-Effects-and-Filters-1" class="headerlink" title="Step9 Add the Effects and Filters"></a>Step9 Add the Effects and Filters</h5><p>If you create a slideshow video of your trip to a historical place.

<h2 id="Adjust-the-aspect-ratio"><a href="#Adjust-the-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="Adjust the aspect ratio"></a>Adjust the aspect ratio</h2><p>The aspect ratio is known as the size of the video frame. For example, the most common aspect ratios are 16:9 and 4:3. The first number represents the width, and the second represents the height.</p>
<p>You should always ask your cinematographer about the aspect ratio. There are chances when cameras won’t shoot at the intended aspect ratio they were framed for. In that case, you’ll need to crop or letterbox them when editing.</p>

If you have a measurement of one side of the frame, you can find the other by using some math. Let’s suppose your frame is 3424 pixels wide. You can use this formula to find the height.</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> 3424 pixels wide <strong>x</strong> 1 high &#x2F; 2.35 wide (or whatever your aspect ratio)</p>

You decided on the pace and flow of the video to create a basic structure. You made changes to make it interesting and captivating.</p>
<p>Before you put too much effort into editing your video, send it to your director, producer, or client for review. It will help ensure that any big changes can be made before you invest too much time in the edit.</p>
<p>For first drafts, you don’t need anything fancy. A lower-resolution and more compressed file can make sending it to a director or client much easier. You can also add a timer on the music video, so the person reviewing it can give you accurate timing on where he wants any revision.</p>

<li>Click on <strong>Effects</strong> and search for <strong>Timecode</strong> in the search bar.</li>
<li>Choose the timer style you like and drop it onto the new timeline.</li>
<li>Extend the timer to the end of the video.</li>
<li>Adjust the position and add the duration of your music video.</li>

<p>Now you are all set to export the first draft of your music video. You can also adjust the video format on the export option, but MP4 is recommended.</p>

By adjusting the aspect ratio to fit the desired screen size and properly planning the first cut, you can lay a solid foundation for the rest of the editing process.</p>
<p>These two steps can greatly impact the overall look and feel of the final product. Remember to communicate with your director, producer, or client throughout the process to ensure that the final product meets their expectations.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Examples-of-Augmented-Reality-AR-In-Marketing"><a href="#Part-3-Examples-of-Augmented-Reality-AR-In-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Examples of Augmented Reality (AR) In Marketing"></a>Part 3 <strong>Examples of Augmented Reality (AR) In Marketing</strong></h2><p>Having discussed enough about the fundamental aspects of augmented reality, let us proceed towards understanding the credibility of <strong>augmented video</strong> in the light of modern day information centered applications. While there are manifold varieties of augmented reality usage, the following section highlights the best examples of integrating AR into brand marketing:</p>
<h3 id="01Walmart-Inventory-Control"><a href="#01Walmart-Inventory-Control" class="headerlink" title="01Walmart- Inventory Control"></a>01Walmart- Inventory Control</h3><p>With the aim to examine the dual credibility of its brand stores as online fulfillment as well as physical shopping centers, Walmart in October 2020, announced the proposition of its 4 shopping units as ‘test centers’ of augmented reality, where the latter was supposed to aid in the management and tracking of company inventories.</p>
<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

While there are manifold varieties of augmented reality usage, the following section highlights the best examples of integrating AR into brand marketing:</p>
<h3 id="01Walmart-Inventory-Control-3"><a href="#01Walmart-Inventory-Control-3" class="headerlink" title="01Walmart- Inventory Control"></a>01Walmart- Inventory Control</h3><p>With the aim to examine the dual credibility of its brand stores as online fulfillment as well as physical shopping centers, Walmart in October 2020, announced the proposition of its 4 shopping units as ‘test centers’ of augmented reality, where the latter was supposed to aid in the management and tracking of company inventories.</p>
<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>

Based in London, the Machine-A virtual store was conceptualized to allow the access of relevant audience to the works of new talent in the fashion field, when the Covid-19 pandemic caused a shutdown of the London Fashion Week.</p>
<p>The store was launched as a virtual boutique that could be visited by interested audience through a QR code, which could be scanned from billboards and posters around the London city, and allowed them to view the latest works of the associated fashion designers through an <strong>augmented reality concept video</strong>. The major success of the utility lies in the enhancement of the consumer-brand relationship, while focusing primarily on product awareness and customer engagement.</p>

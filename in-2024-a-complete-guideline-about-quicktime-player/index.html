Two basic techniques can be implemented to play videos with QuickTime. The first method to play videos with QuickTime are featured as follows:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open QuickTime Player across your Mac. For that, proceed across Launchpad to access the application.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-1.jpg"
                      alt="select quicktime player"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Once the player is launched, you can simply select any video across the window that opens up. Once selected, tap “Open” to play it across QuickTime.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-2.jpg"
                      alt="tap on open button"
                ></p>
<p>Sounds easy, right? However, if you have multiple videos to open or have other video players installed in your Mac, you should consider following this second approach. If QuickTime Player is not your default video player, it is important to follow the steps below for opening any video across QuickTime.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open Finder on your device and proceed to locate the video that you wish to open across QuickTime. On finding the video, click on the video while holding the “Control” button on the keyboard. This opens a drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-3.jpg"
                      alt="choose your video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: In the “Open With” section across the menu, you will find the option of QuickTime Player. Tap on the option to open the video across QuickTime.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Although there are several QuickTime format files that you may come across and play across the platform, it only converts any video file into MOV format, which is the dedicated file format potentially designed by Apple. To understand the method to convert any QuickTime video format to MOV format, follow the steps shown below:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open the appropriate video across QuickTime to convert it accordingly. Once opened, tap on the “File” tab, and select “Export as” across the available options.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="access export as option"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: You need to select an appropriate resolution from the available options according to the video quality that you want the video to be saved in on the preceding menu. QuickTime player will show low-quality resolutions for the high-quality video but not vice versa.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 3: A new window opens that requires you to set up the name and location for the video. Add the file extension “.mov” at the end of the name of the video to convert it into MOV format.</p>

Although there are several QuickTime format files that you may come across and play across the platform, it only converts any video file into MOV format, which is the dedicated file format potentially designed by Apple. To understand the method to convert any QuickTime video format to MOV format, follow the steps shown below:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open the appropriate video across QuickTime to convert it accordingly. Once opened, tap on the “File” tab, and select “Export as” across the available options.</p>

<p>Step 2: You need to select an appropriate resolution from the available options according to the video quality that you want the video to be saved in on the preceding menu. QuickTime player will show low-quality resolutions for the high-quality video but not vice versa.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Object-Tracking"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Object Tracking?"></a>Part 1. What Is Object Tracking?</h2><p>Object Tracking determines the location of an object in a video and can be used for a variety of purposes, including surveillance, security, traffic control, digital forensics, anomaly detection, gesture recognition, visual surveillance, human-computer interaction, augmented reality, and robot vision.</p>
<p>Even though it may seem easy for an average person, object tracking is quite complex for computers because they have to analyze a set of frames and estimate the object’s trajectory based on numbers instead of images.</p>
<p>Because of how complicated it is, Object Tracking is considered one of the most difficult tasks in computer vision. Even though it’s a challenge, it’s not impossible to accomplish.</p>
<p>And there are two levels of Object Tracking that you should learn about:</p>
<h3 id="1-SOT-MOT"><a href="#1-SOT-MOT" class="headerlink" title="1. SOT &amp; MOT"></a>1. SOT &amp; MOT</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Single Object Tracking (SOT):</strong> SOT is a tracking algorithm that creates advanced appearance models and&#x2F;or motion models to manage difficult issues like out-of-plane rotations, illumination variations, or scale changes.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Object Tracking (MOT):</strong> MOT tracks every part of a video and is mainly concerned with mid-level tasks and serves as a foundation for high-level tasks.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-The-Difference-Between-Tracking-And-Detection"><a href="#2-The-Difference-Between-Tracking-And-Detection" class="headerlink" title="2. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection"></a>2. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection</h3><p>After knowing what Object Tracking is, there is another concept you should also be aware of - Object Detection.</p>
<p>The Object Tracking and Object Detection are two important methods in computer vision. Object Tracking tracks the position of a given object in an image in real-time, while Object Detection identifies and localizes objects in an image or video. That is the difference.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Object-Tracking"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Object Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Object Tracking</h2><h3 id="Image-Tracking"><a href="#Image-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Image Tracking"></a>Image Tracking</h3><p>Image tracking allows users to interact with digital content more naturally and helps users move and interact with digital objects in the same manner as they will with real-world physical objects.</p>
<p>Image tracking can be used in various augmented reality (AR) applications, such as AR gaming, shopping, and navigation. Moreover, you can also use it for educational purposes, such as teaching anatomy or providing instructions for a difficult task.</p>
<h3 id="Video-Tracking"><a href="#Video-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Video Tracking"></a>Video Tracking</h3><p>Video tracking is the process of tracking objects in a video sequence and can be used for various applications, such as detecting and counting objects in a scene, understanding their motions, and recognizing activities.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-The-Difficulties-Of-Object-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-The-Difficulties-Of-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?"></a>Part 3. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?</h2><p>As what has been mentioned above, the use of object tracking is versatile. However, there are some challenges associated with Object Tracking, such as:</p>
<p><strong>Background Clutter:</strong> The background can impact extracting an object’s features. If the background is more densely populated, detecting or tracking the object of interest can be more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Occlusion:</strong> This is a phenomenon where the object being tracked is affected by the background or foreground. This causes the tracking algorithm to get confused due to multiple objects coming close together, hence, losing track of the object.</p>
<p><strong>Varying spatial scales:</strong> Varying spatial scales refer to the target object being of a different size or shape, which can confuse the algorithm, leading to errors.</p>
<p><strong>Training and Tracking Speed:</strong> If the object is moving too fast or is too small, it can be difficult to track. Therefore, the tracking module has to be designed to track, identify, and localize objects in a matter of seconds.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process"><a href="#Part-4-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process"></a>Part 4. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process</h2><p>After the introduction of object tracking technically, let’s learn about its mechanism of it from two sides: periods of the working process and the way it tracks.</p>
<h3 id="1-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process"><a href="#1-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process" class="headerlink" title="1. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process"></a>1. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process</h3><p>Following are the stages of the Object Tracking process:</p>
<p><strong>Target Initialization</strong></p>
<p>Target initialization is the first step in Object Tracking and involves defining the targets or objects of interest and drawing a bounding box around them in the initial frame. After that, the tracker has to detect the position of the object in the frame while drawing the bounding box.</p>
<p><strong>Appearance Modeling</strong></p>
<p>Appearance modeling is important for understanding how an object will look under different circumstances. If the object being tracked changes appearance due to different lighting, angle, or speed, the tracking algorithm may lose its information and the object itself. Therefore, it has to be conducted to let the algorithm detect the changes and distortion.</p>
<p><strong>Motion Estimation</strong></p>
<p>Motion estimation entails the capacity of the model to anticipate an object’s future position with precision.</p>
<p><strong>Target Positioning</strong></p>
<p>Motion estimation is a process of approximating the most likely region where an object could be present. After the object’s location is approximated, a visual model can be used to determine the target’s location more accurately.</p>
<h3 id="2-Methods-Of-Object-Tracking"><a href="#2-Methods-Of-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="2. Methods Of Object Tracking"></a>2. Methods Of Object Tracking</h3><p>Here’re some methods of Object Tracking:</p>
<p><strong>OpenCV-Based Object Tracking</strong></p>
<p><strong>OpenCV Object Tracking</strong> method is widely used because it offers several built-in functions designed specifically for this purpose, such as GOTURN, MIL, MediandFlow, and CSRT. The tracker type you select will depend on your specific application design. Each tracker has its pros and cons, so there is not a single type of tracker ideal for all applications.</p>
<p><strong>MDNet</strong></p>
<p>Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Network Tracker is a convolutional neural-based visual tracker and has won the VOT2015 challenge. Moreover, it is composed of domain-specific layers, branches, and multiple shared layers.</p>
<p>The MDNetT tracker is a deep neural network that is trained on numerous Object Tracking datasets. The tracker is designed to work in multiple domains, including video, text, and images.</p>
<p><strong>DeepSort</strong></p>
<p>DeepSort algorithm can track objects in real-time and uses YOLO v3 to compute the bounding boxes around the objects in a frame.</p>
<p>DeepSort uses Kalman filter from Simple Online and Realtime Tracking algorithm and an identification model, ReID to interlink bounding boxes and object tracks.</p>
<p><strong>ROLO</strong></p>
<p>ROLO is a novel Object Tracking method that uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn object-specific Spatio-temporal representations. This method works with YOLO, an object detection algorithm, and an LTSM for determining the trajectory of an object.</p>

The powerful backup: OpenCV</h2><p>We have demonstrated how powerful OpenCV Tracking is and how it works. However, do you wonder what OpenCV is? How it supports the tracking goals being achieved? In this part, we will focus on OpenCV and help you better understand the the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="1-What-Is-OpenCV"><a href="#1-What-Is-OpenCV" class="headerlink" title="1. What Is OpenCV?"></a>1. What Is OpenCV?</h3><p>OpenCV is a powerful library that allows you to perform image processing, deep learning, machine learning, and computer vision tasks on live video feeds. Moreover, it can be used to detect objects, track their movements, and recognize faces.</p>
<p>It can help process the data that have videos and images and has been used in various applications, such as object recognition and detection, autonomous cars, robots, medical image analysis, automated surveillance, and anomaly detection.</p>

What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?"></a>Part 3. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?</h2><p>As what has been mentioned above, the use of object tracking is versatile. However, there are some challenges associated with Object Tracking, such as:</p>
<p><strong>Background Clutter:</strong> The background can impact extracting an object’s features. If the background is more densely populated, detecting or tracking the object of interest can be more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Occlusion:</strong> This is a phenomenon where the object being tracked is affected by the background or foreground. This causes the tracking algorithm to get confused due to multiple objects coming close together, hence, losing track of the object.</p>
<p><strong>Varying spatial scales:</strong> Varying spatial scales refer to the target object being of a different size or shape, which can confuse the algorithm, leading to errors.</p>
<p><strong>Training and Tracking Speed:</strong> If the object is moving too fast or is too small, it can be difficult to track. Therefore, the tracking module has to be designed to track, identify, and localize objects in a matter of seconds.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process-1"><a href="#Part-4-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process"></a>Part 4. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process</h2><p>After the introduction of object tracking technically, let’s learn about its mechanism of it from two sides: periods of the working process and the way it tracks.</p>
<h3 id="1-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process-1"><a href="#1-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process"></a>1. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process</h3><p>Following are the stages of the Object Tracking process:</p>
<p><strong>Target Initialization</strong></p>
<p>Target initialization is the first step in Object Tracking and involves defining the targets or objects of interest and drawing a bounding box around them in the initial frame. After that, the tracker has to detect the position of the object in the frame while drawing the bounding box.</p>
<p><strong>Appearance Modeling</strong></p>
<p>Appearance modeling is important for understanding how an object will look under different circumstances. If the object being tracked changes appearance due to different lighting, angle, or speed, the tracking algorithm may lose its information and the object itself. Therefore, it has to be conducted to let the algorithm detect the changes and distortion.</p>
<p><strong>Motion Estimation</strong></p>
<p>Motion estimation entails the capacity of the model to anticipate an object’s future position with precision.</p>
<p><strong>Target Positioning</strong></p>
<p>Motion estimation is a process of approximating the most likely region where an object could be present. After the object’s location is approximated, a visual model can be used to determine the target’s location more accurately.</p>
<h3 id="2-Methods-Of-Object-Tracking-1"><a href="#2-Methods-Of-Object-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Methods Of Object Tracking"></a>2. Methods Of Object Tracking</h3><p>Here’re some methods of Object Tracking:</p>
<p><strong>OpenCV-Based Object Tracking</strong></p>
<p><strong>OpenCV Object Tracking</strong> method is widely used because it offers several built-in functions designed specifically for this purpose, such as GOTURN, MIL, MediandFlow, and CSRT. The tracker type you select will depend on your specific application design. Each tracker has its pros and cons, so there is not a single type of tracker ideal for all applications.</p>
<p><strong>MDNet</strong></p>
<p>Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Network Tracker is a convolutional neural-based visual tracker and has won the VOT2015 challenge. Moreover, it is composed of domain-specific layers, branches, and multiple shared layers.</p>
<p>The MDNetT tracker is a deep neural network that is trained on numerous Object Tracking datasets. The tracker is designed to work in multiple domains, including video, text, and images.</p>
<p><strong>DeepSort</strong></p>
<p>DeepSort algorithm can track objects in real-time and uses YOLO v3 to compute the bounding boxes around the objects in a frame.</p>
<p>DeepSort uses Kalman filter from Simple Online and Realtime Tracking algorithm and an identification model, ReID to interlink bounding boxes and object tracks.</p>
<p><strong>ROLO</strong></p>
<p>ROLO is a novel Object Tracking method that uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn object-specific Spatio-temporal representations. This method works with YOLO, an object detection algorithm, and an LTSM for determining the trajectory of an object.</p>

The powerful backup: OpenCV</h2><p>We have demonstrated how powerful OpenCV Tracking is and how it works. However, do you wonder what OpenCV is? How it supports the tracking goals being achieved? In this part, we will focus on OpenCV and help you better understand the the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="1-What-Is-OpenCV-1"><a href="#1-What-Is-OpenCV-1" class="headerlink" title="1. What Is OpenCV?"></a>1. What Is OpenCV?</h3><p>OpenCV is a powerful library that allows you to perform image processing, deep learning, machine learning, and computer vision tasks on live video feeds. Moreover, it can be used to detect objects, track their movements, and recognize faces.</p>
<p>It can help process the data that have videos and images and has been used in various applications, such as object recognition and detection, autonomous cars, robots, medical image analysis, automated surveillance, and anomaly detection.</p>

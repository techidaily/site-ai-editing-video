<p>After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.</p>
<p>You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.</p>
<p>You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.</p>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.</p>

<h3 id="GIFROCKET"><a href="#GIFROCKET" class="headerlink" title="GIFROCKET"></a><strong>GIFROCKET</strong></h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Mac</p>
<p>GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you’ve downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive interface</li>
<li>Change quality and file size of the outputted file</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the <em>Settings</em> button. Here you’ll get three fields.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the <em>Hours</em>: <em>Minutes</em>: <em>Seconds</em> layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click <em>X</em>, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.</p>
</li>

When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps’ commonly crappy and blurry gifs.</p>
<p>You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It’s a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Importing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<h2 id="2-Customization-of-Pictures"><a href="#2-Customization-of-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="2. Customization of Pictures"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Customization of Pictures</strong></h2><p>Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.</p>
<p>Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.</p>

<li><strong>Customization of Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Gifox</strong></p>
<h3 id="1-Record-Your-Screen"><a href="#1-Record-Your-Screen" class="headerlink" title="1. Record Your Screen"></a>1. <strong>Record Your Screen</strong></h3><p>After clicking the fox icon in the menu bar, you can find the buttons to record the screen on the left side of the interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>Gifox provides two modes for recording the screen – area and window. This means you can record part of the window or choose to record the full window.</p>
<p>For an area recording, Gifox allows you the freedom to select the area. You can select any area by dragging your mouse from corner to corner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>

<p>Gifox also offers shortcuts so that you don’t have to always open the icon from the menu bar. This makes it even easier to use as a daily utility.</p>

All that remains is to add the appropriate captions and adjust the GIF’s export size, and you’re done. If you are a professional, the app even allows you to make more precise edits and trim a clip at specific time frames.</p>
<p>Once you’ve completed all of this and are satisfied with the end result, the next step is simple. Users can choose to save the GIF to their GIPHY account or share it directly with their friends and family.</p>

<p>After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.</p>
<p>You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.</p>
<p>You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.</p>

<h3 id="GIFROCKET-1"><a href="#GIFROCKET-1" class="headerlink" title="GIFROCKET"></a><strong>GIFROCKET</strong></h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Mac</p>
<p>GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you’ve downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive interface</li>
<li>Change quality and file size of the outputted file</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the <em>Settings</em> button. Here you’ll get three fields.</li>
</ol>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the <em>Hours</em>: <em>Minutes</em>: <em>Seconds</em> layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click <em>X</em>, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.</p>

<p>PicGIF is yet another app for Mac users to express their contemporary entertainment in the form of a GIF. When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps’ commonly crappy and blurry gifs.</p>
<p>You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It’s a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.</p>
<h3 id="Features-1"><a href="#Features-1" class="headerlink" title="Features:"></a><strong>Features:</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Support a vast number of file formats</li>
<li>Support hundreds of image formats like JPEG, TIFF, BMP, PNG, TGA, RAW, PIC, etc., and any image size.</li>
<li>Support almost all common video formats: MOV, MPEG, MP4, M4V, 3GP, AVI, and more.</li>
<li>Support combining multiple formats – images, GIFs, and videos into a new single GIF.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The PicGIF software is safe to use</li>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Importing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.</p>

<h2 id="2-Customization-of-Pictures-1"><a href="#2-Customization-of-Pictures-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Customization of Pictures"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Customization of Pictures</strong></h2><p>Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.</p>
<p>Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Customization of Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.</p>

<h3 id="1-Record-Your-Screen-1"><a href="#1-Record-Your-Screen-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Record Your Screen"></a>1. <strong>Record Your Screen</strong></h3><p>After clicking the fox icon in the menu bar, you can find the buttons to record the screen on the left side of the interface.</p>

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>Gifox provides two modes for recording the screen – area and window. This means you can record part of the window or choose to record the full window.</p>
<p>For an area recording, Gifox allows you the freedom to select the area. You can select any area by dragging your mouse from corner to corner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>When using the window recording mode, one great feature is that it doesn’t matter if several windows are overlapping. You can just select the one you want to record, and Gifox will ignore the other window.</p>
<p>Gifox also offers shortcuts so that you don’t have to always open the icon from the menu bar. This makes it even easier to use as a daily utility.</p>

<p>After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.</p>
<p>You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.</p>
<p>You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.</p>

<h3 id="GIFROCKET-2"><a href="#GIFROCKET-2" class="headerlink" title="GIFROCKET"></a><strong>GIFROCKET</strong></h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Mac</p>
<p>GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you’ve downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.</p>

<li>Intuitive interface</li>
<li>Change quality and file size of the outputted file</li>

<ol>
<li>After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the <em>Settings</em> button. Here you’ll get three fields.</li>
</ol>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the <em>Hours</em>: <em>Minutes</em>: <em>Seconds</em> layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click <em>X</em>, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.</p>

<p>You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It’s a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Importing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.</p>

<h2 id="2-Customization-of-Pictures-2"><a href="#2-Customization-of-Pictures-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Customization of Pictures"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Customization of Pictures</strong></h2><p>Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.</p>
<p>Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.</p>

<li><strong>Customization of Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.</p>

<p>After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.</p>
<p>You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.</p>
<p>You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.</p>

<h3 id="GIFROCKET-3"><a href="#GIFROCKET-3" class="headerlink" title="GIFROCKET"></a><strong>GIFROCKET</strong></h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Mac</p>
<p>GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you’ve downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive interface</li>
<li>Change quality and file size of the outputted file</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.</li>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the <em>Settings</em> button. Here you’ll get three fields.</li>
</ol>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the <em>Hours</em>: <em>Minutes</em>: <em>Seconds</em> layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click <em>X</em>, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.</p>

<h3 id="PICGIF-3"><a href="#PICGIF-3" class="headerlink" title="PICGIF"></a><strong>PICGIF</strong></h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Mac</p>
<p>PicGIF is yet another app for Mac users to express their contemporary entertainment in the form of a GIF. When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps’ commonly crappy and blurry gifs.</p>
<p>You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It’s a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.</p>
<h3 id="Features-3"><a href="#Features-3" class="headerlink" title="Features:"></a><strong>Features:</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Support a vast number of file formats</li>

<li>Support almost all common video formats: MOV, MPEG, MP4, M4V, 3GP, AVI, and more.</li>
<li>Support combining multiple formats – images, GIFs, and videos into a new single GIF.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The PicGIF software is safe to use</li>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Importing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.</p>

<h2 id="2-Customization-of-Pictures-3"><a href="#2-Customization-of-Pictures-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Customization of Pictures"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Customization of Pictures</strong></h2><p>Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.</p>
<p>Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Customization of Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.</p>

<h3 id="1-Record-Your-Screen-3"><a href="#1-Record-Your-Screen-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Record Your Screen"></a>1. <strong>Record Your Screen</strong></h3><p>After clicking the fox icon in the menu bar, you can find the buttons to record the screen on the left side of the interface.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>Gifox provides two modes for recording the screen – area and window. This means you can record part of the window or choose to record the full window.</p>
<p>For an area recording, Gifox allows you the freedom to select the area. You can select any area by dragging your mouse from corner to corner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>When using the window recording mode, one great feature is that it doesn’t matter if several windows are overlapping. You can just select the one you want to record, and Gifox will ignore the other window.</p>
<p>Gifox also offers shortcuts so that you don’t have to always open the icon from the menu bar. This makes it even easier to use as a daily utility.</p>

<h3 id="3-Compress-3"><a href="#3-Compress-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Compress"></a>3. <strong>Compress</strong></h3><p>If you’re sharing a GIF on the internet, you’re going to like it to be of good quality but with the smallest file size possible. Gifox makes this possible. Available in preferences, the compress settings allow you to have full control over the quality of the GIF.

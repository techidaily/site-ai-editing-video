<h3 id="10Neo-Tokyo-3"><a href="#10Neo-Tokyo-3" class="headerlink" title="10Neo-Tokyo"></a>10Neo-Tokyo</h3><p><strong>Major Attractions</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Compiling 3 short stories into a single movie, this one is an experiment of brilliance in the anime world</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The engaging storylines of each of the 3 shorts will never let you have enough of the movie with a desire to stream one more time</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The directors aim to tell the stories in an animated poetic style that suits the theme of the plot.</p>
<p>Introduced to the anime cinema in 1987, Neo-Tokyo was initially addressed as Manie Manie: Labyrinth Tales. The movie is a split-up craft of the biggest names in the anime world and features shots directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Katsuhiro Otomo and Rintaro. The film got its existing name during its re-release in 1989 by Streamline Pictures to avoid a title clash with Otomo’s allied production Akira, that had hit the screens in the same year.</p>
<p>Viewing through the specific shorts in particular, the ‘Labyrinth Labyrinthos’ directed by Rintaro is inspired by German Expressionism in cohesion with the craft of Salvador Dali. The plot follows Sachi, a notorious young girl who, via the dresser’s looking glass, gets drawn into the gloomy space of a hallucinating quirkiness, along with Cicerone, her pet kitten.</p>
<p>As of ‘The Running Man’ directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, the latter is an ugly science fiction noir short that draws its inspiration from Blade Runner. The storyteller here is a sports correspondent who gets the privilege to see Jack Hugh’s last race. This legendary sports star of a dangerous running tournament was then reported to have imbibed fatal psionic tendencies.</p>
<p>Reserving the best for the last, here enters ‘Construction Cancellation Order’, the last short directed by Katsuhiro Omoto. The story progresses with the journey of Tsutomu Sugioka, who is sent to a fictitious and remote area in Aloana Republic, a city in South America by his seniors. His job is to shut down Facility 444, a remote construction project of his Japanese company.</p>
<p>Put collectively, Neo-Tokyo is a masterpiece of technical excellence that showcases the bright future of amine movies, provided that they are crafted by the most unique film creators of the anime world.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Comments</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The movie is a fantastic and cohesive alignment of 3 non-connected stories in one frame to represent an integration that is nothing short of magic</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The movie is a gorgeous play of twisted blocks and designs that conveniently takes the shape of a really great anthology flick</p>

<p>Using Plastuer or BioniX wallpaper changer as a 3rd party software is the best way to use animated gifs for your desktop.</p>
<p>As a starting point, we’ll cover plastuer, which uses WebGL and chromium-browser to make gifs as your background.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The software includes selecting different screens where you want the wallpaper to appear, making it possible to apply it to different screens at once.</p>
<p>To select the gif you want:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can paste the URL of the gif you want to use.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also use the “create playlist” field to add multiple gifs as your background.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can select a file from your device using the “select file” option.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Or you can choose from hundreds of gifs present in the plastuer library.</p>

To choose files from the device itself, you will have to use the shortcut command “CTRL+F”, or you can also choose to insert the URL of the gif you want to use as your background.</p>
<p>Once your image gets uploaded into the software, double click on it to set it as your windows wallpaper. You can also choose a launch of gifs, create a playlist, and select the timer to change wallpaper regularly.</p>

<p>Working towards adding emojis in your product or company presentations or ad campaigns caters to convey the product information in a unique style of its own by adding an extra bit of liveliness to your brand.</p>
<p>You should however, be cautious while using emojis to promote your brand, lest these may end up crowding the presentation snippet.

<p>Another way of making an impressive use of emojis in your promotional media posts is creating engaging feature lists of your brand, or adding the same to the product headlines, while giving them an extra impact. Such graphic creativity will surely put your brand ahead of the numerous counterparts on promotional business sites.</p>

Adding an emoji in your brand promotion strategies helps to establish a great deal of emotional connection of the same with your target audience, while making them relate to the regular inclusion of these graphic elements in their social media conversations.</p>
<p>Working towards adding emojis in your product or company presentations or ad campaigns caters to convey the product information in a unique style of its own by adding an extra bit of liveliness to your brand.</p>
<p>You should however, be cautious while using emojis to promote your brand, lest these may end up crowding the presentation snippet. It is a wise decision to use a single or couple of emojis at the end of a text based content, rather than stuffing the same with a series of emojis to avoid the distraction of audience.</p>
<p>Another way of making an impressive use of emojis in your promotional media posts is creating engaging feature lists of your brand, or adding the same to the product headlines, while giving them an extra impact. Such graphic creativity will surely put your brand ahead of the numerous counterparts on promotional business sites.</p>

<p>While using emojis alone can make the task a bit difficult, an intelligent combination of the latter with cohesive text elements can effectively cater towards delivering a top rated promotional output, while adding an extra bit of meaning and depth to the same.</p>
<p>When promoting your product across social media platforms that have a restriction on the maximum number of characters within a single post or message, using emojis can compensate for the text you would otherwise prefer to add.

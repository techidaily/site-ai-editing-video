But to get to the end, there are several steps involved in the production process, and not every instance of it is perfect. But we all know, editing does often help iron out any kinks, with its ability to solve basic problems, like footage that is askew, or upside down. Thus with the steps listed in this article we will help you understand how you can rotate videos to ensure your edited project looks as intended.</p>
<p>This particular article considers the pre-installed Windows Media Player and WonderShare Filmora.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>We documented the steps in this guide with Windows Media Player</em> <em>(on a device running Windows 10</em> <em>) and WonderShare Filmora.</em></p>
<h2 id="How-to-Rotate-Videos-with-Windows-Media-Player"><a href="#How-to-Rotate-Videos-with-Windows-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="How to Rotate Videos with Windows Media Player?"></a>How to Rotate Videos with Windows Media Player?</h2><p>Imagine you’re in a situation where you have gone ahead and finished the filming portion of a project on your smartphone but realise that the capture footage is upside down. Fortunately, this sort of a scenario is a common occurrence and it has quite a simple fix. If you look around the gallery app on your phone, you should be able to rotate the footage there itself, but if you’ve already moved it over to your laptop, hopping into a video editor can get this done in a jiffy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you were planning to do this with the pre-installed Windows Media Player, <em>you will not be able to rotate the clip</em>. The software is only capable of being used as a Media Player that can help keep track of stored videos in a neat and easy to view format. It also has the ability to burn inserted discs, although we doubt any modern laptop comes with a disc drive.</p>
<p>Hence, to rotate video and still ensure its compatible with Windows Media Player, you can use free tools like VLC Media Player or Wondershare Filmora. The steps on how to use Wondershare Filmora to rotate video clips have been elaborated ahead in this article.</p>
<h3 id="TIPS-FOR-WINDOWS-MEDIA-PLAYER"><a href="#TIPS-FOR-WINDOWS-MEDIA-PLAYER" class="headerlink" title="TIPS FOR WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER"></a><strong>TIPS FOR WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER</strong></h3><p>In case you want to use Windows Media Player as your default software to manage stored content, read this section to understand how you can control displayed video libraries.</p>
<p>While Windows Media Player will pull all compatible files present in the Default Video Library, you can customise the information made available by using the Organises Function.</p>
<p>To configure the Videos Section to display specific content follow the steps listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on Organize.</li>
<li>Then move onto Manage Libraries</li>
<li>Now click on Videos.</li>

<p>In Adobe After Effects, there are two <strong>Face Tracking</strong> features, i.e., Outline Only and Detailed Feature. The former will help only to track the face, while the latter provides detailed data on different facial features to help you change the eye color, mouth movements, etc.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will explore <strong>Face Tracking,</strong> its applications, how it works, and its challenges and drawbacks. We will also provide an easy-to-follow guide on using the Face Tracking feature in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Face-Tracking"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Face-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Face Tracking"></a>Part 1. What Is Face Tracking</h2><p>Face Tracking is a process of identifying or detecting the areas of the face, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth, in a video or image. This effect can be used to track and animate face replacements, retouch footage, or add effects to a user’s face in live footage.</p>
<p>Where It Is Applied</p>
<p>Face Tracking can be used for a variety of applications, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replacing One Face With Another:</strong> This is helpful if you need to change the face of a character in video footage.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Automatic Effects:</strong> With this feature, you can apply effects to a face in live footage.</li>
<li><strong>Retouching Footage</strong>: Face Tracking can help you retouch a face in a video clip, for instance, you can smooth it or change the skin tone, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Robotic Devices:</strong> Certain robots use Face Tracking technology to perform human tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Face-Tracking-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Face-Tracking-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Does Face Tracking Work?"></a>Part 2. How Does Face Tracking Work?</h2><p>Face Tracking algorithms usually begin by detecting facial landmarks, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. Once detected, the AI algorithms use them to track the face as it moves. This information can be used to perform various tasks, such as identifying the person’s emotions or estimating their head pose.</p>
<p>Face Tracking technology is constantly improving and is now being used in various new applications, such as to create 3D models of people’s faces, control robotic devices, and create more realistic avatars for virtual reality systems.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-The-Challenges-And-Drawbacks-Of-Face-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-The-Challenges-And-Drawbacks-Of-Face-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. The Challenges And Drawbacks Of Face Tracking"></a>Part 3. The Challenges And Drawbacks Of Face Tracking</h2><p>Face Tracking is a technology that has been growing in popularity in recent years. This technology allows computers to detect and track human faces in real-time. While Face Tracking has many potential applications, some challenges and drawbacks also need to be considered:</p>
<p>One of the main challenges with Face Tracking is that it can be difficult to track faces in different lighting conditions. Faces can also be obstructed by objects such as hats or glasses. Another challenge is that things like photographs, makeup, or masks can fool face tracking.</p>
<p>Some privacy concerns need to be considered when using Face Tracking. This technology can be used to collect sensitive data about people without their consent.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges and drawbacks, Face Tracking remains a promising technology with many potential applications, and it can help with many tasks such as identifying a perpetrator, finding a missing person, better security measures in banks and airports, and many more.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-The-Face-Tracking-In-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-4-The-Face-Tracking-In-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. The Face Tracking In After Effects"></a>Part 4. The Face Tracking In After Effects</h2><p>Adobe After Effects is a useful and powerful tool that can be used for various purposes, including Face Tracking. This feature enables you to track the movement of a person’s face and detect specific parts of a face, including eyes, nose, mouth, etc., to let you work with these facial features individually.</p>
<p>For instance, you can change the mouth movement or pupil color without frame-by-frame adjustments. Moreover, you can measure facial features to see the details, such as how open the eye or mouth is.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<p>Here’s a simple and quick rundown of the features of Face Tracking in Adobe After Effects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Help you detect faces and provide isolated data points to help you refine the content.</li>
<li>Retouch the face in a video without adjusting it frame by frame.</li>
<li>Let you export the tracking data to Character Animator for creating performance-based animations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Function</p>
<p>There are two Face Tracking functions in the Tracker panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Face Tracking (Outline Only):</strong> This feature will only help you to outline the face in a video clip.</li>
<li><strong>Face Tracking (Detailed Features):</strong> This option will help you if you want to detect the different facial features and parts, including the eye, pupil, eyebrow, mouth, and nose. You can also take exact measurements of the features.</li>
</ul>

The Guidance Of Using Face Tracking In After Effects"></a>Part 5. The Guidance Of Using Face Tracking In After Effects</h2><p>Follow the guidelines below to use Face Tracking in After Effects:</p>
<p>Face Tracking To Outline A Face</p>
<p>Step1Launch the <strong>After Effects</strong> software and click <strong>“File”</strong> in the top <strong>Toolbar.</strong> Select <strong>Import</strong> and click <strong>“File.”</strong> Find the video footage and add it to the <strong>Project panel.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adding-the-footage-to-the-project-panel.jpg"
                      alt="adding the footage to the project panel"
                ></p>
<p>Step2To add a new layer, drag and drop the video footage from the <strong>Project Panel</strong> to the <strong>Composition.</strong></p>
<p>Step3Drag the blue <strong>current-time indicator</strong> in the <strong>Timeline</strong> to a frame showing the face’s upright and front view.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragging-the-blue-cti-to-a-frame-with-the-face-in-the-upright-and-front-position.jpg"
                      alt="dragging the blue cti to a frame with the face in the upright and front position"
                ></p>
<p>Step4Now, you have to draw a <strong>closed mask loosely</strong> around the face. This helps identify the region for locating the facial features. The top mask is used for <strong>Face Tracking</strong> if you have selected multiple masks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/creating-a-closed-mask-loosely-around-the-face.jpg"
                      alt="creating a closed mask loosely around the face"
                ></p>
<p>Step5Click the <strong>“Window”</strong> option from the top <strong>Toolbar</strong> and scroll down to <strong>“Tracker.”</strong> Select <strong>“Face Tracking (Outline Only)” as</strong> the tracking method in the <strong>Tracker Panel.</strong></p>
<p>Step6To make sure the tracking is working correctly, track forward or backward one frame at a time and click the <strong>“Start”</strong> button to start the analysis process of the frames. Once finished, you can find the <strong>Face Tracking data</strong> within the Composition.</p>
<p>Tracking Detailed Features And Extracting Facial Measurements</p>
<p>For detailed face features tracking, do the following steps in sequence:</p>
<p>Step1Import your file and add it to the <strong>Project</strong> in the <strong>After Effects</strong>. Drop and drag the video clip into a <strong>Composition</strong> from the <strong>Project Panel</strong> to add a layer.</p>
<p>Step2Position the <strong>CTI</strong> to a frame showing the upright and front view of the face, and draw a <strong>closed mask loosely</strong> around the face to define the search region to find the facial features.</p>
<p>Step3Click the <strong>“Window”</strong> option, scroll down to <strong>Tracker</strong> and select it. Choose the **“Face Tracking (Detailed Features)**” option as the tracking method.</p>

                      alt="selecting the face tracking option"
                ></p>
<p>Step4Track forward or backward to check the tracking process, and click the <strong>“Start”</strong> button to initiate the analysis process.</p>
<p>Step5Once the analysis is done, you can find the tracking data within a new effect, <strong>“Face Track Point.”</strong> To access the face tracking data, go to <strong>“Window”</strong> and select <strong>“Effects Control”</strong> to go to the <strong>Effects Panel</strong> or check within the <strong>Composition.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="face tracking data within the composition"
                ></p>
<p>Step6Move the <strong>CTI</strong> to a frame displaying <strong>neutral facial expressions</strong> or is in the rest pose. The measurements of a face on other frames are dependent on the rest pose frame. Now, click <strong>“Set Rest Pose”</strong> in the Tracker Panel and select <strong>“Extract &amp; Copy Face Measurements”</strong> to add the Face Measurement layer.</p>
<p>Step7When the Face Measurements effect layer is added, <strong>keyframes</strong> are automatically generated based on the <strong>Face Track Points keyframe data.</strong> You can copy the data from the system clipboard for use in <strong>Adobe Character Animator.</strong></p>

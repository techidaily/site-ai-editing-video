                      alt="DVD Slideshow Builder Deluxe- Mode Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Software Registration</strong></p>
<p>For an extensive working flexibility it is recommended to purchase a licensed version of the software program. All you need to do is, navigate to and click on the ‘Register’ option at the top right corner of the program’s launch screen, followed by choosing the ‘Buy Now’ option. Follow the successive screen to place your order.</p>
<p>As soon as your order gets validated, you will receive an auto-generated confirmation e-mail containing the registration code within. Proceed with copying and pasting the same, along with the licensed e-mail to see the <strong>DVD Slideshow Builder Deluxe</strong> program get activated.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Browse Through the Program Interface</strong></p>
<p>As you enter into the program’s workspace after completing the registration process, the latter’s welcome interface greets you with the following elements:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Navigation Bar</strong></p>
<p>The navigation bar at the top consists of the entire set of slideshow editing functions, including the specific effects, personalized custom styles and output options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Library</strong></p>
<p>The program library is a host of slideshow contents that vary in accordance with the specific function of the ‘Navigation Bar’ you are working with. For instance, if you are currently within the ‘Organize’ tab, the library presents before you a list of the created slideshow projects.</p>
<p>Further, in the ‘Personalize’ editing tab, you get to see the variety of editing tools, like, clipart, effects, styles, intro&#x2F;credit and pre-audio options, along with a set of other features. The output options and settings get displayed in the library within the ‘Create’ tab of the navigation bar.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Preview Window</strong></p>
<p>It is here that you can watch a display and run of the current slide of your created presentation on the editor’s Timeline or Storyboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Storyboard&#x2F;Timeline</strong></p>
<p>These are the regions within the program’s workspace where you can work with creating and editing your slideshow presentation. If you choose to work in the previously explained ‘Personalize’ mode, there is an option to switch between the Storyboard and the Timeline whenever the need arises.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Switching Between the Working Modes</strong></p>

You can do this by reaching to and clicking on the ‘Blue Button’ at the top, beside the ‘Navigation Bar’, followed by selecting the ‘Switch to Advanced&#x2F;Standard Mode’ option from the dropdown menu that appears next.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Creating a Slideshow Presentation</strong></p>

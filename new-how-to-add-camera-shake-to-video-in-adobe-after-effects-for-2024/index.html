<p>So you’ve shot your video with good camera technique and shot it on a good camera; how can you make it look like you shot it on an old PXL 2000? Well, the answer is to add a little camera shake to the footage. If you’ve ever been to a theme park, then you’ve likely seen the effect of camera shake. Video camera shake can be a powerful tool for telling a story and creating an impactful scene. It helps to build suspense and make the video more realistic. This article will show you how to add camera shake to your videos using Adobe After Effects.</p>

You know, those cool shake effects that you may have seen on an amateur or professional video on the web? Well, if you have, then you probably thought it was impossible. The camera shake effect is a technique applied to the clips where shaky camera movements cause the image to appear more cinematic and real. Applying a camera shake effect is to hide your flaws when shooting a video.</p>
<p>Camera shake is often mistaken for poor cinematography. It can enhance your video. For instance, if you’re filming something like a car chase or any other scene where there’s lots of movement and action, the inclusion of a camera shake can help make it more realistic.</p>
<p>A camera shake effect can be an excellent way of adding a sense of realism to your videos. Whether you’re making a video that’s meant to be taken as a real scene, such as one depicting a robbery, or one that’s supposed to be shot in a documentary style, such as making a movie, you can use this as an effective tool. You can consider adding camera shakes to your videos due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This camera shake effect makes your video more creative. If you want to make, your video different from those other businesses produce, adding this effect will be a good idea.</li>
<li>Your audience will be able to relate better to your video if they’ve seen similar videos before.</li>
<li>Adding a camera shake to your video will make it more interesting and engaging for your viewers.</li>
<li>It’s a great way to mask any mistakes you might have made during the video production. After all, we aren’t perfect humans, so we can’t make perfect videos every time!”</li>
<li>You can use camera shakes to simulate the feeling of being in an environment that is free from control (such as being on a boat).</li>
<li>You can use them to create a sense of urgency for the viewer&#x2F;audience by adding motion blur to the sequence.</li>
</ul>

Using it correctly can add subtle motion to a static frame, emphasize an important object, and even make a character quiver in fear! In this tutorial, you will learn how to effectively use the wiggle expression to affect a layer throughout the Composition.</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-Select-the-layer-you-want-to-shake-from-your-After-Effects-file"><a href="#Step-1-Select-the-layer-you-want-to-shake-from-your-After-Effects-file" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Select the layer you want to shake from your After Effects file"></a>Step 1. Select the layer you want to shake from your After Effects file</h3><p>Suppose you have an image or video of an object and want to apply it to shake effect, then it is quite easy. Just follow the steps described below.</p>

Press the alt&#x2F;option key, then click the stopwatch next to “position.”"></a>Step 2. Press the alt&#x2F;option key, then click the stopwatch next to “position.”</h3><p>You are adding an “expression” to the timeline when the position text turns red, and you begin typing. Using a coding language adapted from javascript, you can apply complex motion to layers.</p>
<p>By pressing the alt&#x2F;option again on the stopwatch, you can edit your expression anytime-or by clicking the arrow beside “position” and then double-clicking the text in the timeline.</p>

Enter “Wiggle (3,8)” and adjust the settings accordingly"></a>Step 3. Enter “Wiggle (3,8)” and adjust the settings accordingly</h3><p>In this expression, the first number indicates the frequency of Wiggle – basically, how quickly it appears to tremble. Its amplitude is the second number, which indicates how far it moves. The numbers are adjustable as you wish. Layers will shake dramatically but slowly when they use Wiggle (2,40). The “Wiggle (10,3)” command makes a layer move quickly without too much movement in one direction.</p>
<h3 id="Step-4-Adjust-the-frame-rate-of-your-Composition"><a href="#Step-4-Adjust-the-frame-rate-of-your-Composition" class="headerlink" title="Step 4. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition"></a>Step 4. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition</h3><p>In order to make the overall effect more “choppy,” you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition&gt; Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as “8” if you want a choppy feel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-3.jpg"
                      alt="how to use camera shake in premiere pro - adjust frame rate"
                ></p>
<p>Your entire Composition will become choppier if you reduce the frame rate, so it might not be worth it if you have other moving elements in your Composition. Only adjust the frame rate of the layer containing the wiggling object if you want it to affect that layer.</p>

You know, those cool shake effects that you may have seen on an amateur or professional video on the web? Well, if you have, then you probably thought it was impossible. The camera shake effect is a technique applied to the clips where shaky camera movements cause the image to appear more cinematic and real. Applying a camera shake effect is to hide your flaws when shooting a video.</p>
<p>Camera shake is often mistaken for poor cinematography. It can enhance your video. For instance, if you’re filming something like a car chase or any other scene where there’s lots of movement and action, the inclusion of a camera shake can help make it more realistic.</p>
<p>A camera shake effect can be an excellent way of adding a sense of realism to your videos. Whether you’re making a video that’s meant to be taken as a real scene, such as one depicting a robbery, or one that’s supposed to be shot in a documentary style, such as making a movie, you can use this as an effective tool. You can consider adding camera shakes to your videos due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This camera shake effect makes your video more creative. If you want to make, your video different from those other businesses produce, adding this effect will be a good idea.</li>
<li>Your audience will be able to relate better to your video if they’ve seen similar videos before.</li>
<li>Adding a camera shake to your video will make it more interesting and engaging for your viewers.</li>
<li>It’s a great way to mask any mistakes you might have made during the video production. After all, we aren’t perfect humans, so we can’t make perfect videos every time!”</li>
<li>You can use camera shakes to simulate the feeling of being in an environment that is free from control (such as being on a boat).</li>
<li>You can use them to create a sense of urgency for the viewer&#x2F;audience by adding motion blur to the sequence.</li>

Using it correctly can add subtle motion to a static frame, emphasize an important object, and even make a character quiver in fear! In this tutorial, you will learn how to effectively use the wiggle expression to affect a layer throughout the Composition.</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-Select-the-layer-you-want-to-shake-from-your-After-Effects-file-1"><a href="#Step-1-Select-the-layer-you-want-to-shake-from-your-After-Effects-file-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1.

Just follow the steps described below.</p>

Press the alt&#x2F;option key, then click the stopwatch next to “position.”</h3><p>You are adding an “expression” to the timeline when the position text turns red, and you begin typing. Using a coding language adapted from javascript, you can apply complex motion to layers.</p>
<p>By pressing the alt&#x2F;option again on the stopwatch, you can edit your expression anytime-or by clicking the arrow beside “position” and then double-clicking the text in the timeline.</p>

Its amplitude is the second number, which indicates how far it moves. The numbers are adjustable as you wish. Layers will shake dramatically but slowly when they use Wiggle (2,40). The “Wiggle (10,3)” command makes a layer move quickly without too much movement in one direction.</p>
<h3 id="Step-4-Adjust-the-frame-rate-of-your-Composition-1"><a href="#Step-4-Adjust-the-frame-rate-of-your-Composition-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 4. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition"></a>Step 4. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition</h3><p>In order to make the overall effect more “choppy,” you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition&gt; Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as “8” if you want a choppy feel.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Your entire Composition will become choppier if you reduce the frame rate, so it might not be worth it if you have other moving elements in your Composition. Only adjust the frame rate of the layer containing the wiggling object if you want it to affect that layer.</p>

<p>Camera shake is often mistaken for poor cinematography. It can enhance your video. For instance, if you’re filming something like a car chase or any other scene where there’s lots of movement and action, the inclusion of a camera shake can help make it more realistic.</p>
<p>A camera shake effect can be an excellent way of adding a sense of realism to your videos. Whether you’re making a video that’s meant to be taken as a real scene, such as one depicting a robbery, or one that’s supposed to be shot in a documentary style, such as making a movie, you can use this as an effective tool. You can consider adding camera shakes to your videos due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This camera shake effect makes your video more creative. If you want to make, your video different from those other businesses produce, adding this effect will be a good idea.</li>
<li>Your audience will be able to relate better to your video if they’ve seen similar videos before.</li>
<li>Adding a camera shake to your video will make it more interesting and engaging for your viewers.</li>
<li>It’s a great way to mask any mistakes you might have made during the video production. After all, we aren’t perfect humans, so we can’t make perfect videos every time!”</li>
<li>You can use camera shakes to simulate the feeling of being in an environment that is free from control (such as being on a boat).</li>
<li>You can use them to create a sense of urgency for the viewer&#x2F;audience by adding motion blur to the sequence.</li>
</ul>

Its amplitude is the second number, which indicates how far it moves. The numbers are adjustable as you wish. Layers will shake dramatically but slowly when they use Wiggle (2,40). The “Wiggle (10,3)” command makes a layer move quickly without too much movement in one direction.</p>

Adjust the frame rate of your Composition</h3><p>In order to make the overall effect more “choppy,” you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition&gt; Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as “8” if you want a choppy feel.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Your entire Composition will become choppier if you reduce the frame rate, so it might not be worth it if you have other moving elements in your Composition. Only adjust the frame rate of the layer containing the wiggling object if you want it to affect that layer.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Make-Subtitle-Videos"><a href="#How-to-Make-Subtitle-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Subtitle Videos"></a>How to Make Subtitle Videos</h2><p>Subtitles are very common for people who watch videos very often. It is simply the text or dialogue usually displayed at the base of the screen of a video. We often use subtitles to watch movies or television programs, play video games, etc. The subtitle makes all the difference when you are watching a video in a language different from the one you know and understand.</p>
<p>A lot of videos will be really difficult to watch when there is no knowledge of the language which the producers used in creating the video. That is where the need for subtitles is seen. It breaks language barriers to publicity of a video i.e it tries to bridge that gap of understanding that exists when you watch a video. It also assists in as little as helping you understand a video that is recorded in a language you speak but in a different accent. An American might find it a bit difficult to understand the accent used in a British movie. So basically, what subtitles do is make understanding better and easier.</p>
<h2 id="1-Types-of-Subtitle-Videos"><a href="#1-Types-of-Subtitle-Videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Types of Subtitle Videos"></a>1. Types of Subtitle Videos</h2><p>There are two (2) broad types of subtitling</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Subtitles</li>
<li>Closed subtitles</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Open Subtitles</strong></p>
<p>Open subtitles are subtitles that are included and incorporated as part of the original video and cannot be removed from the screen. No additional program or tool is required before they are activated and ready for use. Also, no additional tool is needed to edit or remove it. This is because they are part and parcel of the original video and cannot be edited. They are rooted in the original video as part of it and not just as an extension. An example of where it is used is karaoke. These subtitles cannot be switched on and off by the user.</p>
<p><strong>Close Subtitles</strong></p>
<p>Closed subtitles are more malleable than open subtitles. It is relatively easier to add or remove when compared to the open subtitles. They are substantially separate from the original video. They are usually encoded in the transmission signal of the cable or satellite technology and sent separately from the original broadcast, in this case, video. This makes it possible to remove it from the video. They are mostly found on DVDs.</p>
<p>Other classifications sometimes include a third known as soft subtitles. They usually need player support to work effectively. They are the easiest to use because of the flexibility in adding and editing.</p>
<h2 id="2-Subtitle-Formats"><a href="#2-Subtitle-Formats" class="headerlink" title="2. Subtitle Formats"></a>2. Subtitle Formats</h2><p>Subtitle formats are often represented funnily. You see extensions like .srt, .sub, .stl, .mtv, etc. They are the extensions of different subtitle formats. Let’s talk about some of them.</p>
<p><strong>SubRip:</strong> This is one of the most common formats for subtitles. Its extension is ‘.srt’ and they are also the most widely used by modern video subtitling technology. It is stored sequentially along a line with its basic timing and in a human-readable format.</p>
<p><strong>SubViewer:</strong> The sub viewer format is another popular subtitle format. It stores information about periods with tag information. Its extension is ‘.sub’.</p>
<p><strong>Micro DVD:</strong> This subtitle format is compatible with digital videos. They equally carry the ‘. sub’ extension.</p>
<p><strong>Spruce subtitle format:</strong> They usually operate in sequential periods and frames. They have the ‘.stl’ format.</p>
<h2 id="3-What-Are-Subtitles-Used-For"><a href="#3-What-Are-Subtitles-Used-For" class="headerlink" title="3. What Are Subtitles Used For?"></a>3. What Are Subtitles Used For?</h2><p>Now that we’ve known what subtitles are and the various formats they exist in, let’s take a deeper dive into what they’re used for.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing:</strong></p>
<p>You’re probably wondering what marketing is doing at the top of this list. If you work in a multi-national company which branches in different countries and continents, you will find subtitles very helpful in promotional videos for your company. On the other hand, you may not work in a multi-national company but have your business in a multi-ethnic country like Nigeria, New Guinea, Chad, etc. instead of creating videos in all the languages which apply to the people you hope to reach, you can produce one video, add subtitles for the various languages and save cost.</p>
<p><strong>Education:</strong></p>
<p>Educational videos can be produced alongside subtitles in various languages to aid learning, especially for campuses that attract foreign students who might have little to no knowledge of how to speak the language of the school.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding better deaf people:</strong></p>
<p>Subtitle for Deaf or hard-of-hearing (SDH) was introduced by the movie industry specifically made for people with hearing deficiencies. This allows them access to information they would normally be unable to hear or listen to.</p>
<p><strong>Translation:</strong></p>
<p>As already mentioned earlier, some videos are produced in languages other than the ones we understand. Subtitles help to understand what is being said in the video irrespective of the language in which it was originally produced.</p>
<p><strong>Low-quality speakers:</strong></p>
<p>Watching a video with low quality or faulty speakers can be a bit frustrating without subtitles.</p>
<p><strong>Watching videos in a noisy environment:</strong></p>
<p>We have all been in places that are noisy and we have had the need to watch a video or listen to an audio file. Subtitles come in handy at this point. They are also useful when we do not want to distract others while watching a video.</p>
<p><strong>Learn foreign languages:</strong></p>
<p>Subtitles are a very good way to learn new languages, sometimes consciously, other times it happens with any conscious effort. While watching a movie discovered ‘<em>Lo Siento’</em> means I’m sorry in Spanish while ‘_Arigatou_’ means ‘thank you in Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>Reading speed:</strong></p>
<p>If you want to improve your reading speed, subtitles equally help you do that.</p>
<h2 id="4-Subtitle-Tips-and-Tricks"><a href="#4-Subtitle-Tips-and-Tricks" class="headerlink" title="4. Subtitle Tips and Tricks"></a>4. Subtitle Tips and Tricks</h2><p>Subtitle software applications let you add captions to videos, edit them, translate them to languages of your choice, etc. Let us look at a few of them below:</p>
<p><strong>Subtitle Edit:</strong></p>
<p>Subtitle Edit is largely free software that allows users to create timecoded subtitles. Users can also import and convert subtitles from one format to another format. If you’re new to subtitling, this is a good place to start before moving up to other advanced software applications.</p>
<p><strong>Annotation Edit:</strong></p>
<p>Annotation Edit is another application but it is specific to mac users. It has a very good user-friendly interface which makes it easy software to use.</p>
<p>Other software applications are equally very useful in subtitling.</p>
<p>When creating subtitles, ensure they are automated so as not to make it difficult to read when certain colors are displayed on the screen. Timing is very important. Make sure the subtitle is properly synchronized with the actual sound being produced.</p>
<p>Use a user-friendly font style. Each font style is unique for each viewing and it speaks volumes of what the video has to say or the message it wants to pass. So, it is expedient to learn more about font style, font color, font size etc. for a better-subtitled video.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Subtitled videos are more likely to be used than videos without subtitles. So as a content creator, entrepreneur or in any field where you work with videos, adding a subtitle to your videos could be the turning point even for your organization for a wider audience.</p>

<h2 id="Easy-Ways-to-Edit-Recorded-Video"><a href="#Easy-Ways-to-Edit-Recorded-Video" class="headerlink" title="Easy Ways to Edit Recorded Video"></a>Easy Ways to Edit Recorded Video</h2><p>The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don’t need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.</p>
<p>Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you’re on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don’t have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we’ve put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you’ll need to know to make stunning films, even if you’ve never done it before. We’ll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS"></a><strong>Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS</strong></h2><p>OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It’s open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Download and Install OBS</strong></p>
<p>Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Setup Screen Recording</strong></p>
<p>The window is divided into separate parts called “docks” when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you’ll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="obs setup screen recording"
                ></p>
<p>You’ll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Customize the Recording Source</strong></p>
<p>You’ll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select “Display Capture” by clicking the “+” icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click “OK”. At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you’re ready to begin recording. When you’re finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.</p>

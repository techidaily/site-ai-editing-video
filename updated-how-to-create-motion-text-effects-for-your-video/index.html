<h2 id="Easy-Guide-to-Zoom-Video-in-VLC"><a href="#Easy-Guide-to-Zoom-Video-in-VLC" class="headerlink" title="Easy Guide to Zoom Video in VLC"></a>Easy Guide to Zoom Video in VLC</h2><p>Even though VLC Media Player is not the default video player in any operating system, most users install VLC Player separately on their computers. This is because VLC Media Player offers several useful and advanced features that the default media player like Windows Media Player lacks. There are situations when users need to zoom into certain parts of a video, and that is where VLC zoom in video feature comes in handy.</p>
<p>You may need to zoom into videos to pay attention to details and focus on parts around the subject that others are missing out. For example, you have recorded a video, and you have played it on VLC to zoom in and ensure that there is nothing distracting before you publish the video. Now, we will illustrate all the different ways on how to zoom in VLC Media Player. We will also suggest a better alternative to zoom into videos easily.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Zoom-VLC-Video-Using-Interactive-Zoom"><a href="#Part-1-Zoom-VLC-Video-Using-Interactive-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom"></a>Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom</h2><p>VLC Media Player comes with Interactive Zoom feature that lets you zoom into a section of a video irrespective of its resolution. You can use Interactive Zoom feature to zoom nearly eight times the original size of the video. While you zoom your video with Interactive Zoom option, VLC Media Player zooms the video digitally, and if the video resolution is not high, you can see some deterioration in video quality as you zoom in. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom with Interactive Zoom.</p>
<p>Step1First, you have to enable Interactive Zoom feature. Launch VLC Player and go to Tools menu option.</p>
<p>Step2Select Effects and Filters and you will see Adjustments and Effects window open.</p>
<p>Step3Go to Video Effects tab and then go to Geometry tab.</p>
<p>Step4Turn on Interactive Zoom option. Click on Save and Close buttons.</p>

                      alt="zoom in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step5Play a video and you will see a Picture in Picture window in the top-left corner where you can see live preview of the video. You will notice a rectangular box that you can drag around the PiP window to zoom that section of the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="zoom in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step6Wherever you place the rectangular box in PiP window, that part will be zoomed and shown outside the PiP window. You can increase or decrease the level of magnification from the vertical slider present below PiP window.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Zoom-Video-Using-VLC-Video-Menu"><a href="#Part-2-Zoom-Video-Using-VLC-Video-Menu" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Zoom Video Using VLC Video Menu"></a>Part 2: Zoom Video Using VLC Video Menu</h2><p>Apart from Interactive Zoom, there is also an inbuilt Zoom option available under Video Menu. While Interactive Zoom is for detailed zooming, Zoom through Video menu on VLC is for instant zooming. Moreover, Zoom through Video menu is effective only when you view the video on VLC Player. If you are watching the video on full screen, the zooming effect will not be easily noticeable. Here are the steps on how to zoom in VLC player using VLC Video menu.</p>
<p>Step1Open VLC Media player in windowed mode and play the desired video.</p>
<p>Step2Go to Video menu and select Zoom option.</p>
<p>Step3You will come across several options such as 1:4 quarter, 1:2 half, 1:1 original, and 2:1 double. You can select from one of them as per your requirements.</p>

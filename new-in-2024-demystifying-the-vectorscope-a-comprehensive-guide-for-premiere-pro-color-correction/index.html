When two people look at the same picture, they may see different shades of colors. In post-production, Vectorscopes help to color grade and make sure you get your images exactly right. This means that you will process the exact color that you want across devices. <strong>Premiere Vectorscope</strong> is a great choice for anyone looking to correct and grade colors. Using Vectorscope Premiere allows you to get quantitative data about your image for a more accurate assessment of colors within the film. In this article, we explore what comprises Premiere Pro Vectorscope and how to use them in video editing.</p>

Vectorscope: What is It and How to Read"></a><strong>Part 1. Vectorscope: What is It and How to Read</strong></h2><p>Vectorscopes provide a great post-production way for color correction. It is video scope that provides greater data about the color properties of an image. Another way to look at it is that a Vectorscope is a circular graph, which monitors the following information of an image. By looking at it, you can measure saturation outward from the center while hue is measured in a circular pattern.</p>
<p>The Vectorscope contains markings indicating the degree of saturation and hue in an image. The distance of the markings from the center indicates how saturated the color is in your image. In simple terms, the further the markings, the more saturated the color. The two main options of Vectorscope are HLS and YUV. The HLS displays the hue, lightness, saturation, and signal information at a glance. On the other hand, the YUV mode contains several color boxes, giving accurate levels of hue and saturation.</p>

<p>Vectorscopes are useful to filmmakers and editors to ensure greater conformity in a film as they transition from one shot to the next. When the camera captures an image with too much saturation, using a Vectorscope helps to reduce the said saturation. This makes Vectorscope a useful feature for color correction and color grading. Color correction involves altering the colors of an image within a film to provide consistency and tone for the film. On the other hand, color grading is more like a supercharged version of color correction. It refers to altering a film so that it matches a tone or theme. Since the two, grading and correction are important, more video editing will use a combination of both.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Read-a-Vectorscope"><a href="#How-to-Read-a-Vectorscope" class="headerlink" title="How to Read a Vectorscope"></a><strong>How to Read a Vectorscope</strong></h3><p>Learning how to read a Vectorscope will make your video editing fun and easier. The best way is to view the Vectorscope in relation to the color wheel. When using Premiere Vectorscope, the colors are nicely labeled for anyone to understand. You only need to understand the primary colors of saturation and hue to accurately read a Vectorscope.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="reading vectorscope"
                ></p>
<p>The hue color is the direction to which the marketer points. For instance, a marker pointing toward the boxes labeled “R” indicates that the hue is predominantly red. On the other hand, the saturation correlates to the length of the marker. The image is more saturated when the marker is furthest from the center of the wheel.</p>
<p>Keep note of the two boxes in each main color. The box that is close to the center indicates 75%, and you will normally avoid the marker extending beyond this first box. Any marketer that extends beyond this is known as non-broadcast safe or illegal colors. Although you may need to go beyond the first box in some projects for stylistic reasons, the general rule of thumb is to avoid that.</p>

Reading a Vectorscope on Premiere Pro</strong></h3><p>A Vectorscope is similar to a color wheel. It displays colors in the same places as the wheel, with cyan to the bottom right and red to the top left. When you see a dot or line in the Vectorscope, you can tell it is giving you information about the color or chrominance of a shot. Essentially, this information is the hue (specific color) and the saturation (the strength of that hue).</p>

<p>As you examine the Vectorscope, you get to see how strong a particular color is by the length of the line from the center of the wheel. A longer line indicates that the color is more saturated. However, all Vectorscopes have small color targets. The Vectorscope points are lined with a drop-down used to read the scope. The default is set to 75%, which is a good limit for a typical broadcast system.</p>

Vectorscope: What is It and How to Read"></a><strong>Part 1. Vectorscope: What is It and How to Read</strong></h2><p>Vectorscopes provide a great post-production way for color correction. It is video scope that provides greater data about the color properties of an image. Another way to look at it is that a Vectorscope is a circular graph, which monitors the following information of an image. By looking at it, you can measure saturation outward from the center while hue is measured in a circular pattern.</p>
<p>The Vectorscope contains markings indicating the degree of saturation and hue in an image. The distance of the markings from the center indicates how saturated the color is in your image. In simple terms, the further the markings, the more saturated the color. The two main options of Vectorscope are HLS and YUV. The HLS displays the hue, lightness, saturation, and signal information at a glance. On the other hand, the YUV mode contains several color boxes, giving accurate levels of hue and saturation.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Vectorscopes are useful to filmmakers and editors to ensure greater conformity in a film as they transition from one shot to the next. When the camera captures an image with too much saturation, using a Vectorscope helps to reduce the said saturation. This makes Vectorscope a useful feature for color correction and color grading. Color correction involves altering the colors of an image within a film to provide consistency and tone for the film. On the other hand, color grading is more like a supercharged version of color correction. It refers to altering a film so that it matches a tone or theme. Since the two, grading and correction are important, more video editing will use a combination of both.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Read-a-Vectorscope-1"><a href="#How-to-Read-a-Vectorscope-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Read a Vectorscope"></a><strong>How to Read a Vectorscope</strong></h3><p>Learning how to read a Vectorscope will make your video editing fun and easier. The best way is to view the Vectorscope in relation to the color wheel. When using Premiere Vectorscope, the colors are nicely labeled for anyone to understand. You only need to understand the primary colors of saturation and hue to accurately read a Vectorscope.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="reading vectorscope"
                ></p>
<p>The hue color is the direction to which the marketer points. For instance, a marker pointing toward the boxes labeled “R” indicates that the hue is predominantly red. On the other hand, the saturation correlates to the length of the marker. The image is more saturated when the marker is furthest from the center of the wheel.</p>
<p>Keep note of the two boxes in each main color. The box that is close to the center indicates 75%, and you will normally avoid the marker extending beyond this first box. Any marketer that extends beyond this is known as non-broadcast safe or illegal colors. Although you may need to go beyond the first box in some projects for stylistic reasons, the general rule of thumb is to avoid that.</p>
<p>Without proper calibration, your images may end up looking too red or too blue. They will not look natural at all and will affect the overall quality of your video. Therefore, using the features within the vectorsope will help you color-grade your images to perfection.</p>

MP4: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:</p>
<h3 id="TS"><a href="#TS" class="headerlink" title="TS"></a>TS</h3><p>TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.</p>
<h3 id="MP4"><a href="#MP4" class="headerlink" title="MP4"></a>MP4</h3><p>MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the ‘.ts’ extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.</p>
<h3 id="Bottom-Line"><a href="#Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom Line"></a>Bottom Line</h3><p>The article has shared great details about the TS format. We talked about how you can play TS files on VLC and also shed light on its pros and cons. Moreover, we also shared a video editor to edit your TS file format videos.

MP4: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:</p>
<h3 id="TS-1"><a href="#TS-1" class="headerlink" title="TS"></a>TS</h3><p>TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.</p>
<h3 id="MP4-1"><a href="#MP4-1" class="headerlink" title="MP4"></a>MP4</h3><p>MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the ‘.ts’ extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.</p>
<h3 id="Bottom-Line-1"><a href="#Bottom-Line-1" class="headerlink" title="Bottom Line"></a>Bottom Line</h3><p>The article has shared great details about the TS format.

What Is TS Video Format?</h2><p>A TS format file is a Video Transport Stream file. The TS file extension is used to store video data, mostly on DVDs. The video files are standardly compressed with .MPEG video compression. If you are looking for a file extension to save streamed or broadcast videos, TS video format is ideal for this. Are you worried about how to play a TS file?</p>

Pros and Coins about TS Video Format</h2><p>Everything has its beneficial factors and disadvantages, so does TS video format has. Are you ready to know more about the TS file format? After learning about the format, it’s time to share its advantages and drawbacks with you. Let’s get started!</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-of-TS-File-Format-2"><a href="#Advantages-of-TS-File-Format-2" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of TS File Format"></a>Advantages of TS File Format</h3><p>A great thing about TS format is that, after each keyframe, the file information is added automatically. The format is impressive when it comes to maintaining transmission integrity. This is because of all the elementary streams, synchronization patterns, and error corrections; everything is encapsulated in a container format.</p>
<p>Do you know what else benefits TS format has? It is widely used for broadcasting because broadcasting doesn’t need the complete stream for playing it. You can easily share large files over the communication media in real-time as tiny chunks of the audio or video file are sent. Along with this, the error is easily detected as extra information is shared with every chunk, helping in error detection.</p>
<h3 id="Drawbacks-of-TS-File-Format-2"><a href="#Drawbacks-of-TS-File-Format-2" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks of TS File Format"></a>Drawbacks of TS File Format</h3><p>Moving on to its disadvantages, let’s start with the device compatibility. The biggest drawback of using the TS file format is that it is not compatible with many devices. For instance, a built-in media player like Windows Media Player does not support the format; eventually, users must change the file format.</p>
<p>Do you know another significant disadvantage? You cannot share TS files online. Different platforms like Facebook, YouTube, etc., support other famous formats, so hence, sharing TS video files requires a format converter. Do you know how much space does a TS file occupies? Well, it acquires a significant storage space, more than other file formats.</p>

MP4: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:</p>
<h3 id="TS-2"><a href="#TS-2" class="headerlink" title="TS"></a>TS</h3><p>TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.</p>
<h3 id="MP4-2"><a href="#MP4-2" class="headerlink" title="MP4"></a>MP4</h3><p>MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the ‘.ts’ extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.</p>

What Is TS Video Format?</h2><p>A TS format file is a Video Transport Stream file. The TS file extension is used to store video data, mostly on DVDs.

<h2 id="Part-2-Pros-and-Coins-about-TS-Video-Format-3"><a href="#Part-2-Pros-and-Coins-about-TS-Video-Format-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Pros and Coins about TS Video Format"></a>Part 2. Pros and Coins about TS Video Format</h2><p>Everything has its beneficial factors and disadvantages, so does TS video format has. Are you ready to know more about the TS file format? After learning about the format, it’s time to share its advantages and drawbacks with you. Let’s get started!</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-of-TS-File-Format-3"><a href="#Advantages-of-TS-File-Format-3" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of TS File Format"></a>Advantages of TS File Format</h3><p>A great thing about TS format is that, after each keyframe, the file information is added automatically. The format is impressive when it comes to maintaining transmission integrity. This is because of all the elementary streams, synchronization patterns, and error corrections; everything is encapsulated in a container format.</p>
<p>Do you know what else benefits TS format has? It is widely used for broadcasting because broadcasting doesn’t need the complete stream for playing it. You can easily share large files over the communication media in real-time as tiny chunks of the audio or video file are sent. Along with this, the error is easily detected as extra information is shared with every chunk, helping in error detection.</p>
<h3 id="Drawbacks-of-TS-File-Format-3"><a href="#Drawbacks-of-TS-File-Format-3" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks of TS File Format"></a>Drawbacks of TS File Format</h3><p>Moving on to its disadvantages, let’s start with the device compatibility. The biggest drawback of using the TS file format is that it is not compatible with many devices. For instance, a built-in media player like Windows Media Player does not support the format; eventually, users must change the file format.</p>
<p>Do you know another significant disadvantage? You cannot share TS files online. Different platforms like Facebook, YouTube, etc., support other famous formats, so hence, sharing TS video files requires a format converter. Do you know how much space does a TS file occupies? Well, it acquires a significant storage space, more than other file formats.</p>

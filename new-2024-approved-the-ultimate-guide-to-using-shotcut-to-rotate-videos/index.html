<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>

It allows you to merge multiple videos and edit the video content, compare videos, and create films. It is easy to use and offers all basic viewing and fixing options.</p>
<p>Follow the step-by-step guide to merge videos using Photos App on Windows 10:</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-Lauch-the-Photos-App"><a href="#Step-1-Lauch-the-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Lauch the Photos App"></a>Step 1: Lauch the Photos App</h3><p>You might wish to put all of the films or photographs you want to merge into one folder on your computer before going to the Photos app. It will aid in the speeding up of the entire procedure.</p>
<p>Type ‘Photos’ into your computer’s search bar, then click on the program that appears.</p>

<p>The second part of this procedure is known by several titles in different versions of Windows 10’s Photos app, such as creating a video with music, creating a film with text, and a new video project.</p>
<p>Launching the editor mode directly from the photo if you’re using photos in your video project is also possible. In that case, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your file in the Photos app</li>
<li>Select Edit &amp; Create</li>
<li>Select Create a movie with text from the drop-down menu.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="combine-videos-into-one"
                ></p>
<p>You can name the project by typing it in the name tab in the top left corner of your screen. Then, by clicking the pencil icon next to your project’s name, you can alter your title at any moment.</p>
<p>The video editor in the Photos app won’t allow you to upload files until you’ve given your project a title. When you try to add a file, a pop-up choice will display, and you may write in the project’s name and then click OK or Create a Video to continue.</p>
<h3 id="Step-3-Import-Files"><a href="#Step-3-Import-Files" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Import Files"></a>Step 3: Import Files</h3><p>To add files to your video project, go to the Project Library portion of your screen and click the + icon that you see in the top left corner.</p>
<p>If you have all of the files you wish to merge into one video in one folder, you can select them all and add them to your project using the ‘This PC’ option. Alternatively, you can add the files one by one.</p>
<p>The tool will automatically combine all of your files into a single video. Then, you can alter the video order in the Storyboard and edit them.</p>
<p>Go to your Project Library and drag all of the files you added to the video editor into the Storyboard section to get started on your project.</p>

<li>Using the handlebar, shorten or prolong the duration of your clip as desired.</li>
<li>Select “Done” from the drop-down menu.</li>

<p>Select the Background Music option in the top-right corner of the screen. Then, mute or adjust the volume of your video.</p>

<h3 id="Step-6-Add-Text"><a href="#Step-6-Add-Text" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Add Text"></a>Step 6: Add Text</h3><p>You can add text to your video project using the Windows video editor, but there aren’t many font styles to choose from. You’ll also have to add and optimize your text for each clip separately, which isn’t the most time-efficient approach.</p>
<p>To add text to your clips, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose Text</li>
<li>Select the small box icon on the clip you want to add text to</li>
<li>In the empty box, type the text you wish to add.</li>

This Article Will Show You How to Apply Motion Tracking Effect Into Videos</h2><p>Motion tracking makes it easier to follow the movement of objects and provide the sensed data to a program for additional processing. Motion tracking involves recording an object’s movements that match a previously stored motion template. This has a wide range of uses, including in robotics, entertainment, sports, the military, and the entertainment industry. Additionally, it is utilized in the creation of video games and films. While motion tracking is frequently referred to as match movement in the film and video game industries, motion tracking is frequently referred to as motion capture in other contexts.</p>

<h3 id="Kdenlive"><a href="#Kdenlive" class="headerlink" title="Kdenlive"></a>Kdenlive</h3><p>A motion tracker was recently added to Kdenlive, an open source and free video editing tool, under its Effects section. This program analyzes an object’s tracking information and automatically generates a map of the object’s motion. Following that, you can align a title, an image, an icon, and any other 2D elements to the moving object using this track. Motion Tracker’s regularly updated algorithms are one of its key characteristics, which leads to a higher tracking success rate and faster tracking speed.</p>

<p>Its optical flow tracking technique is outstanding. It successfully tracks a moving item that changes into multiple shapes or is veiled for a few frames by figuring out the brightness flow of the moving object. Beginners can therefore save a great deal of time and effort when designing settings to deal with complex frames.</p>
<h3 id="VEGAS-Pro"><a href="#VEGAS-Pro" class="headerlink" title="VEGAS Pro"></a>VEGAS Pro</h3><p>In VEGAS Pro 18 and later, auto motion tracking is a freshly upgraded function.

Differences between camera tracking and motion tracking?</h2><p>Making the audience forget that there is a camera in the room is one of the primary goals of filmmaking. To engage the audience, tracking shots like camera tracking and motion tracking are helpful.

<p>What distinguishes motion tracking from camera tracking? Their differences are due to how they view the course of action. From a camera’s perspective, motion tracking monitors an object’s movement. The scenario is more immersive thanks to camera tracking, which detects the movement of the camera and presents it as though you are in a virtual or augmented reality environment.</p>
<p>We’ll examine tracking’s development in the movie and its significance to the business. What it is and how it affects the cinematography industry. Along with the many software used for both motion tracking and camera tracking, we’ll also look at some of the popular applications for both.</p>
<p><strong>Motion tracking</strong></p>
<p>Motion tracking is similar to a car pursuit on the highway in an action movie. Let’s use a SimCity environment as another illustration: your Sim’s movement is monitored against the steady scene of your home. The frame is set on your Sim, regardless of what your Sim does.</p>
<p><strong>Camera tracking</strong></p>
<p>When the camera must move and the object being “tracked” must remain stationary, camera tracking might be utilized instead of motion tracking.

<p>The same basic idea underlies motion tracking and stabilization. Both follow a moving target. When stabilizing, you choose the location where you wish to remain concentrated and centered despite movement.

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In video editing, techniques like motion tracking and camera tracking are frequently employed. Even though they are frequently compared, both employ various vantage angles to depict motion. By following the moving object’s movement throughout the frame, motion tracking maintains the moving object in focus. A post-production technique called camera tracking uses data from a pre-shot movie to project a parallel virtual camera that displays a 3D perspective. If motion tracking and camera tracking have anything in common, it’s the way they draw the viewer into the tale and make them feel like a part of it. This gives your audience a sense of immersion in the story and enables your movie to linger in their minds emotionally and visually long after the credits have rolled.</p>
<p>Part 1. Learning to Understand Motion Tracking</p>
<p>We need to ask the really crucial question now that we have a fundamental understanding of what it is. What in the world am I going to do with this? In order to do that, let’s quickly review some excellent applications for motion tracking. You could,</p>
<p>Utilize tracking information to stabilize motion<br>Add text or solids as additional compositional elements<br>Add 3D elements to 2D footage<br>Use effects or color gradation methods<br>Replace the screens on your computer, mobile device, or television</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of how motion tracking might be useful. You need to be able to track motion in compositions of any complexity.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can film the video either in the vertical format of the camera or in horizontal format. It all depends upon your script!</p>
<p>Follow the below-mentioned steps to record the first footage for the video:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold the camera in a perfect format, whatever you choose.</li>
<li>Let the subject stand or sit in the middle of the frame.</li>
<li>The filmmaker can rotate the camera when the subject’s hand rotates.</li>
<li>Try your best to rotate the camera 180 degrees.</li>
<li>Ensure that the camera lens faces the ground at the end of the rotation.</li>

Follow the below steps to record it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step is to hold the camera in the same direction as the first footage.</li>
<li>When editing, make sure the subject’s position matches the first footage.</li>
<li>Make sure the subject’s hand movement is in the opposite direction from the first shot.</li>

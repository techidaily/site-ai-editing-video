But it can also be used to remove the background of an animated GIF. Here, we will discuss the step-by-step approach to removing an animated GIF background.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import The GIF File</strong></p>
<p>This can be done in 2 ways. One is clicking and dragging the file from the file location on the computer, into Photoshop. The second way is to click on the “File” menu of Photoshop. Then tap on “Open” and double click on the desired GIF file.</p>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-1.jpg"
                      alt="import file photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Set Up The Project</strong></p>
<p>It is required to edit each frame separately for deleting the background of an animated GIF (<strong>gif remove bg</strong>). For this:</p>
<p>Find the “Video Group” option on the right side of Photoshop. Right-click on it and tap on the “Ungroup layers” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-2.jpg"
                      alt="ungroup video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>This will give you the video layer, which you want to edit. Right-click on “layer 1” and tap on the “Convert to smart object” option. Again right-click on “Layer 1” and click on “Edit Contents”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-3.jpg"
                      alt="converted to so photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>You will get a new Photoshop tap for the editing of GIF files. Just freely close the original tab.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Begin The Editing Part</strong></p>
<p>Find the blue line called the Timeline at the bottom of the screen. This Timeline will help you to edit the GIF. To make your editing easy, you can zoom on the frames with the help of a slider located at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>For a better outcome, the frame-by-frame deletion of the GIF background is advisable. It might be a little time-consuming but it is the most appropriate and accurate approach. So, delete the background from each frame independently.</p>
<p>To move from one frame of the GIF to another, hold and move the blue arrow having a red line.</p>

But it can also be used to remove the background of an animated GIF. Here, we will discuss the step-by-step approach to removing an animated GIF background.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import The GIF File</strong></p>
<p>This can be done in 2 ways. One is clicking and dragging the file from the file location on the computer, into Photoshop. The second way is to click on the “File” menu of Photoshop. Then tap on “Open” and double click on the desired GIF file.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="import file photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Set Up The Project</strong></p>
<p>It is required to edit each frame separately for deleting the background of an animated GIF (<strong>gif remove bg</strong>). For this:</p>
<p>Find the “Video Group” option on the right side of Photoshop. Right-click on it and tap on the “Ungroup layers” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-2.jpg"
                      alt="ungroup video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>This will give you the video layer, which you want to edit. Right-click on “layer 1” and tap on the “Convert to smart object” option. Again right-click on “Layer 1” and click on “Edit Contents”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="converted to so photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>You will get a new Photoshop tap for the editing of GIF files. Just freely close the original tab.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Begin The Editing Part</strong></p>
<p>Find the blue line called the Timeline at the bottom of the screen. This Timeline will help you to edit the GIF. To make your editing easy, you can zoom on the frames with the help of a slider located at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>For a better outcome, the frame-by-frame deletion of the GIF background is advisable. It might be a little time-consuming but it is the most appropriate and accurate approach. So, delete the background from each frame independently.</p>
<p>To move from one frame of the GIF to another, hold and move the blue arrow having a red line.</p>

But it can also be used to remove the background of an animated GIF. Here, we will discuss the step-by-step approach to removing an animated GIF background.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import The GIF File</strong></p>
<p>This can be done in 2 ways. One is clicking and dragging the file from the file location on the computer, into Photoshop. The second way is to click on the “File” menu of Photoshop. Then tap on “Open” and double click on the desired GIF file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-1.jpg"
                      alt="import file photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Set Up The Project</strong></p>
<p>It is required to edit each frame separately for deleting the background of an animated GIF (<strong>gif remove bg</strong>). For this:</p>
<p>Find the “Video Group” option on the right side of Photoshop. Right-click on it and tap on the “Ungroup layers” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-2.jpg"
                      alt="ungroup video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>This will give you the video layer, which you want to edit. Right-click on “layer 1” and tap on the “Convert to smart object” option. Again right-click on “Layer 1” and click on “Edit Contents”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-3.jpg"
                      alt="converted to so photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>You will get a new Photoshop tap for the editing of GIF files. Just freely close the original tab.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Begin The Editing Part</strong></p>
<p>Find the blue line called the Timeline at the bottom of the screen. This Timeline will help you to edit the GIF. To make your editing easy, you can zoom on the frames with the help of a slider located at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>For a better outcome, the frame-by-frame deletion of the GIF background is advisable. It might be a little time-consuming but it is the most appropriate and accurate approach. So, delete the background from each frame independently.</p>
<p>To move from one frame of the GIF to another, hold and move the blue arrow having a red line.</p>
<p>\</p>

                      alt="move frame by frame photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Delete The Transparent GIF Background</strong></p>
<p>Now, delete the background of each frame of your GIF. To delete the background of any particular frame, click on that frame. For this, you can either use a “Quick Selection Tool” or a “Polygonal Lasso Tool”. You will get the final result that will be background free.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save The Project In GIF Format</strong></p>
<p>To save the GIF project, click on the “File” menu and then tap on the “Save As” option. Give a file name and select “GIF” on the “Save As Type” options menu. Then click on “OK” to save the GIF file.</p>

But it can also be used to remove the background of an animated GIF. Here, we will discuss the step-by-step approach to removing an animated GIF background.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import The GIF File</strong></p>
<p>This can be done in 2 ways. One is clicking and dragging the file from the file location on the computer, into Photoshop. The second way is to click on the “File” menu of Photoshop. Then tap on “Open” and double click on the desired GIF file.</p>

                      alt="import file photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Set Up The Project</strong></p>
<p>It is required to edit each frame separately for deleting the background of an animated GIF (<strong>gif remove bg</strong>). For this:</p>
<p>Find the “Video Group” option on the right side of Photoshop. Right-click on it and tap on the “Ungroup layers” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-2.jpg"
                      alt="ungroup video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>This will give you the video layer, which you want to edit. Right-click on “layer 1” and tap on the “Convert to smart object” option. Again right-click on “Layer 1” and click on “Edit Contents”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="converted to so photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>You will get a new Photoshop tap for the editing of GIF files. Just freely close the original tab.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Begin The Editing Part</strong></p>
<p>Find the blue line called the Timeline at the bottom of the screen. This Timeline will help you to edit the GIF. To make your editing easy, you can zoom on the frames with the help of a slider located at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>For a better outcome, the frame-by-frame deletion of the GIF background is advisable. It might be a little time-consuming but it is the most appropriate and accurate approach. So, delete the background from each frame independently.</p>
<p>To move from one frame of the GIF to another, hold and move the blue arrow having a red line.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Delete The Transparent GIF Background</strong></p>
<p>Now, delete the background of each frame of your GIF. To delete the background of any particular frame, click on that frame. For this, you can either use a “Quick Selection Tool” or a “Polygonal Lasso Tool”. You will get the final result that will be background free.</p>

<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac.

<p><strong>Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid Instagram Video Cutter?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How do you post long videos on Instagram without splitting?</strong> Instagram allows users to post long videos on the app, as long as 60 seconds. Alternatively, you can use the IGTV to upload long clips on Instagram without splitting.</li>
<li><strong>What is multi-capture on Instagram:</strong> This tool allows you to create and share multiple photos on your stories.</li>
<li><strong>How do I split the video into two parts for Instagram on Mac?</strong> The paid and free video cutters shared above will help you split a video into two parts for Instagram on Mac. Simply pick the option that fits your preference.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video. When deciding which is the best option for you, free or paid, the factors listed will help you decide. Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video.

Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid Instagram Video Cutter?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How do you post long videos on Instagram without splitting?</strong> Instagram allows users to post long videos on the app, as long as 60 seconds. Alternatively, you can use the IGTV to upload long clips on Instagram without splitting.</li>
<li><strong>What is multi-capture on Instagram:</strong> This tool allows you to create and share multiple photos on your stories.</li>
<li><strong>How do I split the video into two parts for Instagram on Mac?</strong> The paid and free video cutters shared above will help you split a video into two parts for Instagram on Mac. Simply pick the option that fits your preference.</li>
<li><strong>Why can’t I split a video on iMovie?</strong> Maybe your iMovie software is experiencing a glitch; you can simply restart the software. Alternately, move the clip to the center row if you find the option greyed out. Moving the clip should help fix the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video. When deciding which is the best option for you, free or paid, the factors listed will help you decide. Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

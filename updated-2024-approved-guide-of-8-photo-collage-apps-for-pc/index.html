Well, the main benefit is that you can get something fun and interest out of it, of course.</p>
<p>And, unlike with traditional collages — which are messy and require lots of prep-work and glue — you can go create pic collages with a <strong>photo collage app for PC</strong> relatively easily. All you have to do most of the time is to choose a layout that you like and then fill it with the photographs, videos, GIFs, etc. that you want. Most programs also give you the choice to add things like text (for making the collage more meaningful), stickers, frames, and so on, so that you can fully deck out your photo collages exactly how you want to.</p>

<h2 id="Best-8-Animated-Video-Makers"><a href="#Best-8-Animated-Video-Makers" class="headerlink" title="Best 8 Animated Video Makers"></a>Best 8 Animated Video Makers</h2><p>Animations can be a great way to get your work to stand out and the best animated video maker can help you get this effect very easily. Here, we will be helping you find the best way to create animated videos for your particular project.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that there are very many animation programs in the market and choosing the best one will depend on your needs, your style, the feature and tools you need, the cost of the program, and even the export options that each tool gives you.</p>
<p>Before we look at the best ways to create animated videos, let’s start by examining why you would need to use an animated video maker in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="When-to-Use-an-Animated-Video-Maker"><a href="#When-to-Use-an-Animated-Video-Maker" class="headerlink" title="When to Use an Animated Video Maker"></a>When to Use an Animated Video Maker</h2><p>There are several reasons why you would want to create an animated video, rather than use traditional video solutions. The following are the most important from a digital marketing standpoint;</p>
<p><strong>Improve Conversion and Sales</strong></p>
<p>Animated videos are engaging enough to improve your conversion and sales. Studies have shown that an animated video can increase both conversion and sales by up to 80%. It may therefore be a good idea to use an animated explainer video to show your potential customers how to purchase a product or service on your website.</p>
<p><strong>Increase Brand Awareness</strong></p>
<p>Because they can be very entertaining and engaging, animated videos can also be a great way to increase brand awareness. And since they can be created very easily and cheaply, they can be a good way to reach potential customers.</p>
<p><strong>Generate Online Leads</strong></p>
<p>Because of the engaging nature of animated videos, you can use them to introduce yourself to potential customers and generate online leads. They have a very high conversion rate, as we have seen before, making them one of the best ways to reach people who would otherwise have never heard of you and your brand.</p>
<p><strong>Explain Complex Processes</strong></p>
<p>It can be very difficult to try to explain very complex ideas such as the mechanical aspect of a certain tool using words. But a well-crafted animated video gives you the chance to explain complex ideas in a fun and engaging way, making it easier for your customers to understand and engage with your brand.</p>

By applying any of the following methods, you can easily focus on the small details.</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Zoom-In-and-Out-on-the-YouTube-Video-Player-3"><a href="#Method-1-Zoom-In-and-Out-on-the-YouTube-Video-Player-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Zoom In and Out on the YouTube Video Player"></a>Method 1: Zoom In and Out on the YouTube Video Player</h3><p>Are you looking for easier ways to zoom in and out of the YouTube video? YouTube gives the option on its player for viewing the videos in two modes: Theatre mode and full mode. Through theater mode, you can watch your video in a comparatively zoomed manner, whereas, in full screen, you can watch the video on a full screen of the monitor.</p>
<p>In this particular method, we will provide simple and easy steps for zooming in on the YouTube video player:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Navigate to the YouTube app on your device browser, such as Google Chrome. On its search box, enter the video you want to watch.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-and-out-youtube-1.jpg"
                      alt="search for youtube video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press Enter, and you will see various options related to your desired video. Click on any particular video to watch.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-and-out-youtube-2.jpg"
                      alt="select your video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> On the YouTube video player, you would be able to see two screen mode options on the right side. The first option is “Full Screen” mode, through which you can enjoy watching your videos on a full monitor screen. The second option is “Theatre Mode,” which will display the video in a cinematic look by zooming in to some extent. Explore these options to observe the small details in your YouTube video closely.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-and-out-youtube-3.jpg"
                      alt="use youtube player modes"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-2-Zoom-In-and-Out-with-Browser-Zoom-Features-3"><a href="#Method-2-Zoom-In-and-Out-with-Browser-Zoom-Features-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Zoom In and Out with Browser Zoom Features"></a>Method 2: Zoom In and Out with Browser Zoom Features</h3><p>To <strong>zoom</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>on</strong> <strong>YouTube</strong> <strong>videos</strong>, your browser also offers effective ways for the users. By using the browser zoom features, you can quickly zoom in and out of the video without the need for additional help. Moreover, these zoom features are also beneficial for reading eBooks or online documents.</p>
<p>Here are the three ways through which you can instantly zoom in on your favorite YouTube videos easily:</p>
<p><strong>Way 1:</strong> The first way to zoom in on video is through browser options. To do so, tap on the “Three-Dot” icon of your browser displayed in the top right corner. From the menu, tap on “Zoom” and control the actions through its small menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-and-out-youtube-4.jpg"
                      alt="use chrome zoom from menu"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Way 2:</strong> Another way to zoom in and out of the YouTube video is through your mouse pad. Point your cursor to the place where you want to zoom and try to expand the screen from your mouse pad and vice versa for zoom out.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-and-out-youtube-5.jpg"
                      alt="use your laptop touchpad"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Way 3:</strong> On the URL search bar of YouTube, you can see different icons displayed next to it. Simply tap on the “Zoom” icon to control the zoom in and out accordingly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-and-out-youtube-6.jpg"
                      alt="tap on zoom icon"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-3-Zoom-In-on-YouTube-Video-with-Browser-Extension-3"><a href="#Method-3-Zoom-In-on-YouTube-Video-with-Browser-Extension-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Zoom In on YouTube Video with Browser Extension"></a>Method 3: Zoom In on YouTube Video with Browser Extension</h3><p>In this section, we will use a browser extension that will assist you in zooming in and out on YouTube videos comfortably.

Through its slider, you can zoom in on the YouTube video up to 400 factors with a single swipe.</p>
<p>Moreover, through this special browser extension, you can save the zoomed version of the website and can resume watching the videos from the set zoom value.

<p><img

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-and-out-youtube-7.jpg"
                      alt="add zoom extension to chrome"

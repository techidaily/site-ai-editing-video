<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>

<p>6. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software.

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder.

<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive.

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

But you don’t have to worry about it anymore let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>What are you planning to use it for?</strong>: You must know the use of video editing software before picking one. Whether you are using it for gaming or creating ordinary YouTube videos. These decisions are very important to take before opting for downloading it from the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Learning curve</strong>: You should keep in mind which editing software is complex to learn and which one is easy in comparison with that. If you didn’t keep this in mind you might end up wasting your time by downloading and trying in vain.</p>
<p><strong>Quality</strong>: Another important factor to consider in video editing software is the quality and format of the video. There are many formats and quality of video content, therefore it is important to choose the one which supports your video format.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong>: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor that should have all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.</p>
<p><strong>Compatability</strong>: The most important point is whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you have heard the name from your friend. Consult the internet for compatibility of the software by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.</p>

<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) is free and open-source software that allows users to record videos and live stream events right at their comfort. The software functions effectively on Mac, Windows, and Linux computers.</p>
<p>Since its initial launch in 2012, OBS has made tremendous moves – This is not only from the constant release of its new versions but also the relentless increase in the functionality features. Besides, OBS is equipped with a robust API that enables plugins and scripts which provide extensive customization to precisely suit one’s needs.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Apply-Color-Correction-in-OBS-2"><a href="#How-to-Apply-Color-Correction-in-OBS-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Apply Color Correction in OBS"></a>How to Apply Color Correction in OBS</h2><p>When you carry out basic edits to your videos or images with OBS and realize that your project has poor shade, color, or tone, you don’t have to export it to another software to correct it. Instead, you can use filters for color correction in OBS.</p>
<p>Apart from using OBS filters to color correct video clips and images, you can correct games, browser sources, and video capture devices.</p>
<p>There are various aspects of color correction in OBS. It includes:</p>
<h4 id="1-Gamma-2"><a href="#1-Gamma-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Gamma"></a>1. Gamma</h4><p>Gamma is a fundamental aspect in OBS that functions by balancing the brightness of an image through contrast.

<p>High Gamma is represented by “L,” whereas low Gamm is represented by “R.”</p>
<h4 id="2-Contrast-2"><a href="#2-Contrast-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Contrast"></a>2. Contrast</h4><p>Contrast is the difference in the degree of colors and tones in an image. Usually, the low contrast image has a narrow color range, whereas the high contrast images have dark shadows and bright highlights.</p>
<p>“L” represents high contrast in OBS contrast, whereas “R” represents low contrast.</p>
<h4 id="3-Brightness-2"><a href="#3-Brightness-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Brightness"></a>3. Brightness</h4><p>Brightness is the degree to how light or dark a picture is. To be able to understand an image clearly, it is best to correct its brightness. A change in brightness of a picture has a simultaneous change in pixels of that image.</p>
<p>High brightness in OBS is denounced by the letter “L,” whereas Low brightness is denounced by “R.”</p>
<h4 id="4-Saturation-2"><a href="#4-Saturation-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Saturation"></a>4. Saturation</h4><p>Saturation is the intensity of colors in a video or an image.

<h2 id="What-is-OBS-3"><a href="#What-is-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="What is OBS?"></a>What is OBS?</h2><p>Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) is free and open-source software that allows users to record videos and live stream events right at their comfort. The software functions effectively on Mac, Windows, and Linux computers.</p>
<p>Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) is free and open-source software that allows users to record videos and live stream events right at their comfort. The software functions effectively on Mac, Windows, and Linux computers.</p>
<p>Since its initial launch in 2012, OBS has made tremendous moves – This is not only from the constant release of its new versions but also the relentless increase in the functionality features. Besides, OBS is equipped with a robust API that enables plugins and scripts which provide extensive customization to precisely suit one’s needs.</p>
<p>However, OBS being a free application can function to date due to enough support from sponsors and backers.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Apply-Color-Correction-in-OBS-3"><a href="#How-to-Apply-Color-Correction-in-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Apply Color Correction in OBS"></a>How to Apply Color Correction in OBS</h2><p>When you carry out basic edits to your videos or images with OBS and realize that your project has poor shade, color, or tone, you don’t have to export it to another software to correct it. Instead, you can use filters for color correction in OBS.</p>
<p>Apart from using OBS filters to color correct video clips and images, you can correct games, browser sources, and video capture devices.</p>
<p>There are various aspects of color correction in OBS. It includes:</p>
<h4 id="1-Gamma-3"><a href="#1-Gamma-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Gamma"></a>1. Gamma</h4><p>Gamma is a fundamental aspect in OBS that functions by balancing the brightness of an image through contrast. To be precise, Gamma works almost similarly to change in brightness while simultaneously increasing or decreasing the contrast.</p>
<p>In editing, Gamma is applicable mainly for removing shiny foreheads and webcam footage in gaming and browsing.</p>
<p>High Gamma is represented by “L,” whereas low Gamm is represented by “R.”</p>
<h4 id="2-Contrast-3"><a href="#2-Contrast-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Contrast"></a>2. Contrast</h4><p>Contrast is the difference in the degree of colors and tones in an image. Usually, the low contrast image has a narrow color range, whereas the high contrast images have dark shadows and bright highlights.</p>
<p>“L” represents high contrast in OBS contrast, whereas “R” represents low contrast.</p>
<h4 id="3-Brightness-3"><a href="#3-Brightness-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Brightness"></a>3. Brightness</h4><p>Brightness is the degree to how light or dark a picture is. To be able to understand an image clearly, it is best to correct its brightness. A change in brightness of a picture has a simultaneous change in pixels of that image.</p>
<p>High brightness in OBS is denounced by the letter “L,” whereas Low brightness is denounced by “R.”</p>
<h4 id="4-Saturation-3"><a href="#4-Saturation-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Saturation"></a>4. Saturation</h4><p>Saturation is the intensity of colors in a video or an image. High saturated images are bright, strong, and are rich, whereas the low saturated photos appear washed out. Black and white (grayscale) photos have no color saturation. In OBS, high saturation and low saturation are represented as “L” and “R.”</p>
<h4 id="5-Hue-Shift-3"><a href="#5-Hue-Shift-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Hue Shift"></a>5. Hue Shift</h4><p>Hue shift is the change in an image’s saturation, lightness, and hue colors. Hue shifting occurs when highlighting or shading images. In OBS, you can use the hue shift functionality to reimage your image with a completely different color palette.</p>
<p>With the hue shift functionality in OBS, you can place the image on top of another and have an 80% opacity. It means that you will still see the first image when you place the second one on top of it.</p>
<p>The “L” sign in the OBS hue shift represents 50% opacity, while the “R” represents 100% Opacity.</p>
<h2 id="Color-Grade-in-OBS-3"><a href="#Color-Grade-in-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="Color Grade in OBS"></a>Color Grade in OBS</h2><p>Color grading is the process of enhancing the appearance of an image through attributes such as contrast, saturation, and color, making them enchanting for presentations. Color grading is not only done for still images but also for motion pictures and images.</p>
<p>Color grading functionality in OBS is encompassed with several tools – This includes:</p>
<h4 id="1-Lift-tool-3"><a href="#1-Lift-tool-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Lift tool"></a>1. Lift tool</h4><p>As the name suggests, lift tools are used in lifting or removing specific colors from an image. It does so without necessarily affecting other colors in an image.</p>
<p>With this tool, you can selectively remove unwanted colors from your image or video, replace them with your desired ones, and create astonishing results.</p>
<h4 id="2-Offset-3"><a href="#2-Offset-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Offset"></a>2. Offset</h4><p>Offset is another outstanding tool in OBS color grading that controls the blacks&#x2F;Shadows of an image. It functions by altering the brightness levels and leaving the highlights and the mid-tones unaffected.</p>
<h4 id="3-Gain-3"><a href="#3-Gain-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Gain"></a>3. Gain</h4><p>A gain is a tool in OBS color correction that functions by only adjusting the white levels in an image. With the gain tool, brighter colors become brighter or darker.</p>
<p>Many people, especially beginner editors, experience difficulty differentiating between the Gamma and Offset tools. Yes, there is a closer similarity between the two, and for you to be on the safe side, you need to know that Gamma goes with the mid-tones (middle gray levels) whereas the Gain goes with highlights&#x2F;whites.</p>

<h3 id="Why-Filmora-is-Better-Than-GoPro-Quik"><a href="#Why-Filmora-is-Better-Than-GoPro-Quik" class="headerlink" title="Why Filmora is Better Than GoPro Quik?"></a>Why Filmora is Better Than GoPro Quik?</h3><p>Filmora provides many features that GoPro Quik does not offer. Everyone needs solid arguments and valid reasons to reconsider their choices. Thus, here we have highlighted some proven and logical reasons to use Filmora instead of GoPro:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first and foremost thing you can see is Filmora’s intuitive interface. Anyone without any video editing background can use this tool effectively for their projects.</li>
<li>Video editors need assistance while editing perfect shots. Filmora offers an <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >AI Copilot Editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> system as your editing assistant, which GoPro does not provide.

<ul>
<li>GoPro Quik allows you to edit up to 1-minute videos. In contrast, Filmora doesn’t restrict you from editing videos of a certain length.</li>
<li>With Filmora AI, you can generate a customized script and turn it into a video. AI integration for unique content makes this tool better than GoPro Quik.</li>
<li>Unlike GoPro Quik, getting personalized music tracks is possible with Filmora. It can create soundtracks that align with your project’s needs.</li>
<li><strong>Slow-motion GoPro</strong> can assist in speed-ramping videos for a smooth transition. Conversely, Filmora also offers an optical flow option to automate the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >speed ramping <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>
<li>Even GoPro Quik cannot remove vocals from the audio files. Using Filmora, this option is just a click away. It can automatically separate vocals from music tracks so you can dub high-quality videos.</li>
<li>Using GoPro, users can share their videos on social media or export them anywhere. In comparison, Filmora allows you to adjust resolution, quality, project name, and destination.</li>
<li>AI in Filmora can generate images with your prompts that will not claim legal rights. This service is unavailable in GoPro; it is just limited to video editing.</li>
<li>Last but not least, Filmora can transform your text into engaging videos. By doing so, you can save the budget for actors, video editors, and other crew.</li>

Thus, video editors seek a reliable platform like <strong>GoPro Hero 11,</strong> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>which is slow motion</strong></a>. Unfortunately, this editing app is outdated, and other better platforms are being developed. In search of the latest and easy-to-use video editor, use <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>It is a video editing software with various powerful editing features compared with GoPro Quik. This platform can perform more tasks than trimming, merging, and splitting clips. Filmora is equipped with AI technology to provide maximum ease to users. You can use this tool to ensure a smooth workflow and boost your productivity.</p>
<h3 id="Why-Filmora-is-Better-Than-GoPro-Quik-1"><a href="#Why-Filmora-is-Better-Than-GoPro-Quik-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Filmora is Better Than GoPro Quik?"></a>Why Filmora is Better Than GoPro Quik?</h3><p>Filmora provides many features that GoPro Quik does not offer. Everyone needs solid arguments and valid reasons to reconsider their choices. Thus, here we have highlighted some proven and logical reasons to use Filmora instead of GoPro:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first and foremost thing you can see is Filmora’s intuitive interface. Anyone without any video editing background can use this tool effectively for their projects.</li>
<li>Video editors need assistance while editing perfect shots. Filmora offers an <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >AI Copilot Editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> system as your editing assistant, which GoPro does not provide. It directs users to create high-quality videos.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<ul>
<li>GoPro Quik allows you to edit up to 1-minute videos. In contrast, Filmora doesn’t restrict you from editing videos of a certain length.</li>
<li>With Filmora AI, you can generate a customized script and turn it into a video. AI integration for unique content makes this tool better than GoPro Quik.</li>
<li>Unlike GoPro Quik, getting personalized music tracks is possible with Filmora. It can create soundtracks that align with your project’s needs.</li>
<li><strong>Slow-motion GoPro</strong> can assist in speed-ramping videos for a smooth transition. Conversely, Filmora also offers an optical flow option to automate the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >speed ramping <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>
<li>Even GoPro Quik cannot remove vocals from the audio files. Using Filmora, this option is just a click away. It can automatically separate vocals from music tracks so you can dub high-quality videos.</li>
<li>Using GoPro, users can share their videos on social media or export them anywhere. In comparison, Filmora allows you to adjust resolution, quality, project name, and destination.</li>
<li>AI in Filmora can generate images with your prompts that will not claim legal rights. This service is unavailable in GoPro; it is just limited to video editing.</li>
<li>Last but not least, Filmora can transform your text into engaging videos. By doing so, you can save the budget for actors, video editors, and other crew.</li>
</ul>

            <h2 id="Best-Audio-Waveform-Generator"><a href="#Best-Audio-Waveform-Generator" class="headerlink" title="Best Audio Waveform Generator"></a>Best Audio Waveform Generator</h2><p>For more than a century, sound waves and broadcasts have played an important role in shaping media as we know it. Here’s how to implement them into your social media strategy. They have become popular in short video animations used to promote audio on social media, commonly referred to as audiograms.</p>
<p>Before learning everything there is to know about audiograms and how to make them, let’s gain a better understanding of the significance of these patterns.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-an-audio-waveform"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-an-audio-waveform" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is an audio waveform?"></a>Part 1. What is an audio waveform?</h2><p>A sound wave is the vibration of air molecules, which is how sound travels. The waveform describes the wave using a graph of how the air molecule is displaced over time.</p>
<p>Amplitude is the strength of a wave’s action; the higher the amplitude, the more the air molecules are displaced. This also translates into loudness for the human ear; increasing the amplitude of the wave will increase how loud it appears to us. Sine, triangle, square, and sawtooth waveforms are the most typical periodic waveforms.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-audio-wave-animation"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-audio-wave-animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What is audio wave animation?"></a>Part 2. What is audio wave animation?</h2><p>A waveform animation video is a short video clip that can be uploaded to social media that combines an audio file with a static background image and a straightforward waveform animation. Audio animations, an example of audio visualization, make for fantastic video content, which is increasingly valuable on ever-noisy social media platforms.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Why-do-we-use-audio-visualization"><a href="#Part-3-Why-do-we-use-audio-visualization" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Why do we use audio visualization?"></a>Part 3. Why do we use audio visualization?</h2><p>We all know that there is a special way of feeling called synesthesia, which is both a psychological and a linguistic phenomenon. Similar to how you automatically link this rain scene with the sound of heavy rain when you see it. People’s newly awakened senses are more about the synthesis of sensory experience with actual life experience than they are entirely about actual information. Therefore, for clean audio, enhancing it with complementary visual animation effects will improve the user’s visual experience and, to some extent, offer additional information and impact to your audio.</p>

Best Audio Waveform Generator</h2><p>Audio visualization can be presented in a variety of ways. The simplest kind of processing involves taking low-dimensional information like frequency, loudness, and rhythm and converting them into images in the form of colors, forms, strokes, etc. However, modern artificial intelligence technology can now extract high-dimensional visual attributes including style, tone, and emotion. But, for most non-technical players, such processes are obviously out of their league, therefore your best choice is to use a basic audio waveform generator. Following, we’ll suggest 10 desktop or online generators so you may quickly finish the audio visualization project and create your audio-related videos.</p>

<ul>
<li>Once you do this, you can advance to recording the clips you want.</li>
<li>Click the timer button at the top of the screen to choose how long you would like to shoot your video; you can select 5 seconds, 10 seconds, etc.</li>

<li>After adjusting, hit the ‘done’ button and have your combined video.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can go ahead and share with your followers and the general public.</p>
<p><strong>Use the Combining Function</strong></p>
<p>The second practical way you can combine TikTok videos into a single video is by using the app’s built-in combining function. To find out how you can use this technique for your videos, follow the steps outlined below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once you have the TikTok app on your device, open it and go to the menu bar. Select the ‘+’ button; it should be at the end of the screen.</li>
<li>Instead of recording through the TikTok camera, choose the ‘upload’ button, and it will take you to your device storage, where you can select the videos you would like to upload on TikTok.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="combile-tiktok-videos-"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, choose the ‘select multiple’ option at the left corner of your screen. Once you select this option, you can select different videos you would like to join together. Once you are satisfied with your choice, hit the ‘next’ button.</li>
<li>TikTok will allow you to combine the videos for up to 60 seconds. You can customize the video arrangement according to your preference.</li>
<li>If you’re satisfied with the final video result, click the next option, and you can share it on your TikTok account.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p><strong>How to Combine Draft Videos on TikTok</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know how to combine videos on TikTok, you’re probably wondering about the best way to combine the drafts you saved on your TikTok account. Maybe when you made the videos, you were unmotivated to upload them. However, now you want to combine the videos into a single video and don’t know how to proceed. So, follow the steps outlined in this article to get it done.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Go to Your Drafts</strong></p>
<p>To begin, you have to launch the TikTok app and click on the ‘me’ option at the end of the screen. Then, it will redirect you to your profile, choose the ‘drafts’ category, and take you to the videos you saved on the app and never published.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Update Privacy Settings</strong></p>
<p>Now you want to change the privacy setting in the ‘who can watch this video’ category to ‘just me.’ After updating, tap on ‘post.’ After posting your video, you can change the setting by clicking on ‘change cut.’ You can reduce the video length and add new videos to combine TikTok drafts.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Filters and More Effects</strong></p>
<p>You can also add music to your newly combined video and texts, stickers, filters, and many more effects to enhance your video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save Draft</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="combile-tiktok-videos-"
                ></p>

<h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Bokeh-Effect"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Bokeh-Effect" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Bokeh Effect"></a>How to Create a Bokeh Effect</h2><p>There’s a strong chance you’ve heard about bokeh before if you frequently visit photography websites or have friends who are photographers. What exactly is this optical effect that camera aficionados frequently discuss? Bokeh, who is derived from the Japanese word for “blur,” is a term used in photography to describe how a lens presents an out-of-focus background.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Bokeh-Effect"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Bokeh-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is a Bokeh Effect?"></a>Part 1. What is a Bokeh Effect?</h2><p>The Japanese word boke, which meaning “blur,” “haze,” or “boke-aji,” the “blur quality,” is where the term “bokeh” originates. The pronunciation of bokeh is BOH-K or BOH-kay. You can find a lot of people discussing the beautiful bokeh that their favorite fast lenses allow on any photography website or forum.</p>
<p>Bokeh is characterized by the words “smooth,” “amazing,” “superb,” “good,” “beautiful,” “sweet,” “silky,” and “great.” But what is it exactly? When using a fast lens and the widest aperture possible, such as f&#x2F;2.8 or wider, you can create bokeh, which is described as “the effect of a fuzzy out-of-focus background.” Bokeh is the appealing or aesthetically pleasant aspect of out-of-focus blur in a shot, to put it simply.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-a-Bokeh-effect-used-for"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-a-Bokeh-effect-used-for" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What is a Bokeh effect used for?"></a>Part 2. What is a Bokeh effect used for?</h2><p>Most often, bokeh is employed for artistic purposes. You might occasionally desire a little background blur so that the viewer’s attention is drawn to the subject. In other cases, you can want it to completely detract from the subject, as in portraiture when you want to concentrate on the individual’s eyes or mouth while blurring the rest of the image. It’s true that some people use bokeh inadvertently, like looking for photos with excellent bokeh that they may use as free images on their websites or blogs. This isn’t advised, though, as it’s against the law and usually frowned upon in the photographic community as a whole to steal someone else’s image in this manner.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-do-you-create-a-Bokeh-effect"><a href="#Part-3-How-do-you-create-a-Bokeh-effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How do you create a Bokeh effect?"></a>Part 3. How do you create a Bokeh effect?</h2><p>Bokeh’s smooth, organic texture is among its most lovely features. The major goal in producing this effect is to distinguish the subject from the backdrop by employing a shallow depth of field. You will learn how to create beautiful bokeh for your photos in this video. One of the most alluring photographic effects, particularly for portraits, is bokeh. It can impart a sense of perfection to everything in a photo, making it look lot more appealing and engaging. Bokeh helps to create a dreamy backdrop that gives the image a whole new level of depth and perspective.</p>
<p>Using a camera lens with a shallow depth of focus is one of the many methods for achieving bokeh in photography. You need a short depth of field so that your lens aperture can be opened up as wide as possible to achieve beautiful bokeh. You can take pictures with shallow depth of field, often known as bokeh, with a point and shoot or a DSLR. A common photography technique used to make the subject stand out from the backdrop is called bokeh.</p>
<p>It can be used to draw attention to the topic by blurring or losing focus on the background. Three different kinds of lenses can create beautiful bokeh: prime lenses with a wide aperture The best lenses for bokeh are often wide-aperture prime lenses. Although they are frequently more expensive and heavier than zoom lenses, they offer a wider field of view. Since there is a greater difference in depth between the foreground and background when using a wide-open aperture, wide aperture prime lenses make blurring the background easier.</p>

<p>Part 1. What is a Bokeh Effect?</p>
<p>The Japanese word boke, which meaning “blur,” “haze,” or “boke-aji,” the “blur quality,” is where the term “bokeh” originates. The pronunciation of bokeh is BOH-K or BOH-kay. You can find a lot of people discussing the beautiful bokeh that their favorite fast lenses allow on any photography website or forum.</p>
<p>Bokeh is characterized by the words “smooth,” “amazing,” “superb,” “good,” “beautiful,” “sweet,” “silky,” and “great.” But what is it exactly? When using a fast lens and the widest aperture possible, such as f&#x2F;2.8 or wider, you can create bokeh, which is described as “the effect of a fuzzy out-of-focus background.” Bokeh is the appealing or aesthetically pleasant aspect of out-of-focus blur in a shot, to put it simply.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-a-Bokeh-effect-used-for-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-a-Bokeh-effect-used-for-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What is a Bokeh effect used for?"></a>Part 2. What is a Bokeh effect used for?</h2><p>Most often, bokeh is employed for artistic purposes. You might occasionally desire a little background blur so that the viewer’s attention is drawn to the subject. In other cases, you can want it to completely detract from the subject, as in portraiture when you want to concentrate on the individual’s eyes or mouth while blurring the rest of the image. It’s true that some people use bokeh inadvertently, like looking for photos with excellent bokeh that they may use as free images on their websites or blogs. This isn’t advised, though, as it’s against the law and usually frowned upon in the photographic community as a whole to steal someone else’s image in this manner.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-do-you-create-a-Bokeh-effect-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-do-you-create-a-Bokeh-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How do you create a Bokeh effect?"></a>Part 3. How do you create a Bokeh effect?</h2><p>Bokeh’s smooth, organic texture is among its most lovely features. The major goal in producing this effect is to distinguish the subject from the backdrop by employing a shallow depth of field. You will learn how to create beautiful bokeh for your photos in this video. One of the most alluring photographic effects, particularly for portraits, is bokeh. It can impart a sense of perfection to everything in a photo, making it look lot more appealing and engaging. Bokeh helps to create a dreamy backdrop that gives the image a whole new level of depth and perspective.</p>
<p>Using a camera lens with a shallow depth of focus is one of the many methods for achieving bokeh in photography. You need a short depth of field so that your lens aperture can be opened up as wide as possible to achieve beautiful bokeh. You can take pictures with shallow depth of field, often known as bokeh, with a point and shoot or a DSLR. A common photography technique used to make the subject stand out from the backdrop is called bokeh.</p>
<p>It can be used to draw attention to the topic by blurring or losing focus on the background. Three different kinds of lenses can create beautiful bokeh: prime lenses with a wide aperture The best lenses for bokeh are often wide-aperture prime lenses. Although they are frequently more expensive and heavier than zoom lenses, they offer a wider field of view. Since there is a greater difference in depth between the foreground and background when using a wide-open aperture, wide aperture prime lenses make blurring the background easier.</p>

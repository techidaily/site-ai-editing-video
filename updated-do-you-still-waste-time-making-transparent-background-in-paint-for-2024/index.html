<p>Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) is free and open-source software that allows users to record videos and live stream events right at their comfort. The software functions effectively on Mac, Windows, and Linux computers.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Apply-Color-Correction-in-OBS"><a href="#How-to-Apply-Color-Correction-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="How to Apply Color Correction in OBS"></a>How to Apply Color Correction in OBS</h2><p>When you carry out basic edits to your videos or images with OBS and realize that your project has poor shade, color, or tone, you don’t have to export it to another software to correct it. Instead, you can use filters for color correction in OBS.</p>
<p>Apart from using OBS filters to color correct video clips and images, you can correct games, browser sources, and video capture devices.</p>
<p>There are various aspects of color correction in OBS. It includes:</p>
<h4 id="1-Gamma"><a href="#1-Gamma" class="headerlink" title="1. Gamma"></a>1. Gamma</h4><p>Gamma is a fundamental aspect in OBS that functions by balancing the brightness of an image through contrast. To be precise, Gamma works almost similarly to change in brightness while simultaneously increasing or decreasing the contrast.</p>
<p>In editing, Gamma is applicable mainly for removing shiny foreheads and webcam footage in gaming and browsing.</p>
<p>High Gamma is represented by “L,” whereas low Gamm is represented by “R.”</p>
<h4 id="2-Contrast"><a href="#2-Contrast" class="headerlink" title="2. Contrast"></a>2. Contrast</h4><p>Contrast is the difference in the degree of colors and tones in an image. Usually, the low contrast image has a narrow color range, whereas the high contrast images have dark shadows and bright highlights.</p>
<p>“L” represents high contrast in OBS contrast, whereas “R” represents low contrast.</p>
<h4 id="3-Brightness"><a href="#3-Brightness" class="headerlink" title="3. Brightness"></a>3. Brightness</h4><p>Brightness is the degree to how light or dark a picture is. To be able to understand an image clearly, it is best to correct its brightness. A change in brightness of a picture has a simultaneous change in pixels of that image.</p>
<p>High brightness in OBS is denounced by the letter “L,” whereas Low brightness is denounced by “R.”</p>
<h4 id="4-Saturation"><a href="#4-Saturation" class="headerlink" title="4. Saturation"></a>4. Saturation</h4><p>Saturation is the intensity of colors in a video or an image. High saturated images are bright, strong, and are rich, whereas the low saturated photos appear washed out. Black and white (grayscale) photos have no color saturation. In OBS, high saturation and low saturation are represented as “L” and “R.”</p>
<h4 id="5-Hue-Shift"><a href="#5-Hue-Shift" class="headerlink" title="5. Hue Shift"></a>5. Hue Shift</h4><p>Hue shift is the change in an image’s saturation, lightness, and hue colors. Hue shifting occurs when highlighting or shading images. In OBS, you can use the hue shift functionality to reimage your image with a completely different color palette.</p>
<p>With the hue shift functionality in OBS, you can place the image on top of another and have an 80% opacity. It means that you will still see the first image when you place the second one on top of it.</p>
<p>The “L” sign in the OBS hue shift represents 50% opacity, while the “R” represents 100% Opacity.</p>
<h2 id="Color-Grade-in-OBS"><a href="#Color-Grade-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Color Grade in OBS"></a>Color Grade in OBS</h2><p>Color grading is the process of enhancing the appearance of an image through attributes such as contrast, saturation, and color, making them enchanting for presentations. Color grading is not only done for still images but also for motion pictures and images.</p>
<p>Color grading functionality in OBS is encompassed with several tools – This includes:</p>
<h4 id="1-Lift-tool"><a href="#1-Lift-tool" class="headerlink" title="1. Lift tool"></a>1. Lift tool</h4><p>As the name suggests, lift tools are used in lifting or removing specific colors from an image. It does so without necessarily affecting other colors in an image.</p>
<p>With this tool, you can selectively remove unwanted colors from your image or video, replace them with your desired ones, and create astonishing results.</p>
<h4 id="2-Offset"><a href="#2-Offset" class="headerlink" title="2. Offset"></a>2. Offset</h4><p>Offset is another outstanding tool in OBS color grading that controls the blacks&#x2F;Shadows of an image. It functions by altering the brightness levels and leaving the highlights and the mid-tones unaffected.</p>
<h4 id="3-Gain"><a href="#3-Gain" class="headerlink" title="3. Gain"></a>3. Gain</h4><p>A gain is a tool in OBS color correction that functions by only adjusting the white levels in an image. With the gain tool, brighter colors become brighter or darker.</p>
<p>Many people, especially beginner editors, experience difficulty differentiating between the Gamma and Offset tools. Yes, there is a closer similarity between the two, and for you to be on the safe side, you need to know that Gamma goes with the mid-tones (middle gray levels) whereas the Gain goes with highlights&#x2F;whites.</p>

Instead, you can use filters for color correction in OBS.</p>
<p>Apart from using OBS filters to color correct video clips and images, you can correct games, browser sources, and video capture devices.</p>
<p>There are various aspects of color correction in OBS. It includes:</p>
<h4 id="1-Gamma-3"><a href="#1-Gamma-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Gamma"></a>1. Gamma</h4><p>Gamma is a fundamental aspect in OBS that functions by balancing the brightness of an image through contrast. To be precise, Gamma works almost similarly to change in brightness while simultaneously increasing or decreasing the contrast.</p>
<p>In editing, Gamma is applicable mainly for removing shiny foreheads and webcam footage in gaming and browsing.</p>
<p>High Gamma is represented by “L,” whereas low Gamm is represented by “R.”</p>
<h4 id="2-Contrast-3"><a href="#2-Contrast-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Contrast"></a>2. Contrast</h4><p>Contrast is the difference in the degree of colors and tones in an image. Usually, the low contrast image has a narrow color range, whereas the high contrast images have dark shadows and bright highlights.</p>
<p>“L” represents high contrast in OBS contrast, whereas “R” represents low contrast.</p>
<h4 id="3-Brightness-3"><a href="#3-Brightness-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Brightness"></a>3. Brightness</h4><p>Brightness is the degree to how light or dark a picture is. To be able to understand an image clearly, it is best to correct its brightness. A change in brightness of a picture has a simultaneous change in pixels of that image.</p>

<h4 id="5-Hue-Shift-3"><a href="#5-Hue-Shift-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Hue Shift"></a>5. Hue Shift</h4><p>Hue shift is the change in an image’s saturation, lightness, and hue colors. Hue shifting occurs when highlighting or shading images. In OBS, you can use the hue shift functionality to reimage your image with a completely different color palette.</p>
<p>With the hue shift functionality in OBS, you can place the image on top of another and have an 80% opacity. It means that you will still see the first image when you place the second one on top of it.</p>
<p>The “L” sign in the OBS hue shift represents 50% opacity, while the “R” represents 100% Opacity.</p>
<h2 id="Color-Grade-in-OBS-3"><a href="#Color-Grade-in-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="Color Grade in OBS"></a>Color Grade in OBS</h2><p>Color grading is the process of enhancing the appearance of an image through attributes such as contrast, saturation, and color, making them enchanting for presentations. Color grading is not only done for still images but also for motion pictures and images.</p>
<p>Color grading functionality in OBS is encompassed with several tools – This includes:</p>
<h4 id="1-Lift-tool-3"><a href="#1-Lift-tool-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Lift tool"></a>1. Lift tool</h4><p>As the name suggests, lift tools are used in lifting or removing specific colors from an image. It does so without necessarily affecting other colors in an image.</p>
<p>With this tool, you can selectively remove unwanted colors from your image or video, replace them with your desired ones, and create astonishing results.</p>
<h4 id="2-Offset-3"><a href="#2-Offset-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Offset"></a>2. Offset</h4><p>Offset is another outstanding tool in OBS color grading that controls the blacks&#x2F;Shadows of an image. It functions by altering the brightness levels and leaving the highlights and the mid-tones unaffected.</p>
<h4 id="3-Gain-3"><a href="#3-Gain-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Gain"></a>3. Gain</h4><p>A gain is a tool in OBS color correction that functions by only adjusting the white levels in an image. With the gain tool, brighter colors become brighter or darker.</p>
<p>Many people, especially beginner editors, experience difficulty differentiating between the Gamma and Offset tools. Yes, there is a closer similarity between the two, and for you to be on the safe side, you need to know that Gamma goes with the mid-tones (middle gray levels) whereas the Gain goes with highlights&#x2F;whites.</p>

<p>There are free online lessons that may show you how to maneuver through the workspaces of video editing software, including how to create an interface, manage media, and trim footage, if you’re trying to learn video editing on the side. For its digital visual effects equivalent program, look through the Premiere Pro and After Effects tutorials provided by the American Graphic Institute.</p>
<p><strong>University programs</strong></p>
<p>There are four-year undergraduate degrees in film and cinema accessible for students who are interested in learning video editing over the long term and in a comprehensive way. These programs frequently mix theory and principal learning with project-based learning, enabling graduates to enter the workforce with contacts and experience that will help them land positions in the industry or launch their own video editing businesses.</p>
<p>Core courses for degrees in video editing highlight the critical abilities required for success. A job in video editing can be specialized by taking additional electives in areas like audio editing, animation, and special effects. Professors and coworkers from prior projects can offer letters of recommendation for job applications or reviews for a business website in addition to building a strong foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Independent or self-taught learning</strong></p>
<p>Collecting footage, uploading the clips, and experimenting with effect sequencing and other features are other ways to learn how to use video editing software. Researching the subject and watching tutorials won’t get you very far in the field of video editing; you need to get your hands dirty. However, reading through the software’s user manual to learn about fundamental uses and shortcuts is instructive.</p>
<p>Additionally, advanced techniques like color grading, sound effects, and media management can be learned through tutorials, books, and blog postings. It’s always a good idea to ask industry professionals for guidance. Video editors can produce high-quality work fast and start to identify their own editing preferences and style by using the advice of experts.</p>
<p>The likelihood of being selected to edit a project increases with credibility and expertise. Actively looking for employment possibilities is one approach to develop your skills as a video editor. Building a diversified portfolio and demo reel for new video editors can be facilitated by submitting proposals for video editing to nearby companies or posting job bids on freelance websites.</p>
<p>By enrolling in courses or earning a credential in video editing, you can compete for project bids in another method. Job seekers can establish credibility and show a dedication to learning their craft by taking outside training.</p>
<h2 id="5-Experience"><a href="#5-Experience" class="headerlink" title="5. Experience"></a>5. Experience</h2><p>As a video editor, education and practice go hand in hand. Naturally, you can’t begin working as a video editor without training because you first need to learn how to operate the program and comprehend the fundamental ideas and procedures involved in video editing. However, work experience is a crucial component of training because studying video editing on the job is the only way to truly understand it because it is such a collaborative process.</p>
<p>Therefore, you must first enroll in a formal course of some kind (there are some entirely self-taught video editors, but they remain the exception). You might want to pursue a Level 3 or Level 4 Diploma in Creative Media Production in the UK, for example, as this could be situated at a college or university. In the alternative, you could choose the flexibility an online course can provide if you are unable to afford the time and money required for full-time education.</p>
<p>Of course, you’d want to make sure it was a good one, and just because something is pricey doesn’t mean it’s good. If the course providers are unable to show evidence that graduates go on to obtain employment in the sector, you have your answer.</p>
<p>Additionally, you’ll need to learn how to use video editing software, which will definitely require some independent study even if it’s a requirement for your course. When you’re ready, you should start looking for experience anywhere you can. Although it would be ideal, most aspiring video editors will need to go elsewhere for internships, apprenticeships, and job placements. The dream would be to get a training program operated by a broadcaster like the BBC.</p>
<p>Sending out numerous inquiries, along with the greatest showreel you can put together, to production firms, advertising agencies, design studios, and others will probably be required to accomplish this. You will also probably have to endure numerous rejections.</p>
<p>It will also need that you support yourself while working a significant amount of hours for no pay. This is not ideal and severely discriminates against those from impoverished origins, much like the situation in other creative industries. However, it is regrettably the current reality in this intensely competitive profession. On the bright side, long-term perseverance should be rewarded with satisfying and artistically gratifying employment and respectable pay.</p>
<h2 id="6-Spend-time-on-networking"><a href="#6-Spend-time-on-networking" class="headerlink" title="6. Spend time on networking"></a>6. Spend time on networking</h2><p>Few things are more annoying than attempting to expand your business network while holed up in a room with no windows for most of the day. but connecting with others who are similarly hiding in their own dark spaces!</p>
<p>Since “I don’t want to annoy people” is the most common objection to sending cold emails, people frequently decide to attend mixers and live events instead because the crowds are friendlier. The issue with this approach is that it relies entirely on chance encounters at these events for your network to grow. You might attend weekly mixers for the rest of your career without ever meeting your perfect mentor or editing hero.</p>
<p>The chances are very high that the people who could give you career advice or even mentorship are stuck in their own dark rooms, working long hours, and avoiding networking events because they too are most likely introverted, given the likelihood that the editors, assistants, etc. that you really want (i.e. NEED to connect with) are introverted.</p>
<p>People want to see you succeed, so believe me when I say that you can’t expect them to come to you. You need to contact them. Because they want to use their free time to give back to the community, many editors at all levels of the industry are starting mentorship sites while also earning some income along in the process.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to read your life narrative if they don’t know who you are, and I’m sorry to have to break it to you. Contrary to what you might believe, this is not your “ONLY chance” I know how daunting it can be to reach out in the cold to someone you like who could potentially revolutionize your career with a simple referral. As I’ve already stated, the main goal of your first email is to elicit a response, so you shouldn’t feel compelled to include everything you’ve ever wanted to say in it.</p>
<p>Consider for a moment what kind of outreach email you would reply to if you were your receiver. Do you want to read about someone’s entire life, no matter how intriguing it may be, in one message? Do you know how to reply even if you did want to read it? Remember that even if you’ve given this message a lot of importance and it could affect your career, this person’s life will still go on even if they disregard your email.</p>
<p>You need to pay attention to the format of your email in addition to being mindful of its length. With smartphones and thumb-scrolling in the digital age, we have all evolved into “skimmers” rather than “readers.” Don’t send a single long text message. Use line breaks and “flag posts” to indicate the topic of each paragraph so the reader knows what to expect from each one.</p>
<h2 id="7-Get-your-first-job"><a href="#7-Get-your-first-job" class="headerlink" title="7. Get your first job"></a>7. Get your first job</h2><p>You must first realize that there are numerous ways to become an editor as well as numerous editing specializations. This indicates that there is no obvious course for you to take. This tutorial highlights the key steps you may take to take your first step toward a career in editing. To land your first junior video editing job, use one or more of these strategies:</p>
<p><strong>Assistant video editor</strong></p>
<p>The fact that more and more editing is being done remotely is fantastic. A digital nomad’s fantasy, indeed. Accordingly, some editors are searching for Assistant Editors (both local and remote) to assist them with their projects in every country on earth.</p>
<p>Find Assistant Editor positions that fit you based on your skill level, location, internet speeds, and career objectives by searching online and in forums. The numerous employment boards and recruiting websites, along with Craigslist, Facebook Groups, and membership websites like Shooting People, etc., are some good locations worth looking out.</p>
<p><strong>Contact YouTube creators</strong></p>
<p>A strategy that is becoming more and more popular for getting your first paid job is to approach YouTubers and offer your video editing services. This indicates fierce competitiveness. But if you discover the appropriate creator, you might appreciate the task. Be warned that there are short turnaround times and low pay. Don’t undersell yourself because there will always be someone else prepared to labor for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Network at events</strong></p>
<p>All film festivals were compelled to be held online due to the COVID virus. As limitations loosened, festivals began hosting both a live event and an online one. As a result, networking is now simpler than ever before — you don’t even need to get up from your desk!</p>
<p>Purchase a ticket to a film festival that showcases the genre of projects you are interested in working on and use the entire event to network. Be personable, not aggressive, and put yourself out there. Additionally, you may browse Vimeo for videos you enjoy and then get in touch with the editor or director to ask about potential opportunities as an assistant. However, networking in person is much simpler. The selling is done by your personality, which is challenging to convey with language.</p>
<p><strong>Use Fiverr or UpWork</strong></p>
<p>This method of landing your first job has a minimal barrier to entry. The problem is that wages are pitiful, and competition is intense. This can be a possibility for you if all you want is to practice and not earn a living. To achieve a position in these marketplaces where you may earn a living, it requires a lot of effort and time. And even then, the labor is generally monotonous. Avoid starting down this road and falling into the Fiverr loop. Due to your lack of connections and lack of expertise in the areas you would genuinely like to edit, it may be challenging for you to move on and work on more intriguing projects.</p>
<p>These are a few methods for getting your first job in video editing. You probably expected something more specific and logical. The problem is that nowadays, a lot of individuals have a PC in their bedroom that is capable of editing videos, so you have to work hard to stand out.</p>
<p>If I were to start again today, I would hound all the editing and post-production companies in my city, utilizing my outgoing personality and creative applications to entice them into granting me an entry-level position.</p>
<h2 id="8-The-best-locations-for-video-editing"><a href="#8-The-best-locations-for-video-editing" class="headerlink" title="8. The best locations for video editing"></a>8. The best locations for video editing</h2><p>When it comes to launching a career as a video editor, some locations are preferable to others. In this case, California, New Jersey, Hawaii, and New York are the finest states to live in. In California, video editors earn an average pay of $63,678. In contrast, they would average $62,559 and $61,479, respectively, in New Jersey and Hawaii.</p>
<p>Even though the average salary for video editors in New York is only $60,871, this is still greater than the national average. These are the states we found to have the most jobs and the highest salaries. We reduced our list of states to these four by determining the median wage, the cost of living, and the Location Quotient from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p>Los Angeles is the first place that springs to mindink about movies. And for good cause too! In Los Angeles, countless movies are shot, and every single one of them needs to be edited. About 8,810 video editors were employed in L.A. in 2014, and their average yearly salary was $105,370.</p>
<p>“I believe I’ll travel to Boston. In their 2005 song, “Boston,” Augustana sings, “I think I’ll start a new life, I think I’ll start it over.” So, pack your bags and travel to the city that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck adore. Rest easy knowing that the average yearly salary for 420 editors was $54,210.</p>
<p>Atlanta is the new movie location that production companies are picking. Video editors have relocated to Atlanta as a result of the switch to get a taste of the industry. 330 editors in Atlanta earned around $52,300 last year.</p>
<p>The dense forest of lush green trees in the Pacific Northwest is ideal for productions of Portlandia and Grimm. In Portland, where there are so many shows, young video editors are advancing their careers. In Portland, 300 video editors made about $46,560 last year.</p>
<p>Illinois provides a 30% tax credit for all eligible productions, much like Georgia does. If you work as an editor and make above $100,000 a year, Illinois will refund 30% of your earnings. Visit InVideo online to get access to a wealth of tools and features if you’re looking for a free video editing and creating platform that produces the best results.</p>
<p><strong>Places to avoid</strong></p>
<p>A quick look at the website for the Nebraska Film Commission will show you that the state is not the best for filming. Even though the most recent Alexander Payne movie was filmed in this state, its filmography is still quite little.</p>
<p>Mount Rushmore and the worst film commission website in history are both located in South Dakota. South Dakota makes up for its lack of a rich cinema heritage with its picturesque environment.</p>
<p>Idaho has beautiful countryside, but there are few chances for shooting and post-production. Since Idaho does not offer tax credits to filmmakers, many productions choose to shoot elsewhere.</p>
<p>Hawaii, the setting for the television shows Jurassic Park and Lost, comes in last on the list due to its high cost of living and lack of employment opportunities. A short search revealed that there are absolutely no video editing jobs available in Hawaii. It is expensive to reside in and shoot in Hawaii because a one-way ticket from Los Angeles to the islands costs $500.</p>
<h2 id="9-Working-in-teams"><a href="#9-Working-in-teams" class="headerlink" title="9. Working in teams"></a>9. Working in teams</h2><p>It’s not always necessary to work alone when editing videos. In actuality, as the name implies, it involves the whole team. Reputable companies frequently employ a team of specialists for various aspects of video editing. You’ll probably collaborate with a group that includes sound experts, cinematographers, and special effects creators. Enhancing collaboration guarantees the timely and error-free delivery of high-quality movies. Therefore, before beginning your career as a video editor, you must master this expertise.</p>
<p>Videos and films are frequently filmed out of order. For instance, the final scene might be filmed in the middle of production if the weather is right. As a result, you frequently receive unstructured data. As the video editor, it is your responsibility to follow the narrative.</p>
<p>You can depend on the main script, so don’t worry. But being aware of what’s happening will greatly simplify your life. Keeping in mind the setup of the scene and the intended concepts for each frame, for instance. Sticky notes and a good memory ensure that you never get off track.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Due to widespread digitalization, there is a high demand for video editing skills. Several well-known businesses are embracing digital media, particularly in the midst of the recent pandemic. The market has seen a sharp increase in demand for professional video editors. As a result, I covered how to become a video editor in this article along with everything else you need know. Thanks for reading!</p>

                      alt="choose the aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Step2Search for “Intro” from the list of templates on the Media tab. Choose a video clip that you want to use and drag it to your timeline. If you only want to use the free template, avoid the paid assets with a pink diamond icon. Otherwise, you can use free stock video clips included with Filmora.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step4Change, add or customize the audio of your video on the Audio menu. You can also add and customize the text, transition, and effect from other menus. Don’t forget to export your video to the preferred video format and locate it in your desired folder.</p>

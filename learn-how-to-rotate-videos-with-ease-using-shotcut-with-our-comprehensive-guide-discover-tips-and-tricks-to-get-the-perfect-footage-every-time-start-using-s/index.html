Having learnt about the fundamentals of creating over the top slideshows with Clideo, let us move ahead with working on some of the best tips to complement your already awesome graphic slideshow artwork with the most appealing audio in the following section:</p>

While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.</p>
<p>However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.</p>
<h3 id="02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices"><a href="#02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices" class="headerlink" title="02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices"></a>02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices</h3><p>When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.</p>
<p>You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.</p>

When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.</p>
<p>If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.</p>

All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.</p>
<p>Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.</p>

Having learnt about the fundamentals of creating over the top slideshows with Clideo, let us move ahead with working on some of the best tips to complement your already awesome graphic slideshow artwork with the most appealing audio in the following section:</p>

While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.</p>
<p>However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.</p>
<h3 id="02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-1"><a href="#02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-1" class="headerlink" title="02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices"></a>02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices</h3><p>When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.</p>
<p>You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.</p>

When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.</p>
<p>If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.</p>

All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.</p>
<p>Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.</p>

Having learnt about the fundamentals of creating over the top slideshows with Clideo, let us move ahead with working on some of the best tips to complement your already awesome graphic slideshow artwork with the most appealing audio in the following section:</p>

While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.</p>
<p>However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.</p>
<h3 id="02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-2"><a href="#02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-2" class="headerlink" title="02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices"></a>02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices</h3><p>When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.</p>
<p>You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.</p>

When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.</p>
<p>If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.</p>

All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.</p>
<p>Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.</p>

While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.</p>
<p>However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.</p>
<h3 id="02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-3"><a href="#02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-3" class="headerlink" title="02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices"></a>02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices</h3><p>When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.</p>
<p>You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.</p>

When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.</p>
<p>If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.</p>

All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.</p>
<p>Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design"><a href="#Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design" class="headerlink" title="Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design"></a>Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design</h2><p>Creating GIFs for infotainment or casual information sharing is the current talk of the trend. You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning <strong>GIF design</strong>.</p>
<p>When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:</p>
<h3 id="01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness"><a href="#01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness" class="headerlink" title="01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness"></a>01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness</h3><p>The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.</p>
<p>As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.</p>
<h3 id="02Maintain-Visual-Identity"><a href="#02Maintain-Visual-Identity" class="headerlink" title="02Maintain Visual Identity"></a>02Maintain Visual Identity</h3><p>An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to <strong>design GIF</strong> is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.</p>
<p>Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.</p>

<h3 id="03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames"><a href="#03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames" class="headerlink" title="03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames"></a>03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames</h3><p>Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.</p>
<p>To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.</p>
<h3 id="04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible"><a href="#04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible" class="headerlink" title="04Make Your GIF Accessible"></a>04Make Your GIF Accessible</h3><p>You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.</p>
<p>Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.</p>
<p>Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.</p>

<h3 id="05Use-Storyboards"><a href="#05Use-Storyboards" class="headerlink" title="05Use Storyboards"></a>05Use Storyboards</h3><p>When aiming to create visibly appealing GIFs, you need to lay considerable stress on choosing an apt background story. Don’t get misled by the wrong assumption of using any random background, owing to the short play duration of GIFs. An impressive solution to this concern is taking the help of a storyboard to keep track of your GIF’s content flow.</p>
<p>Using a storyboard is quite effective means of being in line with the direction of content movement, rescuing you from the hustle of going off the track. This comes explicitly handy when you are working with a team of creators. The storyboard is there to keep everything at the exact place, thus improving member communications and boosting up the design process.</p>

<h3 id="06Focus-on-Creating-Loops"><a href="#06Focus-on-Creating-Loops" class="headerlink" title="06Focus on Creating Loops"></a>06Focus on Creating Loops</h3><p>Consider creating an animated motion loop for your GIF allowing a repeated and comprehensive view of your content. Looping projects a deeper observation of the clip and its contents in a seamless transition. However, creating an infinite motion loop in GIFs is quite tricky, as you need to pay utmost concern to ensure a smooth content flow and chances of even the slightest errors are not entertained.</p>
<p>Any loopholes in placement of your GIF elements will get noticed within a blink and lead to an unsatisfactory user experience. Hence, you need to check each of your content frames separately to eliminate chances of possible errors. If you are a beginner, try working with geometrical animations to get the initial pickup. This will be advantageous in deciding the exact element positions at the start and end of the GIF.</p>

<h3 id="07Make-Use-of-Motion-Blur"><a href="#07Make-Use-of-Motion-Blur" class="headerlink" title="07Make Use of Motion Blur"></a>07Make Use of Motion Blur</h3><p>Using the concept of motion blur is pivotal in providing a natural flow and feel to your GIF, which, in an otherwise case would ordinarily appear as a mere collection of static images clubbed together. This would give a wobbling feel with unsteady frame movements to your viewers. The motion blur effect potentially ensures a smooth content flow, and your GIF looks like a short video captured from a camera.</p>

<h3 id="08Stick-to-a-Reduced-File-Size"><a href="#08Stick-to-a-Reduced-File-Size" class="headerlink" title="08Stick to a Reduced File Size"></a>08Stick to a Reduced File Size</h3><p>Creating GIF of within a standard size range is quite difficult, owing to the fact that these are shared across a variety of media platforms, each having a different file size constraint. It is, however, recommended to stick to a file size as low as possible to escape the notch of modifying the same, ener5y time you need to work with the GIF on a different platform.</p>
<p>Listed below are a few ways to limit your GIF to a lower file size:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict your GIF to a frame count under 150, exceeding which, it will get difficult to export the GIF to most of the commonly visited social media and content sharing platforms.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When your GIF is ready to export, adjust its lossy parameter between 5 and 10 to boost the file compression rate. Look for a setting that decreases the effective file size without compromising with the overall <strong>GIF design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict to a minimum possible color usage. This will not only intensify the <strong>GIF design</strong>, but also contribute in maintaining a decreased file size. You can instead, focus on playing with animations or adjusting your image frames to longer play durations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Don’t experiment with multiple background gradients in your GIF. You can select from either a completely opaque, or a totally transparent background. Adding unnecessary gradients will end up giving your GIF a hazy look, along with a visibly large file that will be difficult to export non any platform.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design-1"><a href="#Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design"></a>Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design</h2><p>Creating GIFs for infotainment or casual information sharing is the current talk of the trend. You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning <strong>GIF design</strong>.</p>
<p>When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:</p>
<h3 id="01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-1"><a href="#01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-1" class="headerlink" title="01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness"></a>01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness</h3><p>The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.</p>
<p>As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.</p>
<h3 id="02Maintain-Visual-Identity-1"><a href="#02Maintain-Visual-Identity-1" class="headerlink" title="02Maintain Visual Identity"></a>02Maintain Visual Identity</h3><p>An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to <strong>design GIF</strong> is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.</p>
<p>Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.</p>

<h3 id="03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-1"><a href="#03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-1" class="headerlink" title="03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames"></a>03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames</h3><p>Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.</p>
<p>To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.</p>
<h3 id="04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-1"><a href="#04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-1" class="headerlink" title="04Make Your GIF Accessible"></a>04Make Your GIF Accessible</h3><p>You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.</p>
<p>Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.</p>
<p>Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.</p>

<h3 id="05Use-Storyboards-1"><a href="#05Use-Storyboards-1" class="headerlink" title="05Use Storyboards"></a>05Use Storyboards</h3><p>When aiming to create visibly appealing GIFs, you need to lay considerable stress on choosing an apt background story. Don’t get misled by the wrong assumption of using any random background, owing to the short play duration of GIFs. An impressive solution to this concern is taking the help of a storyboard to keep track of your GIF’s content flow.</p>
<p>Using a storyboard is quite effective means of being in line with the direction of content movement, rescuing you from the hustle of going off the track. This comes explicitly handy when you are working with a team of creators. The storyboard is there to keep everything at the exact place, thus improving member communications and boosting up the design process.</p>

<h3 id="06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-1"><a href="#06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-1" class="headerlink" title="06Focus on Creating Loops"></a>06Focus on Creating Loops</h3><p>Consider creating an animated motion loop for your GIF allowing a repeated and comprehensive view of your content. Looping projects a deeper observation of the clip and its contents in a seamless transition. However, creating an infinite motion loop in GIFs is quite tricky, as you need to pay utmost concern to ensure a smooth content flow and chances of even the slightest errors are not entertained.</p>
<p>Any loopholes in placement of your GIF elements will get noticed within a blink and lead to an unsatisfactory user experience. Hence, you need to check each of your content frames separately to eliminate chances of possible errors. If you are a beginner, try working with geometrical animations to get the initial pickup. This will be advantageous in deciding the exact element positions at the start and end of the GIF.</p>

This would give a wobbling feel with unsteady frame movements to your viewers. The motion blur effect potentially ensures a smooth content flow, and your GIF looks like a short video captured from a camera.</p>

It is, however, recommended to stick to a file size as low as possible to escape the notch of modifying the same, ener5y time you need to work with the GIF on a different platform.</p>
<p>Listed below are a few ways to limit your GIF to a lower file size:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict your GIF to a frame count under 150, exceeding which, it will get difficult to export the GIF to most of the commonly visited social media and content sharing platforms.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When your GIF is ready to export, adjust its lossy parameter between 5 and 10 to boost the file compression rate. Look for a setting that decreases the effective file size without compromising with the overall <strong>GIF design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict to a minimum possible color usage. This will not only intensify the <strong>GIF design</strong>, but also contribute in maintaining a decreased file size. You can instead, focus on playing with animations or adjusting your image frames to longer play durations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Don’t experiment with multiple background gradients in your GIF. You can select from either a completely opaque, or a totally transparent background. Adding unnecessary gradients will end up giving your GIF a hazy look, along with a visibly large file that will be difficult to export non any platform.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design-2"><a href="#Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design"></a>Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design</h2><p>Creating GIFs for infotainment or casual information sharing is the current talk of the trend. You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning <strong>GIF design</strong>.</p>
<p>When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:</p>
<h3 id="01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-2"><a href="#01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-2" class="headerlink" title="01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness"></a>01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness</h3><p>The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.</p>
<p>As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.</p>
<h3 id="02Maintain-Visual-Identity-2"><a href="#02Maintain-Visual-Identity-2" class="headerlink" title="02Maintain Visual Identity"></a>02Maintain Visual Identity</h3><p>An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to <strong>design GIF</strong> is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.</p>
<p>Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.</p>

<h3 id="03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-2"><a href="#03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-2" class="headerlink" title="03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames"></a>03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames</h3><p>Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.</p>
<p>To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.</p>
<h3 id="04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-2"><a href="#04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-2" class="headerlink" title="04Make Your GIF Accessible"></a>04Make Your GIF Accessible</h3><p>You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.</p>
<p>Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.</p>
<p>Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.</p>

<h3 id="05Use-Storyboards-2"><a href="#05Use-Storyboards-2" class="headerlink" title="05Use Storyboards"></a>05Use Storyboards</h3><p>When aiming to create visibly appealing GIFs, you need to lay considerable stress on choosing an apt background story. Don’t get misled by the wrong assumption of using any random background, owing to the short play duration of GIFs. An impressive solution to this concern is taking the help of a storyboard to keep track of your GIF’s content flow.</p>
<p>Using a storyboard is quite effective means of being in line with the direction of content movement, rescuing you from the hustle of going off the track. This comes explicitly handy when you are working with a team of creators. The storyboard is there to keep everything at the exact place, thus improving member communications and boosting up the design process.</p>

<h3 id="06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-2"><a href="#06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-2" class="headerlink" title="06Focus on Creating Loops"></a>06Focus on Creating Loops</h3><p>Consider creating an animated motion loop for your GIF allowing a repeated and comprehensive view of your content. Looping projects a deeper observation of the clip and its contents in a seamless transition. However, creating an infinite motion loop in GIFs is quite tricky, as you need to pay utmost concern to ensure a smooth content flow and chances of even the slightest errors are not entertained.</p>
<p>Any loopholes in placement of your GIF elements will get noticed within a blink and lead to an unsatisfactory user experience. Hence, you need to check each of your content frames separately to eliminate chances of possible errors. If you are a beginner, try working with geometrical animations to get the initial pickup. This will be advantageous in deciding the exact element positions at the start and end of the GIF.</p>

This would give a wobbling feel with unsteady frame movements to your viewers. The motion blur effect potentially ensures a smooth content flow, and your GIF looks like a short video captured from a camera.</p>

It is, however, recommended to stick to a file size as low as possible to escape the notch of modifying the same, ener5y time you need to work with the GIF on a different platform.</p>
<p>Listed below are a few ways to limit your GIF to a lower file size:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict your GIF to a frame count under 150, exceeding which, it will get difficult to export the GIF to most of the commonly visited social media and content sharing platforms.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When your GIF is ready to export, adjust its lossy parameter between 5 and 10 to boost the file compression rate. Look for a setting that decreases the effective file size without compromising with the overall <strong>GIF design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict to a minimum possible color usage. This will not only intensify the <strong>GIF design</strong>, but also contribute in maintaining a decreased file size. You can instead, focus on playing with animations or adjusting your image frames to longer play durations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Don’t experiment with multiple background gradients in your GIF. You can select from either a completely opaque, or a totally transparent background. Adding unnecessary gradients will end up giving your GIF a hazy look, along with a visibly large file that will be difficult to export non any platform.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design-3"><a href="#Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design"></a>Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design</h2><p>Creating GIFs for infotainment or casual information sharing is the current talk of the trend. You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning <strong>GIF design</strong>.</p>
<p>When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:</p>
<h3 id="01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-3"><a href="#01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-3" class="headerlink" title="01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness"></a>01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness</h3><p>The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.</p>
<p>As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.</p>
<h3 id="02Maintain-Visual-Identity-3"><a href="#02Maintain-Visual-Identity-3" class="headerlink" title="02Maintain Visual Identity"></a>02Maintain Visual Identity</h3><p>An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to <strong>design GIF</strong> is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.</p>
<p>Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.</p>

<h3 id="03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-3"><a href="#03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-3" class="headerlink" title="03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames"></a>03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames</h3><p>Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.</p>
<p>To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.</p>
<h3 id="04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-3"><a href="#04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-3" class="headerlink" title="04Make Your GIF Accessible"></a>04Make Your GIF Accessible</h3><p>You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.</p>
<p>Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.</p>
<p>Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.</p>

<h3 id="05Use-Storyboards-3"><a href="#05Use-Storyboards-3" class="headerlink" title="05Use Storyboards"></a>05Use Storyboards</h3><p>When aiming to create visibly appealing GIFs, you need to lay considerable stress on choosing an apt background story. Don’t get misled by the wrong assumption of using any random background, owing to the short play duration of GIFs. An impressive solution to this concern is taking the help of a storyboard to keep track of your GIF’s content flow.</p>
<p>Using a storyboard is quite effective means of being in line with the direction of content movement, rescuing you from the hustle of going off the track. This comes explicitly handy when you are working with a team of creators. The storyboard is there to keep everything at the exact place, thus improving member communications and boosting up the design process.</p>

<h3 id="06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-3"><a href="#06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-3" class="headerlink" title="06Focus on Creating Loops"></a>06Focus on Creating Loops</h3><p>Consider creating an animated motion loop for your GIF allowing a repeated and comprehensive view of your content. Looping projects a deeper observation of the clip and its contents in a seamless transition. However, creating an infinite motion loop in GIFs is quite tricky, as you need to pay utmost concern to ensure a smooth content flow and chances of even the slightest errors are not entertained.</p>
<p>Any loopholes in placement of your GIF elements will get noticed within a blink and lead to an unsatisfactory user experience. Hence, you need to check each of your content frames separately to eliminate chances of possible errors. If you are a beginner, try working with geometrical animations to get the initial pickup. This will be advantageous in deciding the exact element positions at the start and end of the GIF.</p>

This would give a wobbling feel with unsteady frame movements to your viewers. The motion blur effect potentially ensures a smooth content flow, and your GIF looks like a short video captured from a camera.</p>

It is, however, recommended to stick to a file size as low as possible to escape the notch of modifying the same, ener5y time you need to work with the GIF on a different platform.</p>
<p>Listed below are a few ways to limit your GIF to a lower file size:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict your GIF to a frame count under 150, exceeding which, it will get difficult to export the GIF to most of the commonly visited social media and content sharing platforms.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When your GIF is ready to export, adjust its lossy parameter between 5 and 10 to boost the file compression rate. Look for a setting that decreases the effective file size without compromising with the overall <strong>GIF design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict to a minimum possible color usage. This will not only intensify the <strong>GIF design</strong>, but also contribute in maintaining a decreased file size. You can instead, focus on playing with animations or adjusting your image frames to longer play durations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Don’t experiment with multiple background gradients in your GIF. You can select from either a completely opaque, or a totally transparent background. Adding unnecessary gradients will end up giving your GIF a hazy look, along with a visibly large file that will be difficult to export non any platform.</p>

Anyone can do it, but before you get started, we will share some do’s and don’ts to help you get the best results.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many ways to set up a green screen, but the most cost-efficient way is with a green screen fabric. If you are using a green fabric as a DIY green screen, make sure you steam or iron it out, whether taping it to a wall or hanging it off the rack. Keep in mind the green screen should not leave any wrinkles.</p>
<p>It is because wrinkles will make lighting the green screen a nightmare, and uneven lighting will leave you with shadows and disappointing results. It would help if you also pulled the green screen tight to get a seamless background. The better you do with the setup, the easier it will be the key it out later</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Lighting-a-Green-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Lighting-a-Green-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Lighting a Green Screen"></a>Part 3: Lighting a Green Screen</h2><p>It doesn’t matter how nice your green screen is. You won’t get good results if you don’t light it properly. When you light a green screen, be aware of these things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure there are at least six feet of space between you and your green screen; therefore, you’re not casting a shadow that cannot be keyed out later.</li>
<li>Remember, any shadow on the green screen is bad. The lighting on the screen should be flat, even, and one-dimensional meaning. Please don’t place the screen leaning at an angle since they’ll make it harder to light evenly.</li>
<li>Do light yourself and your background separately. It will ensure your subject wouldn’t bleed into the green, which will create a halo around them.</li>
<li>After you key out the green screen and lighting, your subjects should emulate the lighting from your final footage. For example, if you know sunlight is coming from the left light, your subject is from the left direction as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-4-Keying-out-your-green-screen"><a href="#Part-4-Keying-out-your-green-screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Keying out your green screen"></a>Part 4. Keying out your green screen</h2><p>Once your footage is good, go into <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and import it into your timeline, then double-click it to find the chroma key menu. However, don’t stop there. Clicking the chroma key button is not enough to guarantee perfectly keyed footage, so play around with the offset tolerance edge thickness and edge feather. Lastly, adjust it to make sure your edit looks as good as possible.</p>

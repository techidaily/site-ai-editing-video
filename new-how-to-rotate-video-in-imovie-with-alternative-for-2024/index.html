A video clip can turn in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, in 90° increments. Different video-making and editing software or applications have other steps to carry out this process. However, the result is the same for all, a change in the orientation of the video.</p>
<p>People rotate video clips for a variety of reasons. Here are some reasons as to why you may want to change video orientation in iMovie:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video stylization: While a rotated video may look disoriented, editors sometimes use the technique to convey a particular mood or emotion.</li>
<li>Continuity: Video clip rotation can help you correct production errors or last-minute effect changes.</li>
<li>Correct disorientation: Sometimes, as a result of errors while shooting, especially when using a mobile device, some video clips may appear in a lateral direction; video rotation can help fix this.</li>
<li>Create horizontal videos: With a change in video orientation, you can make some footage like backgrounds appear vertically or horizontally.</li>

<p>04 [How to Convert JPG to Transparent PNG](#Part 4)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-Transparent-PNG-Background"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-Transparent-PNG-Background" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is a Transparent PNG Background?"></a>Part 1 What Is a Transparent PNG Background?</h2><p>Transparent backgrounds are essentially faded overlays to any graphic content, like, an image or a video, that are useful in emphasizing the main element in the substance. Compatible to a variety of image and video formats, these are the talk of the trend, owing to their excellent content promotion utility. These are the latest and creative examples of information presentation, along with being among the best branding tools that can potentially make your content fresh and unique.</p>
<p>Using a transparent background as a brand promotion tool helps to project forward the major highlights of your product with a supportive background image, like the brand logo. This helps the audience to have a general idea of your brand. Apart from this, you can also assure the authenticity and quality of your brand by using a watermark in the background image.</p>
<p>Images with transparent backgrounds are the current promotion trends, owing to their convenient compatibility with any web design and the flexibility to mix with the most diverse color palettes and different elements on the product webpage. These can further be easily rendered in 3D to present realistic product images.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF"></a>Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF</h2><p>Diversity in requirement and usage has led to the advent of a variety of image formats, each suited to a specific purpose. On account of this variation, it becomes a confusing task to select the best image format that can fetch the most affordable images results in cohesion with exact user needs.</p>
<p>It is recommenced to use the JPG image format for natural stills that have a smooth variations in intensity and color. If your content requires image transparency, or contains texts and elements that have a sharp contrast image, like a brand logo, you should ideally prefer the PNG image format, while the GIF format is best suited for presenting animated content. As an explanation to the above usage constraints, here’s a comparison of the popular PNG, JPG and GIF image formats in the light of some common credibility parameters.</p>
<h3 id="01Compression"><a href="#01Compression" class="headerlink" title="01Compression"></a>01Compression</h3><p>Image compression facilitates a quick data transmission across different web based platforms, owing to the reduced file size. While compression can be either lossy or lossless, choose an image format that maintains the size credibility in resonance with your data needs. A lossless compression guarantees the retrieval of original image, but a lossy compression fails to do so.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format is a lossy compressor that plays on your ability to perceive. The format has the credibility of a 1:10 compression ratio, without comprising with the original image quality. However, a further increased compression ratio may generate perceivable differences in image quality.</p>
<p>The JPG compression utilizes the concept of Discrete Cosine Transform, i.e., a color averaging of the image pixels in close proximity. Hence, it is suitable to use this format for natural and scenic stills, having a smooth color and intensity transition. Preferring this image format for a transmission of high contrast and sharpened images is however, not advisable.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>This format supports the Deflate Compression technique and neither introduces artefacts, nor cuts down on the image quality. Choose the PNG image format for a lossless and high quality compression in comparison to JPG. This one is a more effective format with higher image quality, sharper image presentation and occupies a larger memory space on your device.</p>
<p>You can rely on PNG images for presenting data with text, shapes and logos with high contrast pixelation. It is however, not a good choice for transferring digital images that have a high resolution.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>Working on the LZW Compression Algorithm, this image format was originally used to showcase simple website graphics, when the PNG format was still at a developing stage. However, with the advancement of PNG as a more effective compression format, the use of GIF is now restricted to animated content sharing.</p>
<h3 id="02Transparency"><a href="#02Transparency" class="headerlink" title="02Transparency"></a>02Transparency</h3><p>Transparency is tern used to describe some invisible content. This is suitable to use in image backgrounds when you need to lay extra stress on the main content, like the logo of your product with a cohesive brand text, etc. the transparent background used here facilitates the use of a particular image with a series of background and color variations.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format has a limitation of not being compatible with image transparency, and hence is not suitable for related applications.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The PNG format gives you the liberty to use image transparency in two selective ways. You can either choose to make your image partially transparent by an alpha channel insertion for a smooth edge-background blend, or use index transparency to make the pixels of any particular color as transparent. PNG8 AND PNG24 versions of the format are supportive of index and alpha channel transparencies respectively.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>This format inherently supports index transparency and declares a chosen color on the palette as transparent. Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.</p>
<p>While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.</p>
<h3 id="03Color"><a href="#03Color" class="headerlink" title="03Color"></a>03Color</h3><p>Color is a visibly strong parameter of difference among the JPG, PNG and GIF image formats, with each one supporting as specific number of colors on the palette.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The color palette of JPG images is a huge inventory of 16 million colors, rendering them suitable for storing natural stills having a smooth color transition.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The two versions of PNG format differ on color variance. While PNG8 permits 256 colors, the PNG24 format supports 16 million colors, similar to the JPG format. Consider using the PNG8 format for an image with simple shapes and lesser variations in color. It is, on the other hand better to use the PNG24 format for images with transparent backgrounds, high image quality and complex shapes with detailed edges.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>The GIF format is a host to 256 colors, one of which becomes transparent on using index transparency and the other 255 support different color variations.</p>
<h3 id="04Animation"><a href="#04Animation" class="headerlink" title="04Animation"></a>04Animation</h3><p>Animation here, is not necessarily restricted to having frame rates, but refers to a certain periodic movement of specific image sections with time. Out of JPG, PNG and GIF, only the last one is compatible with GIFs. You can use this utility to crate and share eye catching banners and advertisements. The advent of GIF specific content platforms, such as, GIPHY, Tumblr, etc., has further uplifted GIF reach and usage.</p>
<p>A variety of image formats are available to choose from for catering to specific content requirements. However, you can always optimize the format selection in cohesion with the current need.</p>

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download Adobe Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to Adobe’s official website and download the Photoshop application in your device. Install and launch the same to reach the app’s welcome interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-9.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Inage Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a Layered Image File</strong></p>
<p>In the main interface, open a selected image and navigate to the ‘Layers Panel’ in the right of the image window. However, if the ‘Layers Panel’ does not show up by default, reach to the top toolbar and hit the ‘Window’ tab. From the drop sown menu that follows, select ‘Layers’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-10.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Layering Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In this panel, double tap the ‘Background‘layer. This causes the ‘Rename Layer’ dialog box to appear. You can either enter a suitable name or continue with the default ‘Layer 0’ name. When you are done, click on ‘OK’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-11.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Layer Rename Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Let’s Get Creating!</strong></p>
<p>In the application interface, navigate to the toolbar at the left and choose the ‘Magic Wand’ tool. Again, reach to the ‘Options’ bar at the top and choose ‘Select Subject’. This will facilitate the selection of the min object of the image, irrespective of its background and the selection will be visible as ‘marching ants’ around the object.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-12.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Magic Wand Tool Selection"
                ></p>
<p>If you find the selection to be improper, use the ‘Magic Wand’ to ward off excessive background portions by choosing the ’Subtract From Selection’ option, or even add some extra product portions, suited to your requirement. While making your selection, take care to include any holes in the product image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Subject Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Background Deletion</strong></p>
<p>When you are left with only the selected product, navigate to the top toolbar and hit the ’Select’ tab and choose ‘Inverse’ from the drop down menu that follows. You can alternatively use the ‘Shift+Ctrl+I’ command for a Windows device, or enter ‘Shift+Command+I’ command, in case you are using a Mac supported device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-14.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application-Background Inverse Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Make a selection of the inverse background and tap ‘Backspace’ or ‘Delete’ in your Windows and Mac devices respectively. This will cause your background to get transparent. In the Photoshop application, a gray-white checkerboard represents a transparent background.</p>
<p>In case you require deselecting any selection, enter ‘Ctrl+D’ in Windows or ‘Command+D’ in a Mac device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-15.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Section Deselect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save Your Creation in a Web Compatible Format</strong></p>
<p>When you are done creating the transparent background artwork, it becomes equally important to save your creation in a web compatible format to export them on different media platforms and product websites.</p>
<p>Talking of the preferable image format, it is highly recommended to use the PNG24 one, owing to its flexibility of alpha channel transparency, which permits partially transparent image backgrounds along with layered transparency. This in turn makes it possible to integrate the image with varying color backgrounds on different sites and platforms without hollow pixelation.</p>
<p>To save your artwork in the PNG24 file format, navigate to the application toolbar bat the top and hit the ‘File’ tab and choose the ‘Export’ option from the drop sown menu that appears. Select the ‘Export As’ option from the ‘Export’ popup menu.</p>
<p>For an older Photoshop version, hit the ‘Export’ tab and choose ‘Save for Web’ from the dropdown menu, followed by selecting the PNG24 option. A format dialog box appears where you can set the transparency settings. To do this, navigate to ‘File Settings’ at the right, choose the PNG file format and check the ‘Transparency’ box. Avoid checking the ‘Smaller Size’ box, else the image will get saved in the PNG8 format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-16.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Export Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In the left of the screen, the image file size is displayed. Maintain an affordable file size, preferably within 200 KB, to avoid slower image loading on the sharing platform. You can adjust this in the ‘Image Size’ option at the right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-17.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Transparency and Size Settings Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Set a conveniently reduced dimension, while taking care not to set an extremely small size, else it will produce a pixelated output on the site. It is preferable to set a 50-100% larger image size for a convenient display across different devices.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Final Save</strong></p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with all the image settings, tap ‘Export All’ to save your artwork locally in your device. In the ‘File Save’ dialog box, choose a preferred device location, enter a suitable file name and choose the .png extension. At last, click on ‘Save’.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF-1"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF"></a>Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF</h2><p>Diversity in requirement and usage has led to the advent of a variety of image formats, each suited to a specific purpose. On account of this variation, it becomes a confusing task to select the best image format that can fetch the most affordable images results in cohesion with exact user needs.</p>
<p>It is recommenced to use the JPG image format for natural stills that have a smooth variations in intensity and color. If your content requires image transparency, or contains texts and elements that have a sharp contrast image, like a brand logo, you should ideally prefer the PNG image format, while the GIF format is best suited for presenting animated content. As an explanation to the above usage constraints, here’s a comparison of the popular PNG, JPG and GIF image formats in the light of some common credibility parameters.</p>
<h3 id="01Compression-1"><a href="#01Compression-1" class="headerlink" title="01Compression"></a>01Compression</h3><p>Image compression facilitates a quick data transmission across different web based platforms, owing to the reduced file size. While compression can be either lossy or lossless, choose an image format that maintains the size credibility in resonance with your data needs. A lossless compression guarantees the retrieval of original image, but a lossy compression fails to do so.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format is a lossy compressor that plays on your ability to perceive. The format has the credibility of a 1:10 compression ratio, without comprising with the original image quality. However, a further increased compression ratio may generate perceivable differences in image quality.</p>
<p>The JPG compression utilizes the concept of Discrete Cosine Transform, i.e., a color averaging of the image pixels in close proximity. Hence, it is suitable to use this format for natural and scenic stills, having a smooth color and intensity transition. Preferring this image format for a transmission of high contrast and sharpened images is however, not advisable.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>This format supports the Deflate Compression technique and neither introduces artefacts, nor cuts down on the image quality. Choose the PNG image format for a lossless and high quality compression in comparison to JPG. This one is a more effective format with higher image quality, sharper image presentation and occupies a larger memory space on your device.</p>
<p>You can rely on PNG images for presenting data with text, shapes and logos with high contrast pixelation. It is however, not a good choice for transferring digital images that have a high resolution.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>Working on the LZW Compression Algorithm, this image format was originally used to showcase simple website graphics, when the PNG format was still at a developing stage. However, with the advancement of PNG as a more effective compression format, the use of GIF is now restricted to animated content sharing.</p>
<h3 id="02Transparency-1"><a href="#02Transparency-1" class="headerlink" title="02Transparency"></a>02Transparency</h3><p>Transparency is tern used to describe some invisible content. This is suitable to use in image backgrounds when you need to lay extra stress on the main content, like the logo of your product with a cohesive brand text, etc. the transparent background used here facilitates the use of a particular image with a series of background and color variations.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format has a limitation of not being compatible with image transparency, and hence is not suitable for related applications.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The PNG format gives you the liberty to use image transparency in two selective ways. You can either choose to make your image partially transparent by an alpha channel insertion for a smooth edge-background blend, or use index transparency to make the pixels of any particular color as transparent. PNG8 AND PNG24 versions of the format are supportive of index and alpha channel transparencies respectively.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>This format inherently supports index transparency and declares a chosen color on the palette as transparent. Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.</p>
<p>While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.</p>
<h3 id="03Color-1"><a href="#03Color-1" class="headerlink" title="03Color"></a>03Color</h3><p>Color is a visibly strong parameter of difference among the JPG, PNG and GIF image formats, with each one supporting as specific number of colors on the palette.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The color palette of JPG images is a huge inventory of 16 million colors, rendering them suitable for storing natural stills having a smooth color transition.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The two versions of PNG format differ on color variance. While PNG8 permits 256 colors, the PNG24 format supports 16 million colors, similar to the JPG format. Consider using the PNG8 format for an image with simple shapes and lesser variations in color. It is, on the other hand better to use the PNG24 format for images with transparent backgrounds, high image quality and complex shapes with detailed edges.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>The GIF format is a host to 256 colors, one of which becomes transparent on using index transparency and the other 255 support different color variations.</p>
<h3 id="04Animation-1"><a href="#04Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="04Animation"></a>04Animation</h3><p>Animation here, is not necessarily restricted to having frame rates, but refers to a certain periodic movement of specific image sections with time. Out of JPG, PNG and GIF, only the last one is compatible with GIFs. You can use this utility to crate and share eye catching banners and advertisements. The advent of GIF specific content platforms, such as, GIPHY, Tumblr, etc., has further uplifted GIF reach and usage.</p>
<p>A variety of image formats are available to choose from for catering to specific content requirements. However, you can always optimize the format selection in cohesion with the current need.</p>

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download Adobe Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to Adobe’s official website and download the Photoshop application in your device. Install and launch the same to reach the app’s welcome interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Inage Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a Layered Image File</strong></p>
<p>In the main interface, open a selected image and navigate to the ‘Layers Panel’ in the right of the image window. However, if the ‘Layers Panel’ does not show up by default, reach to the top toolbar and hit the ‘Window’ tab. From the drop sown menu that follows, select ‘Layers’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Layering Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In this panel, double tap the ‘Background‘layer. This causes the ‘Rename Layer’ dialog box to appear. You can either enter a suitable name or continue with the default ‘Layer 0’ name. When you are done, click on ‘OK’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Layer Rename Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Let’s Get Creating!</strong></p>
<p>In the application interface, navigate to the toolbar at the left and choose the ‘Magic Wand’ tool. Again, reach to the ‘Options’ bar at the top and choose ‘Select Subject’. This will facilitate the selection of the min object of the image, irrespective of its background and the selection will be visible as ‘marching ants’ around the object.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-12.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Magic Wand Tool Selection"
                ></p>
<p>If you find the selection to be improper, use the ‘Magic Wand’ to ward off excessive background portions by choosing the ’Subtract From Selection’ option, or even add some extra product portions, suited to your requirement. While making your selection, take care to include any holes in the product image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Subject Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Background Deletion</strong></p>
<p>When you are left with only the selected product, navigate to the top toolbar and hit the ’Select’ tab and choose ‘Inverse’ from the drop down menu that follows. You can alternatively use the ‘Shift+Ctrl+I’ command for a Windows device, or enter ‘Shift+Command+I’ command, in case you are using a Mac supported device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-14.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application-Background Inverse Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Make a selection of the inverse background and tap ‘Backspace’ or ‘Delete’ in your Windows and Mac devices respectively. This will cause your background to get transparent. In the Photoshop application, a gray-white checkerboard represents a transparent background.</p>
<p>In case you require deselecting any selection, enter ‘Ctrl+D’ in Windows or ‘Command+D’ in a Mac device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-15.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Section Deselect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save Your Creation in a Web Compatible Format</strong></p>
<p>When you are done creating the transparent background artwork, it becomes equally important to save your creation in a web compatible format to export them on different media platforms and product websites.</p>
<p>Talking of the preferable image format, it is highly recommended to use the PNG24 one, owing to its flexibility of alpha channel transparency, which permits partially transparent image backgrounds along with layered transparency. This in turn makes it possible to integrate the image with varying color backgrounds on different sites and platforms without hollow pixelation.</p>
<p>To save your artwork in the PNG24 file format, navigate to the application toolbar bat the top and hit the ‘File’ tab and choose the ‘Export’ option from the drop sown menu that appears. Select the ‘Export As’ option from the ‘Export’ popup menu.</p>
<p>For an older Photoshop version, hit the ‘Export’ tab and choose ‘Save for Web’ from the dropdown menu, followed by selecting the PNG24 option. A format dialog box appears where you can set the transparency settings. To do this, navigate to ‘File Settings’ at the right, choose the PNG file format and check the ‘Transparency’ box. Avoid checking the ‘Smaller Size’ box, else the image will get saved in the PNG8 format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-16.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Export Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In the left of the screen, the image file size is displayed. Maintain an affordable file size, preferably within 200 KB, to avoid slower image loading on the sharing platform. You can adjust this in the ‘Image Size’ option at the right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-17.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Transparency and Size Settings Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Set a conveniently reduced dimension, while taking care not to set an extremely small size, else it will produce a pixelated output on the site. It is preferable to set a 50-100% larger image size for a convenient display across different devices.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Final Save</strong></p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with all the image settings, tap ‘Export All’ to save your artwork locally in your device. In the ‘File Save’ dialog box, choose a preferred device location, enter a suitable file name and choose the .png extension. At last, click on ‘Save’.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-Transparent-PNG-Background-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-Transparent-PNG-Background-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is a Transparent PNG Background?"></a>Part 1 What Is a Transparent PNG Background?</h2><p>Transparent backgrounds are essentially faded overlays to any graphic content, like, an image or a video, that are useful in emphasizing the main element in the substance. Compatible to a variety of image and video formats, these are the talk of the trend, owing to their excellent content promotion utility. These are the latest and creative examples of information presentation, along with being among the best branding tools that can potentially make your content fresh and unique.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF-2"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF"></a>Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF</h2><p>Diversity in requirement and usage has led to the advent of a variety of image formats, each suited to a specific purpose. On account of this variation, it becomes a confusing task to select the best image format that can fetch the most affordable images results in cohesion with exact user needs.</p>
<p>It is recommenced to use the JPG image format for natural stills that have a smooth variations in intensity and color. If your content requires image transparency, or contains texts and elements that have a sharp contrast image, like a brand logo, you should ideally prefer the PNG image format, while the GIF format is best suited for presenting animated content. As an explanation to the above usage constraints, here’s a comparison of the popular PNG, JPG and GIF image formats in the light of some common credibility parameters.</p>
<h3 id="01Compression-2"><a href="#01Compression-2" class="headerlink" title="01Compression"></a>01Compression</h3><p>Image compression facilitates a quick data transmission across different web based platforms, owing to the reduced file size. While compression can be either lossy or lossless, choose an image format that maintains the size credibility in resonance with your data needs. A lossless compression guarantees the retrieval of original image, but a lossy compression fails to do so.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format is a lossy compressor that plays on your ability to perceive. The format has the credibility of a 1:10 compression ratio, without comprising with the original image quality. However, a further increased compression ratio may generate perceivable differences in image quality.</p>
<p>The JPG compression utilizes the concept of Discrete Cosine Transform, i.e., a color averaging of the image pixels in close proximity. Hence, it is suitable to use this format for natural and scenic stills, having a smooth color and intensity transition. Preferring this image format for a transmission of high contrast and sharpened images is however, not advisable.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>This format supports the Deflate Compression technique and neither introduces artefacts, nor cuts down on the image quality. Choose the PNG image format for a lossless and high quality compression in comparison to JPG. This one is a more effective format with higher image quality, sharper image presentation and occupies a larger memory space on your device.</p>
<p>You can rely on PNG images for presenting data with text, shapes and logos with high contrast pixelation. It is however, not a good choice for transferring digital images that have a high resolution.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>Working on the LZW Compression Algorithm, this image format was originally used to showcase simple website graphics, when the PNG format was still at a developing stage. However, with the advancement of PNG as a more effective compression format, the use of GIF is now restricted to animated content sharing.</p>
<h3 id="02Transparency-2"><a href="#02Transparency-2" class="headerlink" title="02Transparency"></a>02Transparency</h3><p>Transparency is tern used to describe some invisible content. This is suitable to use in image backgrounds when you need to lay extra stress on the main content, like the logo of your product with a cohesive brand text, etc. the transparent background used here facilitates the use of a particular image with a series of background and color variations.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format has a limitation of not being compatible with image transparency, and hence is not suitable for related applications.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The PNG format gives you the liberty to use image transparency in two selective ways. You can either choose to make your image partially transparent by an alpha channel insertion for a smooth edge-background blend, or use index transparency to make the pixels of any particular color as transparent. PNG8 AND PNG24 versions of the format are supportive of index and alpha channel transparencies respectively.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>This format inherently supports index transparency and declares a chosen color on the palette as transparent. Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.</p>
<p>While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.</p>
<h3 id="03Color-2"><a href="#03Color-2" class="headerlink" title="03Color"></a>03Color</h3><p>Color is a visibly strong parameter of difference among the JPG, PNG and GIF image formats, with each one supporting as specific number of colors on the palette.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The color palette of JPG images is a huge inventory of 16 million colors, rendering them suitable for storing natural stills having a smooth color transition.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The two versions of PNG format differ on color variance. While PNG8 permits 256 colors, the PNG24 format supports 16 million colors, similar to the JPG format. Consider using the PNG8 format for an image with simple shapes and lesser variations in color. It is, on the other hand better to use the PNG24 format for images with transparent backgrounds, high image quality and complex shapes with detailed edges.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>The GIF format is a host to 256 colors, one of which becomes transparent on using index transparency and the other 255 support different color variations.</p>
<h3 id="04Animation-2"><a href="#04Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="04Animation"></a>04Animation</h3><p>Animation here, is not necessarily restricted to having frame rates, but refers to a certain periodic movement of specific image sections with time. Out of JPG, PNG and GIF, only the last one is compatible with GIFs. You can use this utility to crate and share eye catching banners and advertisements. The advent of GIF specific content platforms, such as, GIPHY, Tumblr, etc., has further uplifted GIF reach and usage.</p>
<p>A variety of image formats are available to choose from for catering to specific content requirements. However, you can always optimize the format selection in cohesion with the current need.</p>

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download Adobe Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to Adobe’s official website and download the Photoshop application in your device. Install and launch the same to reach the app’s welcome interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Inage Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a Layered Image File</strong></p>
<p>In the main interface, open a selected image and navigate to the ‘Layers Panel’ in the right of the image window. However, if the ‘Layers Panel’ does not show up by default, reach to the top toolbar and hit the ‘Window’ tab. From the drop sown menu that follows, select ‘Layers’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>In this panel, double tap the ‘Background‘layer. This causes the ‘Rename Layer’ dialog box to appear. You can either enter a suitable name or continue with the default ‘Layer 0’ name. When you are done, click on ‘OK’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Let’s Get Creating!</strong></p>
<p>In the application interface, navigate to the toolbar at the left and choose the ‘Magic Wand’ tool. Again, reach to the ‘Options’ bar at the top and choose ‘Select Subject’. This will facilitate the selection of the min object of the image, irrespective of its background and the selection will be visible as ‘marching ants’ around the object.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-12.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Magic Wand Tool Selection"
                ></p>
<p>If you find the selection to be improper, use the ‘Magic Wand’ to ward off excessive background portions by choosing the ’Subtract From Selection’ option, or even add some extra product portions, suited to your requirement. While making your selection, take care to include any holes in the product image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Subject Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Background Deletion</strong></p>
<p>When you are left with only the selected product, navigate to the top toolbar and hit the ’Select’ tab and choose ‘Inverse’ from the drop down menu that follows. You can alternatively use the ‘Shift+Ctrl+I’ command for a Windows device, or enter ‘Shift+Command+I’ command, in case you are using a Mac supported device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-14.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application-Background Inverse Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Make a selection of the inverse background and tap ‘Backspace’ or ‘Delete’ in your Windows and Mac devices respectively. This will cause your background to get transparent. In the Photoshop application, a gray-white checkerboard represents a transparent background.</p>
<p>In case you require deselecting any selection, enter ‘Ctrl+D’ in Windows or ‘Command+D’ in a Mac device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-15.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Section Deselect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save Your Creation in a Web Compatible Format</strong></p>
<p>When you are done creating the transparent background artwork, it becomes equally important to save your creation in a web compatible format to export them on different media platforms and product websites.</p>
<p>Talking of the preferable image format, it is highly recommended to use the PNG24 one, owing to its flexibility of alpha channel transparency, which permits partially transparent image backgrounds along with layered transparency. This in turn makes it possible to integrate the image with varying color backgrounds on different sites and platforms without hollow pixelation.</p>
<p>To save your artwork in the PNG24 file format, navigate to the application toolbar bat the top and hit the ‘File’ tab and choose the ‘Export’ option from the drop sown menu that appears. Select the ‘Export As’ option from the ‘Export’ popup menu.</p>
<p>For an older Photoshop version, hit the ‘Export’ tab and choose ‘Save for Web’ from the dropdown menu, followed by selecting the PNG24 option. A format dialog box appears where you can set the transparency settings. To do this, navigate to ‘File Settings’ at the right, choose the PNG file format and check the ‘Transparency’ box. Avoid checking the ‘Smaller Size’ box, else the image will get saved in the PNG8 format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-16.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Export Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In the left of the screen, the image file size is displayed. Maintain an affordable file size, preferably within 200 KB, to avoid slower image loading on the sharing platform. You can adjust this in the ‘Image Size’ option at the right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-17.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Transparency and Size Settings Interface"

Compatible to a variety of image and video formats, these are the talk of the trend, owing to their excellent content promotion utility. These are the latest and creative examples of information presentation, along with being among the best branding tools that can potentially make your content fresh and unique.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF-3"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF"></a>Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF</h2><p>Diversity in requirement and usage has led to the advent of a variety of image formats, each suited to a specific purpose. On account of this variation, it becomes a confusing task to select the best image format that can fetch the most affordable images results in cohesion with exact user needs.</p>
<p>It is recommenced to use the JPG image format for natural stills that have a smooth variations in intensity and color. If your content requires image transparency, or contains texts and elements that have a sharp contrast image, like a brand logo, you should ideally prefer the PNG image format, while the GIF format is best suited for presenting animated content. As an explanation to the above usage constraints, here’s a comparison of the popular PNG, JPG and GIF image formats in the light of some common credibility parameters.</p>
<h3 id="01Compression-3"><a href="#01Compression-3" class="headerlink" title="01Compression"></a>01Compression</h3><p>Image compression facilitates a quick data transmission across different web based platforms, owing to the reduced file size. While compression can be either lossy or lossless, choose an image format that maintains the size credibility in resonance with your data needs. A lossless compression guarantees the retrieval of original image, but a lossy compression fails to do so.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format is a lossy compressor that plays on your ability to perceive. The format has the credibility of a 1:10 compression ratio, without comprising with the original image quality. However, a further increased compression ratio may generate perceivable differences in image quality.</p>
<p>The JPG compression utilizes the concept of Discrete Cosine Transform, i.e., a color averaging of the image pixels in close proximity. Hence, it is suitable to use this format for natural and scenic stills, having a smooth color and intensity transition. Preferring this image format for a transmission of high contrast and sharpened images is however, not advisable.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>This format supports the Deflate Compression technique and neither introduces artefacts, nor cuts down on the image quality. Choose the PNG image format for a lossless and high quality compression in comparison to JPG. This one is a more effective format with higher image quality, sharper image presentation and occupies a larger memory space on your device.</p>
<p>You can rely on PNG images for presenting data with text, shapes and logos with high contrast pixelation. It is however, not a good choice for transferring digital images that have a high resolution.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>Working on the LZW Compression Algorithm, this image format was originally used to showcase simple website graphics, when the PNG format was still at a developing stage. However, with the advancement of PNG as a more effective compression format, the use of GIF is now restricted to animated content sharing.</p>
<h3 id="02Transparency-3"><a href="#02Transparency-3" class="headerlink" title="02Transparency"></a>02Transparency</h3><p>Transparency is tern used to describe some invisible content. This is suitable to use in image backgrounds when you need to lay extra stress on the main content, like the logo of your product with a cohesive brand text, etc. the transparent background used here facilitates the use of a particular image with a series of background and color variations.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format has a limitation of not being compatible with image transparency, and hence is not suitable for related applications.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The PNG format gives you the liberty to use image transparency in two selective ways. You can either choose to make your image partially transparent by an alpha channel insertion for a smooth edge-background blend, or use index transparency to make the pixels of any particular color as transparent. PNG8 AND PNG24 versions of the format are supportive of index and alpha channel transparencies respectively.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>This format inherently supports index transparency and declares a chosen color on the palette as transparent. Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.</p>
<p>While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.</p>
<h3 id="03Color-3"><a href="#03Color-3" class="headerlink" title="03Color"></a>03Color</h3><p>Color is a visibly strong parameter of difference among the JPG, PNG and GIF image formats, with each one supporting as specific number of colors on the palette.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The color palette of JPG images is a huge inventory of 16 million colors, rendering them suitable for storing natural stills having a smooth color transition.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The two versions of PNG format differ on color variance. While PNG8 permits 256 colors, the PNG24 format supports 16 million colors, similar to the JPG format. Consider using the PNG8 format for an image with simple shapes and lesser variations in color. It is, on the other hand better to use the PNG24 format for images with transparent backgrounds, high image quality and complex shapes with detailed edges.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>The GIF format is a host to 256 colors, one of which becomes transparent on using index transparency and the other 255 support different color variations.</p>
<h3 id="04Animation-3"><a href="#04Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="04Animation"></a>04Animation</h3><p>Animation here, is not necessarily restricted to having frame rates, but refers to a certain periodic movement of specific image sections with time. Out of JPG, PNG and GIF, only the last one is compatible with GIFs. You can use this utility to crate and share eye catching banners and advertisements. The advent of GIF specific content platforms, such as, GIPHY, Tumblr, etc., has further uplifted GIF reach and usage.</p>
<p>A variety of image formats are available to choose from for catering to specific content requirements. However, you can always optimize the format selection in cohesion with the current need.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Let’s Get Creating!</strong></p>
<p>In the application interface, navigate to the toolbar at the left and choose the ‘Magic Wand’ tool. Again, reach to the ‘Options’ bar at the top and choose ‘Select Subject’. This will facilitate the selection of the min object of the image, irrespective of its background and the selection will be visible as ‘marching ants’ around the object.</p>

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Magic Wand Tool Selection"
                ></p>
<p>If you find the selection to be improper, use the ‘Magic Wand’ to ward off excessive background portions by choosing the ’Subtract From Selection’ option, or even add some extra product portions, suited to your requirement. While making your selection, take care to include any holes in the product image.</p>

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Subject Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Background Deletion</strong></p>
<p>When you are left with only the selected product, navigate to the top toolbar and hit the ’Select’ tab and choose ‘Inverse’ from the drop down menu that follows. You can alternatively use the ‘Shift+Ctrl+I’ command for a Windows device, or enter ‘Shift+Command+I’ command, in case you are using a Mac supported device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-14.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application-Background Inverse Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Make a selection of the inverse background and tap ‘Backspace’ or ‘Delete’ in your Windows and Mac devices respectively. This will cause your background to get transparent. In the Photoshop application, a gray-white checkerboard represents a transparent background.</p>
<p>In case you require deselecting any selection, enter ‘Ctrl+D’ in Windows or ‘Command+D’ in a Mac device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-15.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Section Deselect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save Your Creation in a Web Compatible Format</strong></p>
<p>When you are done creating the transparent background artwork, it becomes equally important to save your creation in a web compatible format to export them on different media platforms and product websites.</p>
<p>Talking of the preferable image format, it is highly recommended to use the PNG24 one, owing to its flexibility of alpha channel transparency, which permits partially transparent image backgrounds along with layered transparency. This in turn makes it possible to integrate the image with varying color backgrounds on different sites and platforms without hollow pixelation.</p>
<p>To save your artwork in the PNG24 file format, navigate to the application toolbar bat the top and hit the ‘File’ tab and choose the ‘Export’ option from the drop sown menu that appears. Select the ‘Export As’ option from the ‘Export’ popup menu.</p>
<p>For an older Photoshop version, hit the ‘Export’ tab and choose ‘Save for Web’ from the dropdown menu, followed by selecting the PNG24 option. A format dialog box appears where you can set the transparency settings. To do this, navigate to ‘File Settings’ at the right, choose the PNG file format and check the ‘Transparency’ box. Avoid checking the ‘Smaller Size’ box, else the image will get saved in the PNG8 format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-16.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Export Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In the left of the screen, the image file size is displayed. Maintain an affordable file size, preferably within 200 KB, to avoid slower image loading on the sharing platform. You can adjust this in the ‘Image Size’ option at the right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-17.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Transparency and Size Settings Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Set a conveniently reduced dimension, while taking care not to set an extremely small size, else it will produce a pixelated output on the site. It is preferable to set a 50-100% larger image size for a convenient display across different devices.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Final Save</strong></p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with all the image settings, tap ‘Export All’ to save your artwork locally in your device. In the ‘File Save’ dialog box, choose a preferred device location, enter a suitable file name and choose the .png extension. At last, click on ‘Save’.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Import Media File</strong></p>
<p>Launch the app to reach the main interface, where you will find the ‘Import’ tab. Hit it and choose ‘Import Media File’ from the drop down menu that follows. This will upload your selected image to the software’s media library.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Timeline Dragging</strong></p>
<p>You now need to insert the selected image from Filmora’s media library to the software’s editing timeline. You can do this either by right clicking the selected image, followed by choosing the ‘Insert’ option, or a simple ’Drag and Drop’ method.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>

It’s the only way to highlight important aspects of sports and action scenes. Recording in slow motion is not difficult when you will learn <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>how to record slow-motion video</strong></a>. Before learning, let’s understand important aspects you should look at while recording.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> For slow-motion video, choosing the right frame rate is crucial. A higher framerate, such as 120fps and 240fps, allows smoother playback. So, before recording, ensure that your camera supports a good framerate.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Maintaining high-resolution videos is important to get good quality. Usually, slow-motion footage uses 4K and HD (High Definition) resolution. Having a high video resolution means providing clarity in details in videos.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> It refers to the speed at which the camera closes and controls exposure. Adjust the shutter speed to faster mode to capture every crisp in slow motion. It will prevent motion blur and help in freezing fast-moving objects.</li>
<li><strong>Audio Consideration:</strong> You should know that recording slow motion will affect the original audio. Meanwhile, some cameras preserve the original sound. So, be prepared and test your camera’s audio speed to ease the editing process.</li>
<li><strong>Focus and Stability:</strong> Minimize your camera shake and enable a stabilizer or tripod. Stable footage is essential to enhance the video quality. Moreover, try to keep your main subject in camera focus. In this regard, you can use manual focus control if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Editing Software Compatibility:</strong> Another thing that you must consider is tool compatibility. It’s better to check it before recording so you will not regret it later. Check your editing tools are supporting the file format of the recorded slow-motion video.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong> The <strong>“</strong>No More Storage” sign is a nightmare when you have recorded a perfect shot. Slow-motion videos consume large storage because of high resolution and frame rate. Thus, consider this aspect before recording to avoid inconvenience and arrange storage media.</li>
</ul>

It’s the only way to highlight important aspects of sports and action scenes. Recording in slow motion is not difficult when you will learn <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>how to record slow-motion video</strong></a>. Before learning, let’s understand important aspects you should look at while recording.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> For slow-motion video, choosing the right frame rate is crucial. A higher framerate, such as 120fps and 240fps, allows smoother playback. So, before recording, ensure that your camera supports a good framerate.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Maintaining high-resolution videos is important to get good quality. Usually, slow-motion footage uses 4K and HD (High Definition) resolution. Having a high video resolution means providing clarity in details in videos.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> It refers to the speed at which the camera closes and controls exposure. Adjust the shutter speed to faster mode to capture every crisp in slow motion. It will prevent motion blur and help in freezing fast-moving objects.</li>
<li><strong>Audio Consideration:</strong> You should know that recording slow motion will affect the original audio. Meanwhile, some cameras preserve the original sound. So, be prepared and test your camera’s audio speed to ease the editing process.</li>
<li><strong>Focus and Stability:</strong> Minimize your camera shake and enable a stabilizer or tripod. Stable footage is essential to enhance the video quality. Moreover, try to keep your main subject in camera focus. In this regard, you can use manual focus control if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Editing Software Compatibility:</strong> Another thing that you must consider is tool compatibility. It’s better to check it before recording so you will not regret it later. Check your editing tools are supporting the file format of the recorded slow-motion video.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong> The <strong>“</strong>No More Storage” sign is a nightmare when you have recorded a perfect shot. Slow-motion videos consume large storage because of high resolution and frame rate. Thus, consider this aspect before recording to avoid inconvenience and arrange storage media.</li>
</ul>

A phenomenon that arises here is, can we slow down the normally recorded video? The simple answer is yes. There are many editing apps designed for this purpose. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one such editing app to slow down the pre-recorded videos.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-5"><a href="#Step-1-5" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Access your Adobe Premiere Pro application and import a video in the timeline. Identify the frame rate of your video clip for a non-choppy playback.</p>

It hides and distracts from the main subject at hand. You can use various photo editing tools to remove the background from PNG images or JPG. However, they may not do the job as easily as you are thinking.</p>
<p>Yes, we know that you may be wondering about Adobe Photoshop now. It can be used for removing the background too but are you ready to pay for it? No, right? This is when you can depend on PowerPoint to erase the background of a photo without any hassle. Make sure you have PowerPoint 2010 or a later version installed before beginning. Because the earlier Microsoft PowerPoint versions don’t have a background removal feature.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the image in a new tab</p>
<p>Launch PowerPoint on your desktop or Mac and change the layout of the slide to “Blank”. Next, insert your image, which has a solid or high-contrast background. Such pictures are easier to transform and edit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import picture powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Select the “Remove Background” option</p>
<p>Click on your image to get the “Picture Format” in the menu toolbar. On the left top side, choose the “Remove Background” option. Now, PowerPoint will try to remove the background automatically. If the final picture that you are getting is not satisfactory, move to the next step.</p>

                      alt="click remove background powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Select the Area</p>
<p>From the given options in the toolbar, mark the areas that you want to keep or remove in the final result. As you can view, how some parts of the pictures have been cut. So, spread the box to cover the entire area of the image, which you want to keep. Remember, purple-highlighted areas are removed automatically.</p>

These signs are useful for getting a precise image at the end. The Minus sign allows you to mark the areas to be removed. The plus sign can be used to keep the marked areas in the final picture.</p>
<p>Step 4: Finishing Touches</p>
<p>Check your image carefully and see whether any area is left to be removed or not. You can zoom in to find the tiniest spot. When you are satisfied with every detail, click anywhere outside of the image to stop further edits. Congratulations! Your transparent PNG is ready to save. Go to “File”&gt;”Save As” and find the option to save your picture in PNG transparent format.</p>

It’s possible with transparent PNG images only. The transparent PNG images format contains superior quality and no background. Hence, it is pretty helpful for the designers to add them to graphics and videos.</p>
<p>In case you have some JPG images but you want it in PNG images format, don’t worry. You can use Kapwing as it’s a trusted content creation and video editing platform.

<p>Step 2: Pick a Tool</p>
<p>After the image upload finishes, the next thing is to start removing its background. Go to the right side of the “Image” tab and click on the “Erase” button. Otherwise, you can use the “Remove Background from Image” tool to start.</p>

<p>Apart from that, the Magic Wand tool is amazing for removing a particular area at once. You can remove the picture background in less time and effort. If you want to remove a certain area of the same color, then the Magic Wand is the best tool to use. It eliminates similar groups of pixels together. To modify the sensitivity, move the same dial to the right as you did while selecting the “Erase” tool.</p>
<p>For some impressive results, adjust the zoom and choose “Move” to select the pixels you want to remove.</p>
<p>Step 3: Make the PNG and Download</p>
<p>After everything has been set, it’s time to download your PNG transparent file. Click “Done” and then move back to the Kapwing Studio for additional features.

If you want to remove a certain area of the same color, then the Magic Wand is the best tool to use. It eliminates similar groups of pixels together. To modify the sensitivity, move the same dial to the right as you did while selecting the “Erase” tool.</p>
<p>For some impressive results, adjust the zoom and choose “Move” to select the pixels you want to remove.</p>
<p>Step 3: Make the PNG and Download</p>
<p>After everything has been set, it’s time to download your PNG transparent file. Click “Done” and then move back to the Kapwing Studio for additional features.

<p>Yes, we know that you may be wondering about Adobe Photoshop now. It can be used for removing the background too but are you ready to pay for it? No, right? This is when you can depend on PowerPoint to erase the background of a photo without any hassle. Make sure you have PowerPoint 2010 or a later version installed before beginning.

<h2 id="●-Ending-Thoughts-→-7"><a href="#●-Ending-Thoughts-→-7" class="headerlink" title="● Ending Thoughts →"></a><strong>●</strong> Ending Thoughts <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> So there you have it: the full story on transparent PNGs, removing background, and conversion from JPG to PNG file format. As you can see, it’s not too hard to combine one image in your design. However, we don’t want you to forget anything. Hence, remember these things when you try to convert JPG to PNG transparent.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Whichever method you choose to turn a PNG image into a JPG, make sure you are familiar with the tool. If not, first spend time figuring out the features. Seek out what suits you and then start. We would recommend following the above tips carefully instead of using any other tool.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Beware of using third-party websites for background removal from a PNG. Many will store your pictures, which can be accessed by other users. They are not safe for you by any means.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It’s not an easy job to convert JPG to transparent PNG using PowerPoint, especially when an image contains multiple images and colors. For such pictures, you can use Kapwing. It has plenty of additional features that you can use for creative work.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you have any questions or have different ways of accomplishing this, feel free to comment below. Thanks for reading.</p>

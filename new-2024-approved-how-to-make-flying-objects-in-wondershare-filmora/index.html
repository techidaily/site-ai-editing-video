What will you need to make a flying object?"></a>Part 1. What will you need to make a flying object?</h2><p>This is not witchcraft, so we will abstain from using potions and herbs. Instead, to fly objects in our videos, we will use simple techniques that you may also be familiar with.</p>

This video camera can now be from a mobile phone or a high-quality DSLR. It will all depend upon your preference for quality and frame rate.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Stability is the key here, as the captured videos will be masked and combined in the later stages of the steps. To do so, consistently capturing the video in the same ratio is necessary. You can stabilize the video with a simple gorilla pod that you can get of good quality or a simple tripod.</p>
<h3 id="The-prop"><a href="#The-prop" class="headerlink" title="The prop"></a>The prop</h3><p>The prop will be the object that we will be flying in the video. It could be a fluffy toy, a ball, a box, or anything you desire to be flying in your video.</p>

<h3 id="Good-presentation"><a href="#Good-presentation" class="headerlink" title="Good presentation"></a>Good presentation</h3><p>Now, if you want your video to shine like the good ones, you will need to know how to present it. In this section, the requirement will be yourself. As you are not flying an object, you must act the part.</p>
<p>A good presentation will allow you to make the video more natural. Because no matter how skilled you are with video editing, a video with props will only be of quality until the subject acts their part with quality.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-capture-the-footage"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-capture-the-footage" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to capture the footage?"></a>Part 2. How to capture the footage?</h2><p>Before we get into how we edit our footage, we need to know how to shoot the video to edit. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set up</strong> your camera on a tripod or a gorilla pod.</li>
<li>After setting up the camera, <strong>record</strong> an empty frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An empty frame video will be the one you will use to mask the original clip.</p>
<h3 id="Reference-video"><a href="#Reference-video" class="headerlink" title="Reference video"></a>Reference video</h3><p>Start recording a five-second clip of the sofa where you will be sitting without yourself or the prop. Here you don’t need to add anything except the reference. Follow the guidelines below when making the reference video:</p>
<ul>
<li>The video should be plain.</li>
<li>It should be simple.</li>
<li>There should be no moving object or subject.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/reference-video.gif"
                      alt="reference video"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Main-video"><a href="#Main-video" class="headerlink" title="Main video"></a>Main video</h3><p>After shooting the empty frame video, move on to shooting the video with yourself in it. Follow the below to achieve something unique:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your focus should be on the prop.</li>
<li>Use a thread or a rope to attach the prop to it. (In this case, we are using a ball.)</li>
<li>Attach the ball to the thread and hand it on the roof.</li>
<li>Record yourself now with the prop with your desired content or script.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/main-video.gif"
                      alt="main video"
                ></p>
<p>After completing the video, simply stop recording. Now you will end up with two video clips.</p>
<p>Adding these two clips in the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can easily create the flying object effect. To do so, follow the steps explained in the section ahead.</p>

<li>Open the Wondershare Filmora software and Click on the New Project icon on the window.</li>
<li>After you have clicked on the New Project icon, our main workplace will be launched.</li>

<ul>
<li>Simply click on the imported clips on the import window.</li>
<li>Then drag it to the timeline below.</li>
<li>Doing so will create a working timeline you can view and edit as you go along the editing process.</li>
</ul>

You will need to size it to the original video for that to work. Doing so is simple and will require you to take some easy steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, click on the clip.</li>
<li>Then, when it is selected, move on to the tab above to choose the speed option from the bar.</li>
<li>Here, you will also see options such as cropping, Green screen, and color.</li>
<li>Choose the option of speed.</li>
<li>Then, a drop-down tile will pop up. Here you can see different options available to speed up your video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<ul>
<li>You can speed up your video and slow it down.</li>
<li>For now, we will have to slow it down.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Slowing it down will increase the time of the video clip and allow you to match it with the original video clip.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about the speed, as the video is already empty, and there will be no distractions to disturb our editing.</p>
<h5 id="Step4Add-the-masking-effect"><a href="#Step4Add-the-masking-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step4Add the masking effect"></a>Step4Add the masking effect</h5><p>Now that we have our video aligned with the reference video we are using. Let’s move to the next step.</p>
<p>This step will try to remove the thread attached to the ball; otherwise, it will show in the video, and our effect will be ruined. However, before we do that, we will need to know what <strong>masking</strong> is.</p>
<h5 id="What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?</h5><p>Have you ever seen the behind-the-scenes of those big-budget movies? Then you might have seen the actors and the stunt workers hanging from big ropes performing stunts in front of green screens.</p>
<p>Well, the directors capture the video in real-time. But they can do those big stunts on TV with editing and CGI, and one of the effects is “<strong>Masking</strong>.”</p>
<p>The masking effect allows you to mask the object on the screen with a reference video. So that’s how the ropes attached to the stuntmen get removed in the original videos.</p>
<h5 id="How-to-add-a-masking-effect"><a href="#How-to-add-a-masking-effect" class="headerlink" title="How to add a masking effect?"></a>How to add a masking effect?</h5><p>Although there are numerous ways to do that, the one we will use in this video is to remove the thread. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply go to the <strong>effect icon</strong> that you can see in the bar above.</li>
<li>In the effects bar, move to the utility tab.</li>
<li>You will see a window showing you the many effects Wondershare Filmora provides you from default.</li>
<li>Select the shape mask tile.</li>
<li>Now drag and drop it on the timeline below.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must ensure the effect is applied to the main video, not the reference video.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you drag the effect into the main video, you will notice a transparent shape added to the video. This is your <strong>Mask</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step5Edit-the-masking-effect"><a href="#Step5Edit-the-masking-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step5Edit the masking effect"></a>Step5Edit the masking effect</h5><p>You must hide the thread attached to the ball with the masking effect. To do this, follow the below guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the effect added to the main video.</li>
<li>You will notice another window pop up on the import library.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the pop-up window, you will see the multiple options and edits you can apply to the masking effect, such as Transform, Compositing, Motion tracking, and stabilization.</p>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Scroll down on the window and notice a video <strong>effect tab</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the effect tab, you will have multiple options, such as the shape mask, X, Y, and scale and blur strength options, as shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now adjust the mask to hide the string. It may be easy to invert the mask.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> That the borders of the mask are blurred. But you can also change them by inverting the mask, which turns the borders and the space between them.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong> the invisibility cloak from Harry Potter? It works just like that, only with a solid shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now use the <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y options</strong> to move the mask anywhere in the video.</li>
</ul>

You can create the pop-up effect in simple and easy steps, as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, drag the timeline dragger to the point where you want the prop or the ball to pop up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your presentation should be accurate and precise!</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you were doing a “<strong>swoosh</strong>“ action, similar to swinging a wand. Now you want your object to appear at that time.</p>
<p><strong>Split the Video:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the timeline dragger to that point.</li>
<li>Now press <strong>Ctrl+B</strong> to split both videos.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Popup Effect:</strong></p>
<p>The masking effect will be applied from the start. Our goal is to hide the masking effect before the ball pop-ups. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the setting by <strong>Double-Clicking</strong> the masking effect on the original video.</li>
<li>Then <strong>move</strong> the mask over the ball instead of on the thread. Doing so would make the ball disappear.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Final Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lastly, click on <strong>Ok</strong> when done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Play the clip from the start, and you will notice the ball popping up according to your action.</p>

<h3 id="Good-presentation-1"><a href="#Good-presentation-1" class="headerlink" title="Good presentation"></a>Good presentation</h3><p>Now, if you want your video to shine like the good ones, you will need to know how to present it. In this section, the requirement will be yourself. As you are not flying an object, you must act the part.</p>
<p>A good presentation will allow you to make the video more natural. Because no matter how skilled you are with video editing, a video with props will only be of quality until the subject acts their part with quality.</p>

How to capture the footage?</h2><p>Before we get into how we edit our footage, we need to know how to shoot the video to edit. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set up</strong> your camera on a tripod or a gorilla pod.</li>
<li>After setting up the camera, <strong>record</strong> an empty frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An empty frame video will be the one you will use to mask the original clip.</p>
<h3 id="Reference-video-1"><a href="#Reference-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Reference video"></a>Reference video</h3><p>Start recording a five-second clip of the sofa where you will be sitting without yourself or the prop. Here you don’t need to add anything except the reference. Follow the guidelines below when making the reference video:</p>
<ul>
<li>The video should be plain.</li>
<li>It should be simple.</li>
<li>There should be no moving object or subject.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/reference-video.gif"
                      alt="reference video"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Main-video-1"><a href="#Main-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Main video"></a>Main video</h3><p>After shooting the empty frame video, move on to shooting the video with yourself in it. Follow the below to achieve something unique:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your focus should be on the prop.</li>
<li>Use a thread or a rope to attach the prop to it. (In this case, we are using a ball.)</li>
<li>Attach the ball to the thread and hand it on the roof.</li>
<li>Record yourself now with the prop with your desired content or script.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="main video"
                ></p>
<p>After completing the video, simply stop recording. Now you will end up with two video clips.</p>
<p>Adding these two clips in the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can easily create the flying object effect. To do so, follow the steps explained in the section ahead.</p>

<ul>
<li>Simply click on the imported clips on the import window.</li>
<li>Then drag it to the timeline below.</li>
<li>Doing so will create a working timeline you can view and edit as you go along the editing process.</li>
</ul>

You will need to size it to the original video for that to work. Doing so is simple and will require you to take some easy steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, click on the clip.</li>
<li>Then, when it is selected, move on to the tab above to choose the speed option from the bar.</li>
<li>Here, you will also see options such as cropping, Green screen, and color.</li>
<li>Choose the option of speed.</li>
<li>Then, a drop-down tile will pop up. Here you can see different options available to speed up your video.</li>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Slowing it down will increase the time of the video clip and allow you to match it with the original video clip.</p>

<p>This step will try to remove the thread attached to the ball; otherwise, it will show in the video, and our effect will be ruined. However, before we do that, we will need to know what <strong>masking</strong> is.</p>
<h5 id="What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?</h5><p>Have you ever seen the behind-the-scenes of those big-budget movies? Then you might have seen the actors and the stunt workers hanging from big ropes performing stunts in front of green screens.</p>
<p>Well, the directors capture the video in real-time. But they can do those big stunts on TV with editing and CGI, and one of the effects is “<strong>Masking</strong>.”</p>
<p>The masking effect allows you to mask the object on the screen with a reference video. So that’s how the ropes attached to the stuntmen get removed in the original videos.</p>
<h5 id="How-to-add-a-masking-effect-1"><a href="#How-to-add-a-masking-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="How to add a masking effect?"></a>How to add a masking effect?</h5><p>Although there are numerous ways to do that, the one we will use in this video is to remove the thread. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply go to the <strong>effect icon</strong> that you can see in the bar above.</li>
<li>In the effects bar, move to the utility tab.</li>
<li>You will see a window showing you the many effects Wondershare Filmora provides you from default.</li>
<li>Select the shape mask tile.</li>
<li>Now drag and drop it on the timeline below.</li>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must ensure the effect is applied to the main video, not the reference video.</p>

</ul>
<p>In the effect tab, you will have multiple options, such as the shape mask, X, Y, and scale and blur strength options, as shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now adjust the mask to hide the string. It may be easy to invert the mask.</li>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> That the borders of the mask are blurred. But you can also change them by inverting the mask, which turns the borders and the space between them.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong> the invisibility cloak from Harry Potter? It works just like that, only with a solid shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now use the <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y options</strong> to move the mask anywhere in the video.</li>

You can create the pop-up effect in simple and easy steps, as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, drag the timeline dragger to the point where you want the prop or the ball to pop up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your presentation should be accurate and precise!</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you were doing a “<strong>swoosh</strong>“ action, similar to swinging a wand. Now you want your object to appear at that time.</p>
<p><strong>Split the Video:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the timeline dragger to that point.</li>
<li>Now press <strong>Ctrl+B</strong> to split both videos.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Popup Effect:</strong></p>
<p>The masking effect will be applied from the start. Our goal is to hide the masking effect before the ball pop-ups. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the setting by <strong>Double-Clicking</strong> the masking effect on the original video.</li>
<li>Then <strong>move</strong> the mask over the ball instead of on the thread. Doing so would make the ball disappear.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Final Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lastly, click on <strong>Ok</strong> when done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Play the clip from the start, and you will notice the ball popping up according to your action.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

                      alt="online-mp4-cropper"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Capable of cropping various types of videos including MP4, WebM, AVI and many more. This means that it can also output different formats and encoding. This article may seem to focus on mp4 format but if in the future that you would need a different format then this may come in handy.</li>
<li>The power to set the cropping size and ratio more effectively. There are also presets available to help you transform it into video square, 4:3, 16:9, 3:2 and many more. Having a cropping area that you can easily adjust is such a helpful feature.</li>
<li>It shows the display configuration info for imported mp4 video files.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum file size is only 100 mb (megabyte). Which means that you have to consider if your mp4 video file would not exceed this limit. A disadvantage indeed especially for those who have a video recorder that saves it in high quality. There is also a fear that the user would be hassled by trimming longer videos into shorter clips just to meet this requirement.</li>
<li>The video preview is not the same as the final output. The quality in the preview may be shown as having a much lower quality.</li>
<li>Other video file formats may not play due to incompatibility. This may be a huge disadvantage especially if you’re looking for efficiency in getting stuff done.</li>

<p>I have shown you the six best online mp4 croppers and each of its pros and cons. By now, you have an idea of which of these would suit you as a user.</p>
<p>The question is… are you aware of what you need or want for a mp4 video cropper? It’s time for you to weigh your own values and which mp4 cropper would fit that. Yes, you can read tons of reviews on the internet but if you don’t have self- awareness then you would still be confused on which would fit you.</p>
<p>There is no need to fear the unknown. A part of the process is exploring the possibilities and here we are demonstrating to you your 6 best choices to try from.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments about your thoughts on these tools. You could also make your own pros and cons of these mp4 video croppers.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Capable of cropping various types of videos including MP4, WebM, AVI and many more. This means that it can also output different formats and encoding. This article may seem to focus on mp4 format but if in the future that you would need a different format then this may come in handy.</li>
<li>The power to set the cropping size and ratio more effectively. There are also presets available to help you transform it into video square, 4:3, 16:9, 3:2 and many more. Having a cropping area that you can easily adjust is such a helpful feature.</li>
<li>It shows the display configuration info for imported mp4 video files.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum file size is only 100 mb (megabyte). Which means that you have to consider if your mp4 video file would not exceed this limit. A disadvantage indeed especially for those who have a video recorder that saves it in high quality. There is also a fear that the user would be hassled by trimming longer videos into shorter clips just to meet this requirement.</li>
<li>The video preview is not the same as the final output. The quality in the preview may be shown as having a much lower quality.</li>
<li>Other video file formats may not play due to incompatibility. This may be a huge disadvantage especially if you’re looking for efficiency in getting stuff done.</li>

<p>I have shown you the six best online mp4 croppers and each of its pros and cons. By now, you have an idea of which of these would suit you as a user.</p>
<p>The question is… are you aware of what you need or want for a mp4 video cropper? It’s time for you to weigh your own values and which mp4 cropper would fit that. Yes, you can read tons of reviews on the internet but if you don’t have self- awareness then you would still be confused on which would fit you.</p>
<p>There is no need to fear the unknown. A part of the process is exploring the possibilities and here we are demonstrating to you your 6 best choices to try from.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments about your thoughts on these tools. You could also make your own pros and cons of these mp4 video croppers.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Capable of cropping various types of videos including MP4, WebM, AVI and many more. This means that it can also output different formats and encoding. This article may seem to focus on mp4 format but if in the future that you would need a different format then this may come in handy.</li>
<li>The power to set the cropping size and ratio more effectively. There are also presets available to help you transform it into video square, 4:3, 16:9, 3:2 and many more. Having a cropping area that you can easily adjust is such a helpful feature.</li>
<li>It shows the display configuration info for imported mp4 video files.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum file size is only 100 mb (megabyte). Which means that you have to consider if your mp4 video file would not exceed this limit. A disadvantage indeed especially for those who have a video recorder that saves it in high quality. There is also a fear that the user would be hassled by trimming longer videos into shorter clips just to meet this requirement.</li>
<li>The video preview is not the same as the final output. The quality in the preview may be shown as having a much lower quality.</li>
<li>Other video file formats may not play due to incompatibility. This may be a huge disadvantage especially if you’re looking for efficiency in getting stuff done.</li>
</ul>

<p>The gaming world is ever-changing, with developers looking to create innovative ways to immerse players into their digital worlds. One such technology that has begun to sweep is <strong>AI in the game industry</strong>.</p>
<p>AI is a powerful tool in many ways to improve the gaming experience. It can make <strong>artificial intelligence in computer games</strong> more believable and add replayability and immersion to games, and we can expect to see even more impressive applications in the future.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-AI-in-Gaming"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-AI-in-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is AI in Gaming?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is AI in Gaming?</strong></h2><p>In simple terms, AI is a set of algorithms that allow a computer to learn and improve from experience. Although you can apply it in many ways, <strong>artificial intelligence in video games</strong> is usually helpful to create more intelligent and more believable non-player characters (NPCs).</p>
<p>For example, an AI system might be helpful to determine how an NPC reacts to the player’s actions. If the player tries to steal from an NPC, the AI might make the NPC angry and more likely to attack the player. Alternatively, if the player is friendly to an NPC, the <strong>AI game playing</strong> might make the NPC more likely to help the player in future interactions.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-AI-in-Gaming-Matter"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-AI-in-Gaming-Matter" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?"></a>Part 2 <strong>Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?</strong></h2><p>One of the most vital aspects of <strong>AI in video games</strong> is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players. When games can convincingly simulate human-like behavior, it can be a much more enjoyable experience for gamers. AI can make NPCs seem more lifelike and make the game world feel more believable.</p>
<p>AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets. For example, a game might use procedural generation to create random dungeons or quests that the player can explore. This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-AI-Will-Completely-Change-Video-Games"><a href="#Part-3-How-AI-Will-Completely-Change-Video-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How AI Will Completely Change Video Games"></a>Part 3 <strong>How AI Will Completely Change Video Games</strong></h2><p>It is not a secret that AI is changing the world as we know it. With its ability to enable computers to learn and improve from experience, AI is paving the way for a future where machines can handle more complex tasks. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of video gaming.</p>
<p>In the past, developers brought in AI primarily for simple things like making certain NPCs (non-player characters) move and act realistically. But now, <strong>artificial intelligence in video games</strong> is being used for much more complex tasks like generating procedural content and creating believable human-like behavior. This results in a new generation of <strong>AI game playing</strong> that are more immersive and playable.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Games-with-Incredible-Artificial-Intelligence"><a href="#Part-4-Games-with-Incredible-Artificial-Intelligence" class="headerlink" title="Part 4   Games with Incredible Artificial Intelligence"></a>Part 4   <strong>Games with Incredible Artificial Intelligence</strong></h2><p>Now, we will look into eight video games that signify why we need the <strong>best ai in video games.</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Fallout-4"><a href="#01Fallout-4" class="headerlink" title="01Fallout 4"></a>01<strong>Fallout 4</strong></h3><p>One of the most attractive examples of <strong>AI in video gaming</strong> is Fallout 4. This post-apocalyptic RPG features some of the most believable NPCs ever seen in a game. Each character is fully voiced, and they all have their unique personalities and backstories. The AI generates procedural content, meaning that the game world is always different each time you play.</p>

<p>The gaming world is ever-changing, with developers looking to create innovative ways to immerse players into their digital worlds. One such technology that has begun to sweep is <strong>AI in the game industry</strong>.</p>
<p>AI is a powerful tool in many ways to improve the gaming experience. It can make <strong>artificial intelligence in computer games</strong> more believable and add replayability and immersion to games, and we can expect to see even more impressive applications in the future.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-AI-in-Gaming-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-AI-in-Gaming-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is AI in Gaming?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is AI in Gaming?</strong></h2><p>In simple terms, AI is a set of algorithms that allow a computer to learn and improve from experience. Although you can apply it in many ways, <strong>artificial intelligence in video games</strong> is usually helpful to create more intelligent and more believable non-player characters (NPCs).</p>
<p>For example, an AI system might be helpful to determine how an NPC reacts to the player’s actions. If the player tries to steal from an NPC, the AI might make the NPC angry and more likely to attack the player. Alternatively, if the player is friendly to an NPC, the <strong>AI game playing</strong> might make the NPC more likely to help the player in future interactions.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-AI-in-Gaming-Matter-1"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-AI-in-Gaming-Matter-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?"></a>Part 2 <strong>Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?</strong></h2><p>One of the most vital aspects of <strong>AI in video games</strong> is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players. When games can convincingly simulate human-like behavior, it can be a much more enjoyable experience for gamers. AI can make NPCs seem more lifelike and make the game world feel more believable.</p>
<p>AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets. For example, a game might use procedural generation to create random dungeons or quests that the player can explore. This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-AI-Will-Completely-Change-Video-Games-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-AI-Will-Completely-Change-Video-Games-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How AI Will Completely Change Video Games"></a>Part 3 <strong>How AI Will Completely Change Video Games</strong></h2><p>It is not a secret that AI is changing the world as we know it. With its ability to enable computers to learn and improve from experience, AI is paving the way for a future where machines can handle more complex tasks. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of video gaming.</p>
<p>In the past, developers brought in AI primarily for simple things like making certain NPCs (non-player characters) move and act realistically. But now, <strong>artificial intelligence in video games</strong> is being used for much more complex tasks like generating procedural content and creating believable human-like behavior. This results in a new generation of <strong>AI game playing</strong> that are more immersive and playable.</p>

<p>The gaming world is ever-changing, with developers looking to create innovative ways to immerse players into their digital worlds. One such technology that has begun to sweep is <strong>AI in the game industry</strong>.</p>
<p>AI is a powerful tool in many ways to improve the gaming experience. It can make <strong>artificial intelligence in computer games</strong> more believable and add replayability and immersion to games, and we can expect to see even more impressive applications in the future.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-AI-in-Gaming-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-AI-in-Gaming-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is AI in Gaming?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is AI in Gaming?</strong></h2><p>In simple terms, AI is a set of algorithms that allow a computer to learn and improve from experience. Although you can apply it in many ways, <strong>artificial intelligence in video games</strong> is usually helpful to create more intelligent and more believable non-player characters (NPCs).</p>
<p>For example, an AI system might be helpful to determine how an NPC reacts to the player’s actions. If the player tries to steal from an NPC, the AI might make the NPC angry and more likely to attack the player. Alternatively, if the player is friendly to an NPC, the <strong>AI game playing</strong> might make the NPC more likely to help the player in future interactions.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-AI-in-Gaming-Matter-3"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-AI-in-Gaming-Matter-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?"></a>Part 2 <strong>Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?</strong></h2><p>One of the most vital aspects of <strong>AI in video games</strong> is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players. When games can convincingly simulate human-like behavior, it can be a much more enjoyable experience for gamers. AI can make NPCs seem more lifelike and make the game world feel more believable.</p>
<p>AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets. For example, a game might use procedural generation to create random dungeons or quests that the player can explore. This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-AI-Will-Completely-Change-Video-Games-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-AI-Will-Completely-Change-Video-Games-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How AI Will Completely Change Video Games"></a>Part 3 <strong>How AI Will Completely Change Video Games</strong></h2><p>It is not a secret that AI is changing the world as we know it. With its ability to enable computers to learn and improve from experience, AI is paving the way for a future where machines can handle more complex tasks. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of video gaming.</p>
<p>In the past, developers brought in AI primarily for simple things like making certain NPCs (non-player characters) move and act realistically. But now, <strong>artificial intelligence in video games</strong> is being used for much more complex tasks like generating procedural content and creating believable human-like behavior. This results in a new generation of <strong>AI game playing</strong> that are more immersive and playable.</p>

When you take images or record sound, you frequently end up with distorted results due to lens distortion. In this article, we will discuss what lens distortion is, how it may be fixed, and the factors you need to pay attention to avoid lens distortion when taking or recording videos.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Basic-introduction-to-lens-distortion"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-introduction-to-lens-distortion" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic introduction to lens distortion"></a>Part 1: Basic introduction to lens distortion</h2><p><strong>1. What is lens distortion</strong></p>
<p>Distortion means that the straight rectilinear projection is not straight. In the pinhole camera model, lens distortion is measured by how far from the image’s ideal projection is. From a geometric optics point of view, the scene’s straight lines don’t look straight in the image.</p>
<p>When you take a picture, the camera lens can somehow change the shape of the image. It is called camera lens distortion. In simple terms, we can tell you that this is the case because distortion in-camera is when the lens makes curved lines in an image and doesn’t show the straight lines from the scene.</p>
<p><strong>2. What cause it</strong></p>
<p>Lens distortion happens with all lenses. It is because of several things, such as how the lens is curved, how far away the subject is, and the angle at which the photo was taken. Furthermore, it changes the image in many ways, but you can see it most when straight lines at the frame’s edges are no longer parallel.</p>
<p>Most geometric lens distortions happen when the focal distance is short (barrel distortion), long (pincushion distortion), or when a fish-eye lens is used to take a picture from a low angle (keystone distortion).</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-correct-a-distorted-lens"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-correct-a-distorted-lens" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to correct a distorted lens?"></a>Part 2: How to correct a distorted lens?</h2><p>A lot of times, with lower-end wide-angle lenses, especially action cams like GoPro, you get pretty gnarly distortion when you’re filming. As we know, the Earth is round, but it shouldn’t look like this when you take a picture. Indeed, it’s very distorted, it has the horizon line bending all over the place, and basically, all of the lines in the video have some level of curvature.</p>
<p>Hence, follow all the steps below to know how to fix it:</p>
<p>Step1 Import your video to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p>

<p>Step2 Click on the clip and head over to the lens correction. Choose the “Camera model” based on what you used, but in this tutorial, the video was taken with a GoPro Hero 7. However, you can choose some other camera model options there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click on the clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 To adjust the distortion, you can slide the bar to the left or the right. If you slide the bar to the right (maximum level), there will be no adjustment. However, if you slide the bar to the left, you can see it pulling those lines as high up as possible.</p>
<p>You can see a bit of curvature, but it looks much more natural, and all of the lines in the video look so much better.</p>

                      alt="adjust the distortion"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Lastly, if you play the video back, you will see the video look much better than before.</p>

Avoid very wide-angle lenses</strong></p>
<p>The more distortion there is in a lens, like a 15mm prime, the wider it is. Sometimes you need a very wide-angle lens, and distortion is unavoidable. If you have room to move back, you could try using a lens with a different focal length.</p>
<p><strong>2. Avoid getting too close</strong></p>
<p>Doing so will enhance optical distortion in many lenses and the likelihood of perspective distortion in all lenses.</p>
<p><strong>3. Be mindful of your composition</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous instances where distortion is acceptable or even intended. Others must be carefully examined, such as utilizing a wide-angle lens to photograph a row of people. When you get too close to a group, the distortion makes the people at each end appear considerably wider! Therefore, consider your composition. Stand back and add space around your group; if necessary, you can trim the image afterward.</p>
<p><strong>4. Use a 50mm lens</strong></p>
<p>50mm lenses are often called “all-purpose” lenses. There is a good reason</p>
<p>for this. A 50mm lens is great for portraits, street photography, and many other kinds of photography, including architecture. If your subject is big, you just need space to stand back. You will see that a 50mm lens rarely distorts the image.</p>

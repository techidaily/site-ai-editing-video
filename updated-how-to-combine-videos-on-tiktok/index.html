On that note, let’s begin.</p>
<p><strong>2 Practical Ways to Combine Videos on TikTok</strong></p>
<p>This section will explore two practical ways to help you combine videos on TikTok. First, follow the steps outlined to complete the process.</p>
<p><strong>Using the TikTok Camera</strong></p>
<p>You can first combine videos on TikTok by using its official camera. To achieve this, follow the steps outlined below to combine your videos seamlessly.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, visit TikTok and click the ‘+’ icon at the bottom of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-1.jpg"
                      alt="combile-tiktok-videos-"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you do this, you can advance to recording the clips you want.</li>
<li>Click the timer button at the top of the screen to choose how long you would like to shoot your video; you can select 5 seconds, 10 seconds, etc.</li>
<li>Before starting the countdown, drag the red bar by the audio track to where you want the clip to end.</li>
<li>You can repeat the recording many times to have many clips recorded.</li>
<li>Once you’re done recording, click the ‘adjust clip’ icon to adjust your video clips.</li>
<li>After adjusting, hit the ‘done’ button and have your combined video.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can go ahead and share with your followers and the general public.</p>
<p><strong>Use the Combining Function</strong></p>
<p>The second practical way you can combine TikTok videos into a single video is by using the app’s built-in combining function. To find out how you can use this technique for your videos, follow the steps outlined below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once you have the TikTok app on your device, open it and go to the menu bar. Select the ‘+’ button; it should be at the end of the screen.</li>
<li>Instead of recording through the TikTok camera, choose the ‘upload’ button, and it will take you to your device storage, where you can select the videos you would like to upload on TikTok.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-2.jpg"
                      alt="combile-tiktok-videos-"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, choose the ‘select multiple’ option at the left corner of your screen. Once you select this option, you can select different videos you would like to join together. Once you are satisfied with your choice, hit the ‘next’ button.</li>
<li>TikTok will allow you to combine the videos for up to 60 seconds. You can customize the video arrangement according to your preference.</li>
<li>If you’re satisfied with the final video result, click the next option, and you can share it on your TikTok account.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-3.jpg"
                      alt="combile-tiktok-videos-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>How to Combine Draft Videos on TikTok</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know how to combine videos on TikTok, you’re probably wondering about the best way to combine the drafts you saved on your TikTok account. Maybe when you made the videos, you were unmotivated to upload them. However, now you want to combine the videos into a single video and don’t know how to proceed. So, follow the steps outlined in this article to get it done.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Go to Your Drafts</strong></p>
<p>To begin, you have to launch the TikTok app and click on the ‘me’ option at the end of the screen. Then, it will redirect you to your profile, choose the ‘drafts’ category, and take you to the videos you saved on the app and never published.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Update Privacy Settings</strong></p>
<p>Now you want to change the privacy setting in the ‘who can watch this video’ category to ‘just me.’ After updating, tap on ‘post.’ After posting your video, you can change the setting by clicking on ‘change cut.’ You can reduce the video length and add new videos to combine TikTok drafts.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Filters and More Effects</strong></p>
<p>You can also add music to your newly combined video and texts, stickers, filters, and many more effects to enhance your video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save Draft</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-4.jpg"
                      alt="combile-tiktok-videos-"
                ></p>

<li>Download the first video, and you can use the combining feature on TikTok to make the video run next to each other</li>
<li>Once you’re satisfied, you can now proceed to post your video.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Learn to Perform Duets on TikTok</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Another thing you can do on TikTok is to duet with other TikTok users</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="combile-tiktok-videos-"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>To do this, go to TikTok and find the video you would like to duet</li>
<li>At the end of the screen, click on the ‘share’ option and choose ‘duet’ from the option available</li>
<li>Tap the red icon at the middle of the screen to start recording your video; your video usually appears on the left while the other video shows up in the right corner.</li>
<li>Once you’re done recording, click the checkmark icon at the top of the screen to save your recording.</li>
<li>Replay the duet to ensure you like the result; you can add effects, stickers, and other editing features you want to the video before you post.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Set a Timer for Recording Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One of the ways you can record multiple scenes for a video is by using the recording tool; the steps below show you how to do that.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-22.jpg"
                      alt="combile-tiktok-videos-"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you launch TikTok and click on the camera icon</li>
<li>Tap the ‘clock’ icon at the side of the screen; you can choose between 3-10 seconds</li>
<li>Click the red circle to start recording</li>
<li>A countdown on the screen gives you time to get ready to record. Once the countdown gets to zero, TikTok starts recording your video.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use the Stitch Feature</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Stitched videos allow you to add the first maker’s details in the new video; these details connect TikTok users to the first video. It is quite easy to stitch one video to another. Simply navigate to the ‘privacy and settings’ tab, and you can enable or disable stitching for your TikTok videos; you can also turn this on and off for your videos. Follow the steps below to stitch your TikTok videos.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="combile-tiktok-videos-"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Open the TikTok app and choose the video you would like to stitch</li>
<li>Now choose the three-dot icon and select the ‘advanced’ option</li>
<li>You can stitch up to five seconds from the video you would like to stick to add to the current video.</li>
<li>You can add recordings to the stitched option and then stitch them together to post.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Whether you’re a stranger to the TikTok scene or a professional, TikTok is quite popular as a video-sharing platform. However, you don’t always get it right the first time, and you might want to combine various videos into one perfect option to upload. Apart from the two practical ways you can do this on TikTok, we also share three third-party apps you can use to achieve this.

I return home, thinking that the shots were not so bad, look at the new footage on the bigger screen than my phone would have provided, and – no! I am totally wrong! This footage has some kind of little dots all over it, the whole shot looks sort of pixelated. I understand that the circumstances were not so good for shooting, but how come the video is actually this bad? How to get rid of this annoying dot-like overlay, that hinders me from seeing some details and makes my eyes exhausted? Is there a way to make this better at all?</p>
<p>Yeah, this is something called noise, and something called grain can also be in play. And is there a way to solve the problem? –Yes! Technology is getting so good from day to day that editing programs offer the ways to not be bothered because of this problem.</p>
<p>But noise is a word that not necessarily evoke the image of the visual side, rather, for the broader society, it is connected to the audio. A room, filled with some people hanging out and chatting, air conditioner that creates some sound, an opened window from where the chirping of the birds are coming… Anyway, I am still trying to concentrate, to make my voice recording, and then edit the video. Even in this case, I think everything is going pretty well, and the scenario is so alike: I record the whole text I have to follow, then try to listen to it in the speakers or in the headphones, and – SOS again! These noises I mentioned, are filling up my recording, where only my words should be played. Now, I don’t like to cut the parts of my whole recording one by one, and relentlessly, like a butcher, because I am just trying to create a good listener, or viewer experience, and slicing my piece will only make things work. There should be another way!</p>
<p>And yes, there also is. I can solve this problem using some editing software as well. It might even take me only a while and I will have a great voice recording to include in my content. So, my choice, in this case, would be Adobe After Effects – you will say, wow, why so serious? (because this is a very powerful and sophisticated program!) but the answer is – because we can, and because it gives us many opportunity.</p>
<p>So, as you may have noticed already, in this article we will be touching upon audio and video denoising in Adobe After Effects! Let’s get started and solve those little problems we have in our everyday life and work!</p>
<p><strong>How to denoise a video in Adobe After Effects</strong></p>
<p>So, denoising in image and video production is used as a technique to take footage from grainy to crystal-clear, and this is exactly our target. But when can we say that the video noise reduction went well? This method achieves its goal If it suppresses noise effectively in uniform regions; preserves edges and other characteristics, such as fine details and textures; and provides a visually natural experience.</p>
<p>Primarily, Adobe After Effects is a digital visual effects, motion graphics, and compositing application. If you are skilled, you are almost invincible in this software, meaning that you can do almost everything that sparks your imagination. So, if that is the sophistication of the program, why can it not be so that it can help us get rid of the unwanted noise and grain on the scene? There is no answer, because of course, it can.</p>
<p>Even though sometimes this kind of software requires you to download and install and then finally use some external resources, such as plugins, there is a way to do what we are going to, without any help from outside of the program.</p>
<p>First of all, I suppose you have some video you want to edit and make better. Bringing that clip into the program would be the first step of our little adventure. And see the menu where it says Effect? – you need to click on it. Then it gets pretty, meaning very… meaning extremely straightforward – you will find it written – Noise and Grain. Of course, you will need to choose it, and then see the Remove Grain option, to which you are going to stick.</p>

                      alt="denoise-after-effects"
                ></p>
<p>Then, you will need to move your attention to the left side of the screen, where Effects Control will open. By default, you are able to see viewing mode, where Preview can be changed to Final Output, which is exactly what you are going to do.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>And this is the look of the same frame from the video whenever Final Output is turned on:</p>

                ></p>
<p>Yes, it’s true – we have done it already! This is actually this fast and easy in Adobe After Effects – no more noise, no more grain! Anyway, if you want to see the whole process on the video, you can check it <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8pqSysA90" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>!</p>
<p><strong>How to denoise an audio in Adobe After Effects</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to audio noise, as we have mentioned already, it is possible to master the recording in After Effects in terms of the voice as well, but in reality, After Effects requires another Adobe program called Audition. Let us say that you have a video with audio attached, and you are working in AE, but in order to remove the background noise, you will need to open Audition. Here’s how it’s done:</p>
<p>First, in the sequence, you will need to click twice on the video clip, which will open audio graphics below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-after-effects-5.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-after-effects"
                ></p>
<p>Then, go to Edit in the Navbar, and choose Edit in Adobe Audition.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-after-effects-6.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-after-effects"
                ></p>
<p>This program will open and show you more detailed graphic image of the voice recording. Now, you will find the space of time in your recording when you have a somewhat damaged audio and you will select the beginning and the end of it with the mouse. Keep in mind that in case you need to take a look at the video when your audio is played, you can see a little window showing the scene on the left and bottom of your screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-after-effects-7.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-after-effects"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have the selection and are determined with it, you right click on the selection and find Capture Noise Print. Then, you will click on the selection again and find Select all, which will cover the whole audio. That’s when you go to the Navbar again and find Effects -&gt; Noise Reduction &#x2F; Restoration -&gt; Noise Reduction (process). This will open the graphics again, where you can reduce the noise – you will see the percentage scale where you can modify the noise.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-after-effects-8.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-after-effects"
                ></p>
<p>After changing it a little, you will click on the Apply and be able to visually see how the flow has changed and lowered.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-after-effects-9.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-after-effects"
                ></p>
<p>So, when you deselect the selection and play the recording, you will notice that from now on the words are hearable, but some background noise is not there anymore! In order to export, please go to the File and Export, choose your preferred settings and you are ready to go!</p>

<p><strong>How to denoise an audio in Adobe After Effects</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to audio noise, as we have mentioned already, it is possible to master the recording in After Effects in terms of the voice as well, but in reality, After Effects requires another Adobe program called Audition. Let us say that you have a video with audio attached, and you are working in AE, but in order to remove the background noise, you will need to open Audition. Here’s how it’s done:</p>
<p>First, in the sequence, you will need to click twice on the video clip, which will open audio graphics below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-after-effects-5.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-after-effects"
                ></p>
<p>Then, go to Edit in the Navbar, and choose Edit in Adobe Audition.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-after-effects-6.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-after-effects"
                ></p>
<p>This program will open and show you more detailed graphic image of the voice recording. Now, you will find the space of time in your recording when you have a somewhat damaged audio and you will select the beginning and the end of it with the mouse. Keep in mind that in case you need to take a look at the video when your audio is played, you can see a little window showing the scene on the left and bottom of your screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="denoise-after-effects"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have the selection and are determined with it, you right click on the selection and find Capture Noise Print. Then, you will click on the selection again and find Select all, which will cover the whole audio. That’s when you go to the Navbar again and find Effects -&gt; Noise Reduction &#x2F; Restoration -&gt; Noise Reduction (process). This will open the graphics again, where you can reduce the noise – you will see the percentage scale where you can modify the noise.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-after-effects-8.jpg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To add slow motion effect to part of the video, you need to split the video first and then right click it to choose <strong>Speed</strong> and <strong>Duration</strong>. There will be a pop-up window. The motion effects will be sped up or slowed down based on the speed values.</p>

Here is how you can use CapCut to transform a regular video into a slow-mo one:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <strong>Create A New Project</strong> on the CapCut app’s home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: When you’re ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the <strong>Mute clip audio</strong> button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" mute video audio capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you just want to add a slo-mo effect to part of the video, you need to split the video accordingly. Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the <strong>Split</strong> button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the <strong>Speed</strong> menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-speed-menu.jpg"
                      alt=" speed option in capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Curve</strong>, respectively. You may just choose the “<strong>Normal</strong>“ option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video’s frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the <strong>Check</strong> box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Make a slow motion video at this stage to spice things up. CapCut allows you to add text, create transition effects, and more.</p>

Here is how you can use CapCut to transform a regular video into a slow-mo one:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <strong>Create A New Project</strong> on the CapCut app’s home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: When you’re ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the <strong>Mute clip audio</strong> button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" mute video audio capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you just want to add a slo-mo effect to part of the video, you need to split the video accordingly. Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the <strong>Split</strong> button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the <strong>Speed</strong> menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-speed-menu.jpg"
                      alt=" speed option in capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Curve</strong>, respectively. You may just choose the “<strong>Normal</strong>“ option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video’s frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the <strong>Check</strong> box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" change speed  in capcut"
                ></p>
<p>Make a slow motion video at this stage to spice things up. CapCut allows you to add text, create transition effects, and more.</p>

For example, you may use the Photos App pre-installed on Windows 10 machines to apply the slow-motion effect to your photographs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Right click the video and choose Open with Photos. If it has been recorded by an iPhone or Android device and stored up to OneDrive, it should appear in the Microsoft Photos app without any further effort. Just click it to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the <strong>Edit &amp; Create</strong> option on the right corner on the top, and then select <strong>Add slo-mo</strong> option.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using the slider, you can determine how slowly you want it to go. Microsoft has built-in support for “<strong>Slow</strong>“ and “<strong>Super-Slow</strong>“ performance levels. Drag the slide to the right end will trigger the super slow mode.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Specifiy the part that you want to apply slow motion in the playback bar at the bottom, and then save the video that you have just <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >created with slow motion effects on Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>The possibility exists that you are using an older version of Windows 10 on your computer if you do not see the option anywhere in the Photos app. You can also follow the steps above to create a slow motion video on Windows 11.</p>
<p>Browse Windows Update from the system menu and click on the appropriate button. When all of the updates have been installed, you will have the most recent version of the Photos app, which includes this functionality.</p>

<p>However, if you don’t record video on your iPhone, making slow motion out of videos shot on other cameras or devices is more challenging. The good news is that iMovie for Mac can do this for you. We’ll show you how in this guide.</p>
<p>Slow-motion films are easy to make <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >using iMovie on your Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Just follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Click on the <strong>Import Media</strong> option in iMovie once launched on your Mac.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the blue <strong>Import Selected</strong> button once you’ve selected the video file in the file browser to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You may now open the movie in iMovie. Creating a <strong>Project</strong> is required at this stage. To do so, click on the Projects option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you’ve entered a name for your project, click the blue <strong>OK</strong> button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> By dragging the movie onto your timeline, you may modify the video. Select the video by clicking on it and clicking on the <strong>Speed</strong> option to change its speed.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: The duration of your movie will be increased by halves the pace at which it was initially recorded. The video may be slowed down even further by moving the <strong><em>speed slider</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: Go to the Menu Bar and choose <strong>File &gt; Share</strong>. Select the file you want to share.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Click the blue <strong>Next</strong> button once you’ve selected the properties you want for the file.</p>

Here is how you can use CapCut to transform a regular video into a slow-mo one:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <strong>Create A New Project</strong> on the CapCut app’s home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: When you’re ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the <strong>Mute clip audio</strong> button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you just want to add a slo-mo effect to part of the video, you need to split the video accordingly. Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the <strong>Split</strong> button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the <strong>Speed</strong> menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.</p>

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Curve</strong>, respectively. You may just choose the “<strong>Normal</strong>“ option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video’s frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the <strong>Check</strong> box.</p>

For example, you may use the Photos App pre-installed on Windows 10 machines to apply the slow-motion effect to your photographs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Right click the video and choose Open with Photos. If it has been recorded by an iPhone or Android device and stored up to OneDrive, it should appear in the Microsoft Photos app without any further effort. Just click it to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the <strong>Edit &amp; Create</strong> option on the right corner on the top, and then select <strong>Add slo-mo</strong> option.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using the slider, you can determine how slowly you want it to go. Microsoft has built-in support for “<strong>Slow</strong>“ and “<strong>Super-Slow</strong>“ performance levels. Drag the slide to the right end will trigger the super slow mode.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Specifiy the part that you want to apply slow motion in the playback bar at the bottom, and then save the video that you have just <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >created with slow motion effects on Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>The possibility exists that you are using an older version of Windows 10 on your computer if you do not see the option anywhere in the Photos app. You can also follow the steps above to create a slow motion video on Windows 11.</p>
<p>Browse Windows Update from the system menu and click on the appropriate button. When all of the updates have been installed, you will have the most recent version of the Photos app, which includes this functionality.</p>

Video may be recorded with a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >frame rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of 120 or 240 fps and then played back at a considerably slower rate than usual.</p>
<p>However, if you don’t record video on your iPhone, making slow motion out of videos shot on other cameras or devices is more challenging. The good news is that iMovie for Mac can do this for you. We’ll show you how in this guide.</p>
<p>Slow-motion films are easy to make <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >using iMovie on your Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Just follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Click on the <strong>Import Media</strong> option in iMovie once launched on your Mac.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the blue <strong>Import Selected</strong> button once you’ve selected the video file in the file browser to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You may now open the movie in iMovie. Creating a <strong>Project</strong> is required at this stage. To do so, click on the Projects option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you’ve entered a name for your project, click the blue <strong>OK</strong> button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> By dragging the movie onto your timeline, you may modify the video. Select the video by clicking on it and clicking on the <strong>Speed</strong> option to change its speed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: The speed-editing interface will be shown here. Change <strong>Normal to Slow</strong> in the Speed drop-down menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: The duration of your movie will be increased by halves the pace at which it was initially recorded. The video may be slowed down even further by moving the <strong><em>speed slider</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: Go to the Menu Bar and choose <strong>File &gt; Share</strong>. Select the file you want to share.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Click the blue <strong>Next</strong> button once you’ve selected the properties you want for the file.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Select a name for the file, store it, and then click the blue <strong>Save</strong> button to save it to your computer.</p>

Using shortcut keys or hotkeys is one method, while menus and buttons are another. Both methods are OK, but the shortcut option is the quickest and most efficient.</p>
<p>Speed up and speed down buttons appear on the upper right of the movie when you press them. Depending on how much you tweak it, the speed is represented as 1.50x or 0.80x. This option is available for those who like to use other shortcut keys.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: From the VLC menu bar, head over to the <strong>Playback</strong> for <strong>Speed</strong> and choose a speed option: <em>slower, slower (fine), normal, faster (fine), and faster</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Right-clicking is also possible to access these parameters from the Playback &gt; Speed menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The video’s speed may be altered by selecting one of those options and then clicking the appropriate button.</p>

But that’s not all.</p>
<p>No doubt on the significance of the aforesaid elements in crafting the most perfect anime design, but an essential fact that naturally goes unnoticed is the creator’s own interpretations and thoughts about the specific anime characters that are responsible for delivering a captivating story.

<h3 id="02Miss-Kobayashi’s-Dragon-Maid"><a href="#02Miss-Kobayashi’s-Dragon-Maid" class="headerlink" title="02Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid"></a>02Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid</h3><p><strong>Main Attractive Design Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The series is a classic school level anime series with a reflective character design</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character formations have a minute and distinguished detailing in physical features and body language</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The costumes, shade summaries and specific personality etiquettes work to set up a subtle communication among the characters</p>
<p>Centered greatly on school level anime creation, the most reflective aspects of Kyoto Animation character designs are present in the quick apparel changes and impressive body language. For instance, a simple flip of the hair can say a lot about a character’s personality of being lazy or active. It is however, interesting to note that Kyoto Animation did not have a significant recognition in character design before the advent of Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid.</p>
<p>The aforesaid anime series opened massive doors for the animation company to try hands at experimenting with the epic cuteness that the latter is known for in today’s times. Be it the character costumes, color patterns, or even a quick shine in the eye, everything works so perfectly to build up a subtle communication among the dragon girls of this series.</p>
<p>The minute detailing works to highlight the differences between the respective personalities of these characters, along with setting each one miles apart from the other in a hoard of aspects.</p>

<h3 id="03Kill-La-Kill"><a href="#03Kill-La-Kill" class="headerlink" title="03Kill La Kill"></a>03Kill La Kill</h3><p><strong>Main Attractive Design Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>animation character design</strong> of this anime series is inspired by the art style of Studio Trigger</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The best thing about the aforesaid character formations is the flawless homogeneity among the apparel design, color coding and line work</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character frames are also quite impressive and neatly adopted to the formations</p>
<p>The character design schematics of Kill La Kill attempts to display the best version of Studio Trigger’s art style. As of the specific design form, the latter works to strike the closest communication between the line work, color and costume design. A significant amount of character information can be drawn out with just a close observation of these details.</p>
<p>For instance, you can figure out the silly nature of Mayo, or the jittery one of Ryuko by sparing a mere look at their specific character outlines. Moving ahead, you can make out a clear difference among each of the Student Council Members. The expressive play of vibrant shades in the characters’ costumes makes them appear no less than those of a fight sequence.</p>
<p>No doubt on the animation expertise of Studio Trigger; yet the latter has worked a lot on their character frames as well. The anime flick has a neat adoption of these elusive character design aspects to put forward a masterpiece of art.</p>

<h3 id="04Naruto"><a href="#04Naruto" class="headerlink" title="04Naruto"></a>04Naruto</h3><p><strong>Main Attractive Design Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The Naruto anime series has succeeded in showcasing the Shonen Jump character design in possibly the best possible manner</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character design aims to bind together the characters’ personalities with their abilities and the contemporary culture</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character design is a balanced play of character communication and formation diversities</p>
<p>One of the 3 major anime productions that have incorporated the Shonen Jump’s style of character design, Naruto is credited with the depicting the best play of art through its set of the closest resembling characters. Talking of the impersonation of the other two flicks, One Piece showcases a vibrant but quite a caricaturized character formation.</p>
<p>Bleach on the other hand, excels on the artwork parameter, but relies much on customarily jumping character designs. Being far ahead of these two, Naruto succeeds to strike a balance between the expanded diversity of character formations, along with establishing an intimate communication between culture, abilities and specific character personalities.</p>
<p>A few classic examples of the expressive character sketches from the series include Konoha’s green vest, the robe-themed costume of the Village Hidden in the Sand, and the mufflers of the Village Hidden by Sound. The main leads have some distinctive and classic costume designs of their own. Having the most distinguished and catchy appeal, such elusive character designs are not going to be forgotten anytime soon.</p>

<h3 id="05Monogatari"><a href="#05Monogatari" class="headerlink" title="05Monogatari"></a>05Monogatari</h3><p><strong>Main Attractive Design Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character design takes its inspiration from the Studio Shaft anime character formations</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The body language and dressing of each character are in line with the flow of the story, giving the characters their explicit communication space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The unique dressing style of each character is distinguished enough to clearly differentiate among personalities with a similar profile</p>
<p>Though another member in the list of high school anime series; Monogatari is no way similar to the customary, school centered anime creations. The credit undeniably goes to the exquisite character design of Studio Shaft that solely resolved to craft a unique piece of artwork for the series. An additional factor working in favor of the series is the effective communication between the latter’s student characters.</p>
<p>Regardless of the fact that the series features high school pupils as the main characters, they are gifted with a wide canvas to express their specific characterizations. Be it the body language, or the distinguished costume style, each character has its own space to communicate with the story.</p>
<p>Whether it is the extravagant dress of Kiss Shot, Karen’s egg braid and track suit in yellow, or the explicitly visible difference between Hanekawa and Senjougahara’s eye looks, everyone has its own signature style or appearance. It is impossible to have confusion between 2 characters of the series, or a 3rd one on a parallel space.</p>

<h3 id="06Hunter-X-Hunter"><a href="#06Hunter-X-Hunter" class="headerlink" title="06Hunter X Hunter"></a>06Hunter X Hunter</h3><p><strong>Main Attractive Design Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The aforesaid series showcases affordably the weirdest character designs ever, but that’s what the captivating factor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character styling and costume design is centered on an animal theme</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The body language of the non-animal characters is no less in adding to the uniqueness of character formations</p>
<p>Looking from the character design aspect, the aforesaid anime series may appear more as an odd synchronization of styling elements to most of us. However, this very weirdness is the catchy cue of the special character formations of the Hunter X Hunter storyline. Consisting of the most influential members of the Hunter Association, the character assimilation is entirely centered on the animal theme picked by the chairman.</p>
<p>The characters are made to wear some the most oddly pronounced looks, like that of Cheadle, who appears to be a dog. The striking attraction of the character design is however, the non-animal costumes of some characters, who talk better with their attitudes. A few instances include the uncomfortably clean behavior of Pariston, and Ging’s ugly, beggar-like appearance.</p>
<p>The weird and overly pronounced character design draws its inspiration from the dark designs of the Phantom Troop, the Zoldyck’s ghastly stares in casual attire, and the absence of any sort of biological resemblances in the Chimera Ants.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The character design of this anime series is based on a personality centered color coding</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The physical features and accessories used by the characters are most specific and highly pronounced</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character design is engaging enough to captivate the audience to a not so impressive storyline</p>
<p>When the talk is about classic and memorable anime series, the aforesaid story would apparently fail to secure a spot in the list. While there was nothing as weird with the plot, it just could not click instantly to the audiences in a manner similar to most of the contemporary classics. The engaging character design and elegant artwork of the series however, has managed to carve out a space in the viewers’ mind even in the current times.</p>
<p>All the members of Night Raid are given an extremely distinguished appearance; to such an extent that each one seems to have a personality centered shade code. An identical characterization works for the police forces of The Empire, who have a list of reprobates with a diversity of their own facial expressions and armors.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The character sketches further aim to put forward the dressing style, culture, expressions, instincts and anatomy of animal creatures</p>
<p>As we approach towards the end of the list, here is the Beastars anime series with a stunningly amazing style of character design. The series is regarded more as an attempt of cutting down on crafting human character formations.

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Character Illustrations</strong></p>
<p>Viewed more as a classification than a character design style, the 3D character formations are getting a rapid grip in the world of motion graphics and animation. Talking of the underlying concept, the 3D effect comes into play with the complementary usage if the shading and shadow techniques, ensuring a much pronounced viewer engagement.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Flat Character Illustrations</strong></p>
<p>These character designs create an effect in an absolute contrast to the 3D illustrations discussed above. This particular style of character formation does not cater any sort of lifelike imagery or character movement. Nevertheless, these designs are expressive enough to convey direct and precise messages to the audience. Graphic symbols and icons fall into this category of character design.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Abstract Character Illustrations</strong></p>
<p>Such a style of character design is used to complement the liberty of abstraction in line with some particular aspect of a character. The catchy and engaging design aims to infuse the element of interest among the audience, while often demanding a bit of effort from the viewers’ part to exactly comprehend the underlying message.

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Hand Drawn Character Illustrations</strong></p>
<p>This style of anime character design is more suited to a craft oriented application that generally has a personal touch and appeal. While such designs deliver a somewhat vague interpretation of the character’s personality, they are well and good to work as supplementary elements to a creative expression of business ideas. The advent of novel software packages for graphic design applications allow you to create such character designs digitally, ahead of paper.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Character Outline</strong></p>
<p>Start with planning out the fundamental image and appearance of your character. Pen down the minimum details that the character is supposed to retain, of course in line with the message it has to deliver. Moving a bit deeper, point out the essentials of the character’s basic personality, like, the costumes, accessories, postures and physical features.</p>
<p>In case you are focused on designing a human character formation, take care to punch in some fundamental information about the same in your design. Moving in to add more comprehensive detailing, you can include the elements of age, occupation, etc. When everything is set and you have all the requisite details at one place, it’s time to proceed towards the next step.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Sketch Out a Rough Design</strong></p>
<p>Having all the character details by your side, proceed to club them in a rough sketch. You are free to select the viewing angle and posture of your character in line with your specific preferences. it is a smart idea to design a minimum of one complete figure sketch and a few variations of close up facial expressions.</p>
<p>Some specific character designs require having a particular size preference for the character, like that of it being specifically small or big. In such a case, you can have a better analysis of your character’s height by sketching them out in parallel with an additional character with an average size. It is further advisable to work with a minimum detailing of the different aspects of your character, lest you may end up with a complicated design.</p>
<p>If, at a later stage, the character comes out with a bland appearance, there is always a scope of adding extra details. When you have a host of character sketches portraying specific elements, you can move ahead with selecting the best pieces and combining the same into a single character design.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Develop Your Character Design</strong></p>
<p>The basic design of an anime character is sufficiently crafted in Step 2. However, if you wish to spark up your character design with some extra detailing, move ahead with working on the postures of your character. Sketch the front, back and both sides of your character. It is important to note that should not skip drawing any of the side poses unless you a creating a mirrored effect with the character, where both the sides appear exactly same.</p>
<p>You can further, add some additional posture views from different angles. Trying out the anterior, posterior, top and lateral viewing angles can be of great help when designing complex characters with a comprehensive detailing. Experimenting with a diversity of postures and viewing angles aids to fetch an all-round character design that can be used to work with the same character in different motion graphic applications.</p>
<p>To craft your character’s design in even proportion across different formation views, you can attempt to work with a simple, 2-step process. Draw guidelines of a particular body part in a specific view, followed by using these guidelines to sketch out the same body part in a different view. You should significantly realize the fact that the difference in perspectives does not allow the perfect alignment of specific portions of a character design to its counterparts, when looked through different viewing angles.</p>
<p>As in the following figure, you can easily observe the misalignment of the character’s feet on account of being viewed from the front view. You can also notice the sketches to move a bit ahead of the guideline as the character approaches forward in the front view.</p>

        Shades"

Colors are often linked with setting a specific mood for your creation. For instance, choosing a shade of blue would imbibe a sense of your character being cool, which picking a red tint on the other hand, adds an effect of warmth to the same.</p>
<p>Understating this with an example, you would generally refrain from adding shades of red in a character design that is centered on ice magic fantasy. Instead, picking a blue tint would work a lot better and complementary for this particular character design.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The aforesaid series showcases affordably the weirdest character designs ever, but that’s what the captivating factor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character styling and costume design is centered on an animal theme</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The body language of the non-animal characters is no less in adding to the uniqueness of character formations</p>
<p>Looking from the character design aspect, the aforesaid anime series may appear more as an odd synchronization of styling elements to most of us. However, this very weirdness is the catchy cue of the special character formations of the Hunter X Hunter storyline. Consisting of the most influential members of the Hunter Association, the character assimilation is entirely centered on the animal theme picked by the chairman.</p>

A few instances include the uncomfortably clean behavior of Pariston, and Ging’s ugly, beggar-like appearance.</p>
<p>The weird and overly pronounced character design draws its inspiration from the dark designs of the Phantom Troop, the Zoldyck’s ghastly stares in casual attire, and the absence of any sort of biological resemblances in the Chimera Ants.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The character design is engaging enough to captivate the audience to a not so impressive storyline</p>
<p>When the talk is about classic and memorable anime series, the aforesaid story would apparently fail to secure a spot in the list.

<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Character Outline</strong></p>
<p>Start with planning out the fundamental image and appearance of your character. Pen down the minimum details that the character is supposed to retain, of course in line with the message it has to deliver. Moving a bit deeper, point out the essentials of the character’s basic personality, like, the costumes, accessories, postures and physical features.</p>
<p>In case you are focused on designing a human character formation, take care to punch in some fundamental information about the same in your design. Moving in to add more comprehensive detailing, you can include the elements of age, occupation, etc. When everything is set and you have all the requisite details at one place, it’s time to proceed towards the next step.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Sketch Out a Rough Design</strong></p>
<p>Having all the character details by your side, proceed to club them in a rough sketch. You are free to select the viewing angle and posture of your character in line with your specific preferences. it is a smart idea to design a minimum of one complete figure sketch and a few variations of close up facial expressions.</p>
<p>Some specific character designs require having a particular size preference for the character, like that of it being specifically small or big. In such a case, you can have a better analysis of your character’s height by sketching them out in parallel with an additional character with an average size. It is further advisable to work with a minimum detailing of the different aspects of your character, lest you may end up with a complicated design.</p>
<p>If, at a later stage, the character comes out with a bland appearance, there is always a scope of adding extra details. When you have a host of character sketches portraying specific elements, you can move ahead with selecting the best pieces and combining the same into a single character design.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Develop Your Character Design</strong></p>
<p>The basic design of an anime character is sufficiently crafted in Step 2. However, if you wish to spark up your character design with some extra detailing, move ahead with working on the postures of your character. Sketch the front, back and both sides of your character. It is important to note that should not skip drawing any of the side poses unless you a creating a mirrored effect with the character, where both the sides appear exactly same.</p>
<p>You can further, add some additional posture views from different angles. Trying out the anterior, posterior, top and lateral viewing angles can be of great help when designing complex characters with a comprehensive detailing. Experimenting with a diversity of postures and viewing angles aids to fetch an all-round character design that can be used to work with the same character in different motion graphic applications.</p>
<p>To craft your character’s design in even proportion across different formation views, you can attempt to work with a simple, 2-step process. Draw guidelines of a particular body part in a specific view, followed by using these guidelines to sketch out the same body part in a different view. You should significantly realize the fact that the difference in perspectives does not allow the perfect alignment of specific portions of a character design to its counterparts, when looked through different viewing angles.</p>
<p>As in the following figure, you can easily observe the misalignment of the character’s feet on account of being viewed from the front view. You can also notice the sketches to move a bit ahead of the guideline as the character approaches forward in the front view.</p>

        Shades"

Black and white is the safest choices, as they can go well with almost every color scheme and design specifications.</p>
<p>It would be wise enough to select your shades in line with the overall personality and appeal that your character is aimed at portraying. Colors are often linked with setting a specific mood for your creation. For instance, choosing a shade of blue would imbibe a sense of your character being cool, which picking a red tint on the other hand, adds an effect of warmth to the same.</p>
<p>Understating this with an example, you would generally refrain from adding shades of red in a character design that is centered on ice magic fantasy. Instead, picking a blue tint would work a lot better and complementary for this particular character design.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Sketch Out a Rough Design</strong></p>
<p>Having all the character details by your side, proceed to club them in a rough sketch. You are free to select the viewing angle and posture of your character in line with your specific preferences. it is a smart idea to design a minimum of one complete figure sketch and a few variations of close up facial expressions.</p>
<p>Some specific character designs require having a particular size preference for the character, like that of it being specifically small or big. In such a case, you can have a better analysis of your character’s height by sketching them out in parallel with an additional character with an average size. It is further advisable to work with a minimum detailing of the different aspects of your character, lest you may end up with a complicated design.</p>
<p>If, at a later stage, the character comes out with a bland appearance, there is always a scope of adding extra details.

<p><strong>Step 3: Develop Your Character Design</strong></p>
<p>The basic design of an anime character is sufficiently crafted in Step 2. However, if you wish to spark up your character design with some extra detailing, move ahead with working on the postures of your character. Sketch the front, back and both sides of your character. It is important to note that should not skip drawing any of the side poses unless you a creating a mirrored effect with the character, where both the sides appear exactly same.</p>
<p>You can further, add some additional posture views from different angles. Trying out the anterior, posterior, top and lateral viewing angles can be of great help when designing complex characters with a comprehensive detailing. Experimenting with a diversity of postures and viewing angles aids to fetch an all-round character design that can be used to work with the same character in different motion graphic applications.</p>
<p>To craft your character’s design in even proportion across different formation views, you can attempt to work with a simple, 2-step process. Draw guidelines of a particular body part in a specific view, followed by using these guidelines to sketch out the same body part in a different view. You should significantly realize the fact that the difference in perspectives does not allow the perfect alignment of specific portions of a character design to its counterparts, when looked through different viewing angles.</p>
<p>As in the following figure, you can easily observe the misalignment of the character’s feet on account of being viewed from the front view. You can also notice the sketches to move a bit ahead of the guideline as the character approaches forward in the front view.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Complement Your Design With Perfect Shades</strong></p>

                ></p>

<p><img

        Shades"
                ></p>
<p>It is of course not necessary to pick your color scheme in perfect cohesion with the color wheel. You are free to select the desired variation of a specific color if the latter corresponds with the elements of your character design. Black and white is the safest choices, as they can go well with almost every color scheme and design specifications.</p>
<p>It would be wise enough to select your shades in line with the overall personality and appeal that your character is aimed at portraying. Colors are often linked with setting a specific mood for your creation. For instance, choosing a shade of blue would imbibe a sense of your character being cool, which picking a red tint on the other hand, adds an effect of warmth to the same.</p>
<p>Understating this with an example, you would generally refrain from adding shades of red in a character design that is centered on ice magic fantasy. Instead, picking a blue tint would work a lot better and complementary for this particular character design.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The aforesaid series showcases affordably the weirdest character designs ever, but that’s what the captivating factor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character styling and costume design is centered on an animal theme</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The body language of the non-animal characters is no less in adding to the uniqueness of character formations</p>
<p>Looking from the character design aspect, the aforesaid anime series may appear more as an odd synchronization of styling elements to most of us. However, this very weirdness is the catchy cue of the special character formations of the Hunter X Hunter storyline. Consisting of the most influential members of the Hunter Association, the character assimilation is entirely centered on the animal theme picked by the chairman.</p>

A few instances include the uncomfortably clean behavior of Pariston, and Ging’s ugly, beggar-like appearance.</p>
<p>The weird and overly pronounced character design draws its inspiration from the dark designs of the Phantom Troop, the Zoldyck’s ghastly stares in casual attire, and the absence of any sort of biological resemblances in the Chimera Ants.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The physical features and accessories used by the characters are most specific and highly pronounced</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character design is engaging enough to captivate the audience to a not so impressive storyline</p>
<p>When the talk is about classic and memorable anime series, the aforesaid story would apparently fail to secure a spot in the list.

<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Character Outline</strong></p>
<p>Start with planning out the fundamental image and appearance of your character. Pen down the minimum details that the character is supposed to retain, of course in line with the message it has to deliver. Moving a bit deeper, point out the essentials of the character’s basic personality, like, the costumes, accessories, postures and physical features.</p>
<p>In case you are focused on designing a human character formation, take care to punch in some fundamental information about the same in your design. Moving in to add more comprehensive detailing, you can include the elements of age, occupation, etc. When everything is set and you have all the requisite details at one place, it’s time to proceed towards the next step.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Sketch Out a Rough Design</strong></p>
<p>Having all the character details by your side, proceed to club them in a rough sketch. You are free to select the viewing angle and posture of your character in line with your specific preferences. it is a smart idea to design a minimum of one complete figure sketch and a few variations of close up facial expressions.</p>
<p>Some specific character designs require having a particular size preference for the character, like that of it being specifically small or big. In such a case, you can have a better analysis of your character’s height by sketching them out in parallel with an additional character with an average size. It is further advisable to work with a minimum detailing of the different aspects of your character, lest you may end up with a complicated design.</p>
<p>If, at a later stage, the character comes out with a bland appearance, there is always a scope of adding extra details. When you have a host of character sketches portraying specific elements, you can move ahead with selecting the best pieces and combining the same into a single character design.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Develop Your Character Design</strong></p>
<p>The basic design of an anime character is sufficiently crafted in Step 2. However, if you wish to spark up your character design with some extra detailing, move ahead with working on the postures of your character. Sketch the front, back and both sides of your character. It is important to note that should not skip drawing any of the side poses unless you a creating a mirrored effect with the character, where both the sides appear exactly same.</p>
<p>You can further, add some additional posture views from different angles. Trying out the anterior, posterior, top and lateral viewing angles can be of great help when designing complex characters with a comprehensive detailing. Experimenting with a diversity of postures and viewing angles aids to fetch an all-round character design that can be used to work with the same character in different motion graphic applications.</p>
<p>To craft your character’s design in even proportion across different formation views, you can attempt to work with a simple, 2-step process. Draw guidelines of a particular body part in a specific view, followed by using these guidelines to sketch out the same body part in a different view. You should significantly realize the fact that the difference in perspectives does not allow the perfect alignment of specific portions of a character design to its counterparts, when looked through different viewing angles.</p>
<p>As in the following figure, you can easily observe the misalignment of the character’s feet on account of being viewed from the front view. You can also notice the sketches to move a bit ahead of the guideline as the character approaches forward in the front view.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Complement Your Design With Perfect Shades</strong></p>

        Shades"
                ></p>
<p>It is of course not necessary to pick your color scheme in perfect cohesion with the color wheel. You are free to select the desired variation of a specific color if the latter corresponds with the elements of your character design. Black and white is the safest choices, as they can go well with almost every color scheme and design specifications.</p>
<p>It would be wise enough to select your shades in line with the overall personality and appeal that your character is aimed at portraying. Colors are often linked with setting a specific mood for your creation. For instance, choosing a shade of blue would imbibe a sense of your character being cool, which picking a red tint on the other hand, adds an effect of warmth to the same.</p>
<p>Understating this with an example, you would generally refrain from adding shades of red in a character design that is centered on ice magic fantasy. Instead, picking a blue tint would work a lot better and complementary for this particular character design.</p>

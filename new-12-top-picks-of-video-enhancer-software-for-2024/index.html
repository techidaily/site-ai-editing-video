Amidst this, videos have become a powerful medium to relive the past. If you’re aiming to infuse your videos with a touch of the ‘90s, look no further than the VHS effect.</p>
<p>For those who need a quick trip down memory lane, VHS tapes were once the cornerstone of home entertainment. These clunky plastic cassettes captured countless memories, from family gatherings to favorite films and TV shows. While they might be alien to newer generations, they hold a special place in the chronicles of video evolution.</p>

Incorporating these imperfections into today’s high-definition videos imparts a distinctive vintage flair. It’s akin to applying an Instagram filter to a photo, where a simple touch can transport a viewer back in time. Dive in as we guide you on adding this retro charm to your free videos.</p>

In comparison, HDR has a resolution four times as excellent as an SDR video. With a higher contrast ratio and color information, HDR videos are more vivid and pleasing.</p>
<p>Then why is there a need to convert HDR to SDR? An HDR file is huge and is currently incompatible with many old and some new devices. To view HDR videos, you need to lower the resolution and change the size of the file tidbit to convert it to 1080 SDR without compromising on the quality.</p>
<p>Plenty of HDR converters can perform the task, but only a few have the benefit of retaining the 4K quality of the original video. This article will walk you through the five easiest ways of converting videos from HDR to SDR format. So without further ado, let’s begin.</p>

Handbrake is a household name for video converting, especially when it comes to 4KHDR to SDR video conversions. It has a free open source feature that allows you to convert to SDR videos with an MP4 or MKV format.</p>
<p><strong>Steps of Decoding HDR Video to SDR with Handbrake</strong></p>
<p>Before converting your HDR video to SDR, make sure you have downloaded Handbrake on your computer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open</strong> the Handbrake app.</li>
<li>To import your video to Handbrake, click on <strong>File,</strong> then <strong>Source Selection.</strong> You can also drag and drop the video to scan it. Next, wait for Handbrake to scan the title. Once the video scan is complete, all the information will be displayed in the source section.</li>

<ul>
<li>Once the file is imported, you can now select the output format from the right panel under <strong>General</strong>. The default format already specified in Handbrake is Fast 1080p30; you can change that if you are looking for a different form.</li>
</ul>

<li>You can also change the format depending on the device type in Handbrake.</li>
<li>Lastly, go to <strong>Presets</strong>, click <strong>Production</strong>, and select <strong>Production Standard</strong> to convert 4K HDR video to 4K SDR. You can also do that by going to General Profile under the Legacy column.</li>

But, what do you do if you want to send the video to someone whose phone is incompatible with HDR? The video will appear too bright and washed out.</p>
<p>By converting the video to SDR, you can send them the video without burning their retinas. This method to convert HDR videos to SDR is especially for Samsung Galaxy phones. The gallery app initially used to have a built-in option to do that, but it’s not there anymore. While the original option is removed, you can still use the method below to convert an HDR video to SDR with just a few taps.</p>
<ul>
<li>To convert HDR10+ video to SDR on a Samsung Galaxy phone, you can directly proceed with it on your phone.</li>
<li>Head to and open Gallery, choose your HDR10+ video and tap three dots in the bottom right corner.</li>
<li>From the pop-up menu, select <strong>Open in Video Player.</strong></li>
<li>Once the video opens in the video player, click on another three dots in the top right corner.</li>
<li>From there, tap on the <strong>Editor</strong></li>
<li>In the editor, tap again on three dots on the bottom right and now select Size and Format.</li>
<li>From this menu, you can change the resolution of the video as well as its format. From the format drop-down, you can select SDR to convert your video to SDR.</li>
<li>Make sure you do not tap on <strong>Save;</strong> instead, click on the three dots again and tap on Save as Copy. This will leave your original HDR video untouched and save a copy for the SDR video.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Convert-HDR-4K-Video-to-SDR-with-YouTube-Untested"><a href="#Convert-HDR-4K-Video-to-SDR-with-YouTube-Untested" class="headerlink" title="Convert HDR 4K Video to SDR with YouTube [Untested]"></a>Convert HDR 4K Video to SDR with YouTube [Untested]</h2><p>HDR videos on Youtube show higher color dynamics and contrast ratios than an SDR video. Viewers with HDR-compatible devices will see ‘HDR’ after every video quality option in the video settings (1080p HDR).</p>
<p>However, the videos uploaded as HDR on youtube can be viewed on HDR unsupported devices too. This happens because youtube automatically converts all HDR videos to SDR to be viewed on non-HDR devices. Here is a brief introduction to the steps of converting HDR to SDR on Youtube:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record the metadata by exporting it from an HDR-supported application like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Is SDR better than HDR?"></a>1. Is SDR better than HDR?</h3><p>SDR is Standard Dynamic Range, while HDR stands for High Dynamic Range. HDR is the latest technology concerning quality, clear and detailed images. HDR is perfect for videos that require high contrast, shadows, and mixed light.</p>
<p>HDR is definitely better than SDR because the “High” definition takes everything to the next level. However, SDR is frequently used as most devices are not compatible with HDR.</p>
<h3 id="2-Why-is-HDR-smaller-than-SDR"><a href="#2-Why-is-HDR-smaller-than-SDR" class="headerlink" title="2. Why is HDR smaller than SDR?"></a>2. Why is HDR smaller than SDR?</h3><p>Undoubtedly, HDR provides better image quality, colors, and clarity than SDR, but why is the file size smaller then? The answer is quite simple. HDR10 files are equipped with HVAC. HVAC is a very efficient file compressor that compresses the file while keeping its quality intact. SDR files are not compressed with SDR; hence the file size is much bigger.</p>
<h3 id="3-Why-does-HDR-look-washed-out"><a href="#3-Why-does-HDR-look-washed-out" class="headerlink" title="3. Why does HDR look washed out?"></a>3. Why does HDR look washed out?</h3><p>An HDR video might look too bright or washed out if your device is incompatible with HDR color space. Unlike the iPhone 12 or Samsung Galaxy S22, phones have a built-in HDR recording feature. However, older versions may not be able to enjoy the clarity and colors offered by an HDR recording. Hence when an HDR video is sent to someone with an older phone, it looks as if the video is washed out.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>While HDR might be a superior color space, SDR is frequently used for video clips so maximum people can enjoy the video despite what their devices are compatible with.

<p>An important point to note is that HDR videos converted to SDR might look a little off sometimes with darker shadows and sharpness. It might be a better idea to record in SDR rather than convert it to SDR later. However, converting is still a popular way to go with an HDR video; you will also have a beautiful high-quality video and an SDR copy.</p>

Handbrake is a household name for video converting, especially when it comes to 4KHDR to SDR video conversions. It has a free open source feature that allows you to convert to SDR videos with an MP4 or MKV format.</p>
<p><strong>Steps of Decoding HDR Video to SDR with Handbrake</strong></p>
<p>Before converting your HDR video to SDR, make sure you have downloaded Handbrake on your computer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open</strong> the Handbrake app.</li>
<li>To import your video to Handbrake, click on <strong>File,</strong> then <strong>Source Selection.</strong> You can also drag and drop the video to scan it. Next, wait for Handbrake to scan the title. Once the video scan is complete, all the information will be displayed in the source section.</li>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Once the file is imported, you can now select the output format from the right panel under <strong>General</strong>. The default format already specified in Handbrake is Fast 1080p30; you can change that if you are looking for a different form.</li>
</ul>

But, what do you do if you want to send the video to someone whose phone is incompatible with HDR? The video will appear too bright and washed out.</p>
<p>By converting the video to SDR, you can send them the video without burning their retinas. This method to convert HDR videos to SDR is especially for Samsung Galaxy phones. The gallery app initially used to have a built-in option to do that, but it’s not there anymore. While the original option is removed, you can still use the method below to convert an HDR video to SDR with just a few taps.</p>
<ul>
<li>To convert HDR10+ video to SDR on a Samsung Galaxy phone, you can directly proceed with it on your phone.</li>
<li>Head to and open Gallery, choose your HDR10+ video and tap three dots in the bottom right corner.</li>
<li>From the pop-up menu, select <strong>Open in Video Player.</strong></li>
<li>Once the video opens in the video player, click on another three dots in the top right corner.</li>
<li>From there, tap on the <strong>Editor</strong></li>
<li>In the editor, tap again on three dots on the bottom right and now select Size and Format.</li>
<li>From this menu, you can change the resolution of the video as well as its format. From the format drop-down, you can select SDR to convert your video to SDR.</li>
<li>Make sure you do not tap on <strong>Save;</strong> instead, click on the three dots again and tap on Save as Copy. This will leave your original HDR video untouched and save a copy for the SDR video.</li>

Viewers with HDR-compatible devices will see ‘HDR’ after every video quality option in the video settings (1080p HDR).</p>
<p>However, the videos uploaded as HDR on youtube can be viewed on HDR unsupported devices too. This happens because youtube automatically converts all HDR videos to SDR to be viewed on non-HDR devices. Here is a brief introduction to the steps of converting HDR to SDR on Youtube:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record the metadata by exporting it from an HDR-supported application like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

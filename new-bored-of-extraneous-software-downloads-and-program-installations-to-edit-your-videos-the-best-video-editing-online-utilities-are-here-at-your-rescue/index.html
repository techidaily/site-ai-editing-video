This company first came into being in 1950 by the name of “Photographic Analysis Company .”During the initial years, the company produced many cameras that could tackle the need for high-speed photography. However, in 1992, the company decided to create a separate entity to create high-speed cameras that wouldn’t depend on photographic film for imaging.</p>
<p>The US Patent Office acknowledged the use of innovative technology in the Phantom high-speed cameras. The main aim of this company is to produce robust cameras that can capture faster frame rates in high-speed photography. Many industries like defense, academia, and science research use <strong>Phantom slow-motion cameras</strong>. They are used in microfluidics, transparent flows, imaging, etc.</p>

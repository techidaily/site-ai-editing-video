<p>All these have pros and cons, but we recommend using <strong>“Video Compress”</strong> to compress your high-quality video on Android or iPhone. And why is that? Because not only does it support all video formats but also provides the function of trimming, cropping, or rotating the video. Moreover, it also allows the audio removal to increase the video’s compression further.</p>

</ul>

<li>No option for merging multiple videos into one</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the steps to compress video using Video Compress on Android phones.</p>
<p>Step1Download, Install and Launch the “Video Compress” from the AppStore.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Step2Open the folder containing the file, then select the video you want to compress.</p>
<p>Step3“Compress Video” will show you many options for editing your video. Press on the <strong>compress video</strong> option.</p>
<p><img

So if you took a high-quality 4K video from your mobile and are looking for a video compressor for Instagram, you don’t need to open your computer for this trivial matter. Because here are some of the best <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video compressor apps for android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video compressor apps for iOS. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>All these have pros and cons, but we recommend using <strong>“Video Compress”</strong> to compress your high-quality video on Android or iPhone. And why is that? Because not only does it support all video formats but also provides the function of trimming, cropping, or rotating the video. Moreover, it also allows the audio removal to increase the video’s compression further.</p>
<p>Here are some Pros and Cons of using “Video Compress”</p>
<p> Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Very simple to use</li>
<li>On top of adjusting the quality between low and high, you can also make custom settings</li>
<li>Can share the video directly from the app</li>
</ul>
<p> Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no search option; you must manually select the video from your storage</li>
<li>No option for merging multiple videos into one</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the steps to compress video using Video Compress on Android phones.</p>
<p>Step1Download, Install and Launch the “Video Compress” from the AppStore.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/compress-video-for-instagram-17.jpg"
                      alt="download video compress"
                ></p>
<p>Step2Open the folder containing the file, then select the video you want to compress.</p>
<p>Step3“Compress Video” will show you many options for editing your video. Press on the <strong>compress video</strong> option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/compress-video-for-instagram-18.jpg"
                      alt="press on compress video option"
                ></p>
<p>Step4Go to the Custom Settings and change the video resolution and bitrate to the ones recommended in Part 1 of this article.</p>
<p>Step5Finally, press the video compress icon on the bottom of the screen, and “Video Compress” will compress your video with the selected settings.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/compress-video-for-instagram-19.jpg"
                      alt="press on video compress icon"
                ></p>
<p>But there are some <strong>limitations,</strong> too, like it doesn’t change the aspect ratio and frame rate of the video, which are crucial for uploading it on Instagram. So we recommend using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you are looking for a video compressor for Instagram.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Compressing a high-quality video before uploading it on Instagram is necessary because of the concrete limitations of Instagram. In this article, we have gone over different video compressors for Instagram. Each of these video compressors can shrink the video without compromising its quality.

                      alt="Download and Import File"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Paste and Copy Video Parts</strong></p>
<p>Drag&#x2F;drop the imported file on the timeline, where you can stretch or zoom it. Now you can either play the video or move and stop the timeline marker where you wish to freeze the frame. After placing the marker, press S on the keyboard to split the video into two pieces. Then, copy and paste.</p>

                      alt="Copy and Paste"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reduce the Velocity to 0%.</strong></p>
<p>Right-click on the pasted video segment and choose Insert&#x2F;Remove Envelope&gt;Velocity from the context menu. It will draw a light green border around the pasted video segment. Set to 0 percent Velocity by right-clicking on that green box. It will freeze the extra part, making it look like a frozen frame.</p>

                      alt="Reduce Velocity"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Disconnect the audio</strong></p>
<p>You may also detach audio with Sony Vegas. Select the frozen frame and press U on the keyboard to cut the background audio of the frozen area. Remove the audio segment from the timeline by clicking on it and deleting it. You can pick Delete from the right-click drop-down menu or use the Delete key on your keyboard.</p>
<p>After that, attach the second part.</p>

<p>This cool effect enables you to show a dream-like scene where two mirrored footages appear within the same frame using the Masking feature. But why stop there?</p>
<p>Keep reading to find out how you can use this style of effect to spice up your daily vlog bumper intro or even for your upcoming sci-fi content.</p>

<h2 id="Preparing-the-footage"><a href="#Preparing-the-footage" class="headerlink" title="Preparing the footage"></a>Preparing the footage</h2><p>There are not many restrictions on preparing the footage for this effect. However, depending on the results you’re aiming for, you might need to consider a few things.</p>
<p>First, a wider view and some camera panning, or tilting will deliver a better result as it provides angle variations. This will later enhance the dynamic of the scene, making it feels even more uncanny.</p>
<p>Then, while you’re at it, you need to also figure out the purpose of the video itself. If you want to upload it to certain platforms where vertical videos are more popular, you will want to work on that as well. When you’re shooting your footage, make sure that you’re taking it at the correct angle that would fit the ratio you’re aiming for.</p>
<p>Last but not least, consider the length of the footage. If you’re planning to make a bumper video, you might want a quick yet comprehensive shot of the objects you want to highlight. You can always trim and adjust the timing later, but it is better to also plan it early.</p>

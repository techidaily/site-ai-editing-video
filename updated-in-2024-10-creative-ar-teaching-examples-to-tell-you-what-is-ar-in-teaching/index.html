<p>If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home&#x2F;office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> and the education sector.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education"><a href="#Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education" class="headerlink" title="Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education"></a>Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education</h2><h3 id="01No-Special-Equipment-Required"><a href="#01No-Special-Equipment-Required" class="headerlink" title="01No Special Equipment Required"></a>01No Special Equipment Required</h3><p>One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="02Better-Student-Engagement"><a href="#02Better-Student-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="02Better Student Engagement"></a>02Better Student Engagement</h3><p>Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.</p>
<h3 id="03Practical-Learning"><a href="#03Practical-Learning" class="headerlink" title="03Practical Learning"></a>03Practical Learning</h3><p>Another major advantage of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong> is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.</p>
<h3 id="04Combined-Learning"><a href="#04Combined-Learning" class="headerlink" title="04Combined Learning"></a>04Combined Learning</h3><p>Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With <strong>Augmented Reality in schools,</strong> students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.</p>
<h3 id="05Affordable"><a href="#05Affordable" class="headerlink" title="05Affordable"></a>05Affordable</h3><p>Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-10-Creative-AR-Teaching-Examples"><a href="#Part-3-10-Creative-AR-Teaching-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples"></a>Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples</h2><p>Now, even though it may seem a bit hard to digest, <strong>AR classrooms</strong> have already become a reality. The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview"><a href="#01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview" class="headerlink" title="01Exploring the Universe With Skyview"></a>01Exploring the Universe With Skyview</h3><p>Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?</p>

<h3 id="04Froggipedia"><a href="#04Froggipedia" class="headerlink" title="04Froggipedia"></a>04Froggipedia</h3><p>This is where things get interesting. Froggipedia is a great example of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong>. It’s basically a smartphone app that lets users explore the internal organs of a frog in a virtual environment. It means students would no longer have to get involved in the mess that dissecting an actual frog creates in the classroom and still get familiar with each organ easily.</p>

<h3 id="06Virtual-Classrooms"><a href="#06Virtual-Classrooms" class="headerlink" title="06Virtual Classrooms"></a>06Virtual Classrooms</h3><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has propelled the growth of virtual classrooms as many schools still haven’t resumed physical classes to restrict the virus’s spread. In VR classrooms, mixed reality - a combination of VR and AR - can help students stay engaged, even if they are sitting apart from each other. Virtual Classrooms will eliminate boredom from remote learning and keep the engagement level high for students.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="07Secure-Training"><a href="#07Secure-Training" class="headerlink" title="07Secure Training"></a>07Secure Training</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, AR integration makes training more effective and risk-free. For example, with Microsoft Holo-lens, medical students understand the inner anatomy of the human body and understand complex procedures without having to risk a patient’s life. Once they are confident and know about each organ, they can move towards the next procedure and gain expertise in the particular domain more effectively.</p>
<h3 id="08Google-Expeditions"><a href="#08Google-Expeditions" class="headerlink" title="08Google Expeditions"></a>08Google Expeditions</h3><p>For a student, exploring the world is a great way to familiarize himself with different cultures. But, it’s not always possible for young kids to go on trips alone. Well, not anymore! Thanks to virtual tour platforms like Google Expeditions, teachers can take their students on virtual trips to different corners of the world, be it Mount Everest Base Camp or the Eiffel Tower in Paris.</p>

<h3 id="09Augmented-Reality-in-Museums"><a href="#09Augmented-Reality-in-Museums" class="headerlink" title="09Augmented Reality in Museums"></a>09Augmented Reality in Museums</h3><p>The younger generation craves interactivity. They don’t have the time to read brochures in a Museum. That’s the reason why many Museums have started to launch AR-powered tech to keep the visitors engaged and let them learn various historical facts more precisely. For instance, in a nature-themed museum, visitors can experience digital animals and their position in history.</p>
<h3 id="10Virtual-Speech"><a href="#10Virtual-Speech" class="headerlink" title="10Virtual Speech"></a>10Virtual Speech</h3><p>Not particularly an Augmented Reality (AR) example, Virtual Speech is a combination of AR and VR that lets users virtually practice their public speaking skills without going on a real stage. This is a great tool to fight stage fear and speak with confidence in front of an actual crowd.</p>

<p>In the recent few years, Augmented Reality (AR) has evolved from a sci-fi concept to one of the most prominent technologies in the world. Due to its vast applications, AR has already seeped into many industries and the education world is one of them. <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> can do wonders for the kids and enhance the overall learning experience. Not to mention, by combining AR with other intuitive technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR), teachers can uplift the entire learning experience for students and make boring topics slightly more intriguing.</p>
<p>The truth is that conventional teaching methods are now becoming obsolete and many educational institutes and universities are incorporating AR to make teaching more fun. Keeping that in mind, we are going to share a detailed insight into how AR integration can help the entire edtech world. We’ll also share some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality (AR) in teaching</strong> so that you can understand its benefits in the education sector.</p>

Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.</p>

<p>If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home&#x2F;office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> and the education sector.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-2"><a href="#Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education"></a>Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education</h2><h3 id="01No-Special-Equipment-Required-2"><a href="#01No-Special-Equipment-Required-2" class="headerlink" title="01No Special Equipment Required"></a>01No Special Equipment Required</h3><p>One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="02Better-Student-Engagement-2"><a href="#02Better-Student-Engagement-2" class="headerlink" title="02Better Student Engagement"></a>02Better Student Engagement</h3><p>Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.</p>
<h3 id="03Practical-Learning-2"><a href="#03Practical-Learning-2" class="headerlink" title="03Practical Learning"></a>03Practical Learning</h3><p>Another major advantage of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong> is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.</p>
<h3 id="04Combined-Learning-2"><a href="#04Combined-Learning-2" class="headerlink" title="04Combined Learning"></a>04Combined Learning</h3><p>Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With <strong>Augmented Reality in schools,</strong> students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.</p>
<h3 id="05Affordable-2"><a href="#05Affordable-2" class="headerlink" title="05Affordable"></a>05Affordable</h3><p>Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.</p>

<p>In the recent few years, Augmented Reality (AR) has evolved from a sci-fi concept to one of the most prominent technologies in the world. Due to its vast applications, AR has already seeped into many industries and the education world is one of them. <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> can do wonders for the kids and enhance the overall learning experience. Not to mention, by combining AR with other intuitive technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR), teachers can uplift the entire learning experience for students and make boring topics slightly more intriguing.</p>
<p>The truth is that conventional teaching methods are now becoming obsolete and many educational institutes and universities are incorporating AR to make teaching more fun. Keeping that in mind, we are going to share a detailed insight into how AR integration can help the entire edtech world. We’ll also share some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality (AR) in teaching</strong> so that you can understand its benefits in the education sector.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-AR-in-Teaching-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-AR-in-Teaching-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is AR in Teaching?"></a>Part 1 What Is AR in Teaching?</h2><p>For readers who are not familiar with Augmented Reality, here’s what you need to know. Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.</p>

<p>If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home&#x2F;office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> and the education sector.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-3"><a href="#Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education"></a>Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education</h2><h3 id="01No-Special-Equipment-Required-3"><a href="#01No-Special-Equipment-Required-3" class="headerlink" title="01No Special Equipment Required"></a>01No Special Equipment Required</h3><p>One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="02Better-Student-Engagement-3"><a href="#02Better-Student-Engagement-3" class="headerlink" title="02Better Student Engagement"></a>02Better Student Engagement</h3><p>Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.</p>
<h3 id="03Practical-Learning-3"><a href="#03Practical-Learning-3" class="headerlink" title="03Practical Learning"></a>03Practical Learning</h3><p>Another major advantage of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong> is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.</p>
<h3 id="04Combined-Learning-3"><a href="#04Combined-Learning-3" class="headerlink" title="04Combined Learning"></a>04Combined Learning</h3><p>Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With <strong>Augmented Reality in schools,</strong> students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.</p>
<h3 id="05Affordable-3"><a href="#05Affordable-3" class="headerlink" title="05Affordable"></a>05Affordable</h3><p>Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-10-Creative-AR-Teaching-Examples-3"><a href="#Part-3-10-Creative-AR-Teaching-Examples-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples"></a>Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples</h2><p>Now, even though it may seem a bit hard to digest, <strong>AR classrooms</strong> have already become a reality. The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview-3"><a href="#01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview-3" class="headerlink" title="01Exploring the Universe With Skyview"></a>01Exploring the Universe With Skyview</h3><p>Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?</p>

It converts moving pictures into still photography for some time. These video editor effects help filmmakers gear attention to the video editing or filmmaking process. In other words, they are self-reflexive.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> At the beginning of a movie&#x2F;video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience’s interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This <strong>freeze-frame</strong> technique was used in the film ‘Good Fellas’ to pique the audience’s interests.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The ‘breakfast club’ filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie ‘The Departed.’</p>

It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.</p>
<p>But several movie directors have effectively used the <strong>freeze-frame</strong> video editing technique that wowed the audience.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the best <strong>freeze frame examples</strong> you would love;</p>
<h3 id="01The-Departed"><a href="#01The-Departed" class="headerlink" title="01The Departed"></a>01<strong>The Departed</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="The Departed"
                ></p>
<p>In this 2006 movie, an undercover cop and a mole try to identify each other. Scorsese shows his editing prowess once again as he uses freeze-frame more subtly.</p>
<p>He changes the frame speed instead of stopping on one frame for a considerably longer time. This emphasizes some memorable moments that you may overlook on a first watch.</p>
<h3 id="02Rocky-III"><a href="#02Rocky-III" class="headerlink" title="02Rocky III"></a>02<strong>Rocky III</strong></h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-2.jpg"
                      alt="Rocky III"
                ></p>
<p>The <strong>freeze-frame</strong> came in during the final match between Apollo and Balboa in this movie.</p>
<p>During the first 3 Rocky movies, Apollo and Balboa had an intriguing rivalry. At the end of Rocky III, the duo decides to engage in a friendly battle to determine who was the Lord in boxing.</p>
<p>The movie ends in a freeze-frame with Rocky swinging a right hook after Apollo imitates the bell, saying, “Ding Dong.”</p>
<p>The freeze-frame allows the audience to guess who the winner will be, thus a longer time to think of the movie after watching.</p>
<h3 id="03400-Blows"><a href="#03400-Blows" class="headerlink" title="03400 Blows"></a>03<strong>400 Blows</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="400 blows"
                ></p>
<p>In 400 Blows, the main character Antoine, a young Parisian, was hardly out of trouble.</p>
<p>In an attempt to end his troubles, he arrives at the beach after running away from a soccer match.</p>
<p>He is faced with either jumping right in or going back. The movie ends in a freeze-frame as no one finds out. The decision was left to the audience.</p>
<h3 id="04Thelma-and-Louise"><a href="#04Thelma-and-Louise" class="headerlink" title="04Thelma and Louise"></a>04<strong>Thelma and Louise</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Thelma and Louise"
                ></p>
<p>Thelma and Louise is about two (2) friends, Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer. They both rise to defend themselves in a male-dominated world. In the film, Thelma and Louise are both running from the authorities. Louise killed a man who almost raped her friend, Thelma, thus the run. Things get out of control as they try to escape to Mexico, away from the authorities.</p>
<p>While on the run, they get ambushed by the police towards the grand canyon. The audience, at this point, is in suspense as to whether the ladies will survive or not.</p>
<p>Instead of surrendering, they drive right into the grand canyon, and the movie ends in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> as they get caught hanging in the air while plunging into the canyon.</p>
<p>Regular movies might decide to give us all the details of the car plunging and exploding.</p>
<h3 id="05The-Wolf-of-Wall-Street"><a href="#05The-Wolf-of-Wall-Street" class="headerlink" title="05The Wolf of Wall Street"></a>05<strong>The Wolf of Wall Street</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="The wolf of wall street"
                ></p>
<p>Scorsese uses freeze-frame at the beginning of this movie, just as he did in Good Fellas. The freeze-frame effect here helps introduce the character and shows us the plot of the movie hence piquing the audience’s interests immediately.</p>
<h3 id="06Out-of-Sight"><a href="#06Out-of-Sight" class="headerlink" title="06Out of Sight"></a>06<strong>Out of Sight</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Out of Sight"
                ></p>
<p>This movie is another excellent example of <strong>freeze-frame</strong> video editing. What other way to pique the audience’s interest significantly and emphasize them than capture them in a freeze-frame.</p>
<h3 id="07Death-Proof"><a href="#07Death-Proof" class="headerlink" title="07Death Proof"></a>07<strong>Death Proof</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Death Proof"
                ></p>
<p>In this movie, the freeze-frame stays till the very end. It captures three women as they raise their hands-on celebration after successfully beating to death a psychopath who has been killing young women.</p>
<h3 id="08Butch-Cassidy-and-the-Sundance-Kid"><a href="#08Butch-Cassidy-and-the-Sundance-Kid" class="headerlink" title="08Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"></a>08<strong>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Butch Cassidy and Sundance kid"
                ></p>
<p>This movie follows two train robbers, Butch Cassidy and Harry Longabaugh, known as the ‘Sundance Kid.’ After conducting several robberies, they go on the run as the authorities pursue them. After a gun battle with the authorities, they take cover inside a building, but they get surrounded with no other escape route.</p>
<p>Thus they decide to engage in the last fight instead of surrendering, and you see them in a gun battle with the authorities. The movie ends with them caught in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> brandishing their guns at the officers instead of actual bloodshed. Though we all know they will get killed.</p>
<h3 id="09Good-Fellas"><a href="#09Good-Fellas" class="headerlink" title="09Good Fellas"></a>09<strong>Good Fellas</strong></h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Good fellas"
                ></p>
<p>Initially, we mentioned that a freeze-frame could be of use at the beginning of a movie. Scorsese used this effectively in ‘Good Fellas’ to emphasize the movie plot.</p>
<p>In the opening scene, the characters Henry, Jimmy, and Tonny, played by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci, respectively, stop their car in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>They open their truck and see a man badly wounded and beaten, Tonny stabs him, and Jimmy shoots him. Henry then closes the truck and looks on in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> before uttering the lines, “As far back as I can remember, I have always wanted to be a gangster.”</p>
<p>This lets us know right away what will happen in the movie. That person will get killed, and this is the mob territory.</p>
<h3 id="10Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban"><a href="#10Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban" class="headerlink" title="10Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"></a>10<strong>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Hardy Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban"
                ></p>
<p>During a bad and weird year at Hogwarts, Harry potter experiences an extremely joyous moment when he goes anti-gravity on his new Firebolt broom.</p>
<p>He becomes overjoyed and his expression gets captured in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="11The-Breakfast-Club"><a href="#11The-Breakfast-Club" class="headerlink" title="11The Breakfast Club"></a>11<strong>The Breakfast Club</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="The Breakfast Club"
                ></p>
<p>The Breakfast Club is an 80s movie showing teenagers trying to find their identity in life and overcoming the challenges of these years.</p>
<p>This is another <strong>freeze frame example</strong> where the filmmakers showed great expertise. The character John Bender is caught in a <strong>freeze-frame,</strong> punching the air to celebrate his victory.</p>
<p>He has just shared a kiss with the class sweetheart Claire. He and his classmates have also just won over the authoritative principal, Mr. Vernon.</p>
<h3 id="12Pulp-Fiction-Pumpkin-and-Honey-Bunny"><a href="#12Pulp-Fiction-Pumpkin-and-Honey-Bunny" class="headerlink" title="12Pulp Fiction: Pumpkin and Honey Bunny."></a>12<strong>Pulp Fiction: Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Pulp Fiction"
                ></p>
<p>Pulp Fiction is another movie such as ‘Good Fellas’ with its freeze-frame edition done at the movie’s beginning.</p>
<p>Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are shown at the movie’s beginning, sitting together in a diner. They argue whether it will be safer to rub a bank or a restaurant. In the end, they settle for a diner — the same one they are sitting in.</p>
<p>They kiss and pull out their guns, and the images freeze before the credits roll out.</p>
<p>The <strong>freeze-frame</strong> gives us a sneak peek of the violence to experience in the movie, and indeed, we were not disappointed.</p>

Things get out of control as they try to escape to Mexico, away from the authorities.</p>
<p>While on the run, they get ambushed by the police towards the grand canyon. The audience, at this point, is in suspense as to whether the ladies will survive or not.</p>
<p>Instead of surrendering, they drive right into the grand canyon, and the movie ends in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> as they get caught hanging in the air while plunging into the canyon.</p>

In other words, they are self-reflexive.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> At the beginning of a movie&#x2F;video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience’s interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This <strong>freeze-frame</strong> technique was used in the film ‘Good Fellas’ to pique the audience’s interests.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The ‘breakfast club’ filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie ‘The Departed.’</p>

<p>Pulp Fiction is another movie such as ‘Good Fellas’ with its freeze-frame edition done at the movie’s beginning.</p>
<p>Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are shown at the movie’s beginning, sitting together in a diner. They argue whether it will be safer to rub a bank or a restaurant. In the end, they settle for a diner — the same one they are sitting in.</p>
<p>They kiss and pull out their guns, and the images freeze before the credits roll out.</p>
<p>The <strong>freeze-frame</strong> gives us a sneak peek of the violence to experience in the movie, and indeed, we were not disappointed.</p>

<p><strong>Freeze frame</strong> effect in video editing is a skill that requires more practice to master. It adds drama and impact to movies. If you want to see more energy and acting in the videos you watch, then you should see more freeze-frame examples.</p>
<p>Sometimes we notice that a particular action stays on longer than necessary in a movie or video. The filmmakers use this skill to emphasize some intense moments further to sustain or pique your interest.</p>
<p>The <strong>freeze-frame</strong> video editing feature is a valuable skill that helps filmmakers make excellent movies. We have a list of the top 12 examples of freeze-frame effects in movies for you.</p>

It converts moving pictures into still photography for some time. These video editor effects help filmmakers gear attention to the video editing or filmmaking process. In other words, they are self-reflexive.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Ways-to-Use-Freeze-Frame-in-Video-editing-3"><a href="#Part-2-Ways-to-Use-Freeze-Frame-in-Video-editing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Ways to Use Freeze Frame in Video editing"></a>Part 2 <strong>Ways to Use Freeze Frame in Video editing</strong></h2><p>Freeze frames can be helpful in 3 significant ways in video editing;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> At the beginning of a movie&#x2F;video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience’s interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This <strong>freeze-frame</strong> technique was used in the film ‘Good Fellas’ to pique the audience’s interests.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The ‘breakfast club’ filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie ‘The Departed.’</p>

It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.</p>
<p>But several movie directors have effectively used the <strong>freeze-frame</strong> video editing technique that wowed the audience.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the best <strong>freeze frame examples</strong> you would love;</p>
<h3 id="01The-Departed-3"><a href="#01The-Departed-3" class="headerlink" title="01The Departed"></a>01<strong>The Departed</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="The Departed"
                ></p>
<p>In this 2006 movie, an undercover cop and a mole try to identify each other. Scorsese shows his editing prowess once again as he uses freeze-frame more subtly.</p>
<p>He changes the frame speed instead of stopping on one frame for a considerably longer time. This emphasizes some memorable moments that you may overlook on a first watch.</p>
<h3 id="02Rocky-III-3"><a href="#02Rocky-III-3" class="headerlink" title="02Rocky III"></a>02<strong>Rocky III</strong></h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-2.jpg"
                      alt="Rocky III"
                ></p>
<p>The <strong>freeze-frame</strong> came in during the final match between Apollo and Balboa in this movie.</p>
<p>During the first 3 Rocky movies, Apollo and Balboa had an intriguing rivalry. At the end of Rocky III, the duo decides to engage in a friendly battle to determine who was the Lord in boxing.</p>
<p>The movie ends in a freeze-frame with Rocky swinging a right hook after Apollo imitates the bell, saying, “Ding Dong.”</p>
<p>The freeze-frame allows the audience to guess who the winner will be, thus a longer time to think of the movie after watching.</p>
<h3 id="03400-Blows-3"><a href="#03400-Blows-3" class="headerlink" title="03400 Blows"></a>03<strong>400 Blows</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="400 blows"
                ></p>
<p>In 400 Blows, the main character Antoine, a young Parisian, was hardly out of trouble.</p>
<p>In an attempt to end his troubles, he arrives at the beach after running away from a soccer match.</p>
<p>He is faced with either jumping right in or going back. The movie ends in a freeze-frame as no one finds out. The decision was left to the audience.</p>
<h3 id="04Thelma-and-Louise-3"><a href="#04Thelma-and-Louise-3" class="headerlink" title="04Thelma and Louise"></a>04<strong>Thelma and Louise</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Thelma and Louise"
                ></p>
<p>Thelma and Louise is about two (2) friends, Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer. They both rise to defend themselves in a male-dominated world. In the film, Thelma and Louise are both running from the authorities. Louise killed a man who almost raped her friend, Thelma, thus the run. Things get out of control as they try to escape to Mexico, away from the authorities.</p>
<p>While on the run, they get ambushed by the police towards the grand canyon. The audience, at this point, is in suspense as to whether the ladies will survive or not.</p>
<p>Instead of surrendering, they drive right into the grand canyon, and the movie ends in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> as they get caught hanging in the air while plunging into the canyon.</p>
<p>Regular movies might decide to give us all the details of the car plunging and exploding.</p>
<h3 id="05The-Wolf-of-Wall-Street-3"><a href="#05The-Wolf-of-Wall-Street-3" class="headerlink" title="05The Wolf of Wall Street"></a>05<strong>The Wolf of Wall Street</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="The wolf of wall street"
                ></p>
<p>Scorsese uses freeze-frame at the beginning of this movie, just as he did in Good Fellas. The freeze-frame effect here helps introduce the character and shows us the plot of the movie hence piquing the audience’s interests immediately.</p>
<h3 id="06Out-of-Sight-3"><a href="#06Out-of-Sight-3" class="headerlink" title="06Out of Sight"></a>06<strong>Out of Sight</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Out of Sight"
                ></p>
<p>This movie is another excellent example of <strong>freeze-frame</strong> video editing. What other way to pique the audience’s interest significantly and emphasize them than capture them in a freeze-frame.</p>
<h3 id="07Death-Proof-3"><a href="#07Death-Proof-3" class="headerlink" title="07Death Proof"></a>07<strong>Death Proof</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Death Proof"
                ></p>
<p>In this movie, the freeze-frame stays till the very end. It captures three women as they raise their hands-on celebration after successfully beating to death a psychopath who has been killing young women.</p>
<h3 id="08Butch-Cassidy-and-the-Sundance-Kid-3"><a href="#08Butch-Cassidy-and-the-Sundance-Kid-3" class="headerlink" title="08Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"></a>08<strong>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Butch Cassidy and Sundance kid"
                ></p>
<p>This movie follows two train robbers, Butch Cassidy and Harry Longabaugh, known as the ‘Sundance Kid.’ After conducting several robberies, they go on the run as the authorities pursue them. After a gun battle with the authorities, they take cover inside a building, but they get surrounded with no other escape route.</p>
<p>Thus they decide to engage in the last fight instead of surrendering, and you see them in a gun battle with the authorities. The movie ends with them caught in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> brandishing their guns at the officers instead of actual bloodshed. Though we all know they will get killed.</p>
<h3 id="09Good-Fellas-3"><a href="#09Good-Fellas-3" class="headerlink" title="09Good Fellas"></a>09<strong>Good Fellas</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Good fellas"
                ></p>
<p>Initially, we mentioned that a freeze-frame could be of use at the beginning of a movie. Scorsese used this effectively in ‘Good Fellas’ to emphasize the movie plot.</p>
<p>In the opening scene, the characters Henry, Jimmy, and Tonny, played by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci, respectively, stop their car in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>They open their truck and see a man badly wounded and beaten, Tonny stabs him, and Jimmy shoots him. Henry then closes the truck and looks on in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> before uttering the lines, “As far back as I can remember, I have always wanted to be a gangster.”</p>
<p>This lets us know right away what will happen in the movie. That person will get killed, and this is the mob territory.</p>

<p>During a bad and weird year at Hogwarts, Harry potter experiences an extremely joyous moment when he goes anti-gravity on his new Firebolt broom.</p>
<p>He becomes overjoyed and his expression gets captured in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong>.</p>

<p>The Breakfast Club is an 80s movie showing teenagers trying to find their identity in life and overcoming the challenges of these years.</p>
<p>This is another <strong>freeze frame example</strong> where the filmmakers showed great expertise. The character John Bender is caught in a <strong>freeze-frame,</strong> punching the air to celebrate his victory.</p>
<p>He has just shared a kiss with the class sweetheart Claire. He and his classmates have also just won over the authoritative principal, Mr. Vernon.</p>

The cue behind these backgrounds is that they exclusively permit the object of focus to have an opaque or colored pixelation, while leaving the remaining pixels as transparent or colorless. This is beneficial in adding an extra spotlight to the main elements of your creation, while rendering the less important parts behind the scene.</p>
<p>Having known the credibility of transparent backgrounds in video crafting, you may feel motivated to try hands on experimenting with transparent backgrounds to uplift your graphic motion artwork.</p>
<p>Considering the most affordable picks of video editing software to choose from, you can rely on the ‘After Effects’ motion graphic template to kick start the creation process. When using the aforesaid template to export videos with transparent backgrounds, you need to adhere to the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Launch the After Effects Template</strong></p>
<p>Start with downloading the graphic template from its official website and launching the same on your system.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select Your Video</strong></p>
<p>On a successful launch, the template welcomes you with its composition timeline and project panel. Here, you need to select a desired video from either of the two places to export with a transparent background.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add to Queue</strong></p>
<p>Once you have made your choice, navigate to the top toolbar in the composition panel and hit the ‘Composition’ tab. From the drop down menu that follows, choose ‘Add to Render Queue’. You can alternatively use the ‘Ctrl + M’ shortcut to carry out the above task.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Make Your Film Ready</strong></p>

<p>Having known the credibility of transparent backgrounds in video crafting, you may feel motivated to try hands on experimenting with transparent backgrounds to uplift your graphic motion artwork.</p>

<p>Once you have made your choice, navigate to the top toolbar in the composition panel and hit the ‘Composition’ tab. From the drop down menu that follows, choose ‘Add to Render Queue’. You can alternatively use the ‘Ctrl + M’ shortcut to carry out the above task.</p>

It extends to the usage of photos and the creation of photo collages using these photos. Microsoft Word has the right features which you can easily use to organize pictures and photos in a certain way to make a photo collage. The <strong>collage maker Microsoft</strong> is not a hard operation to access if one knows the various options and operations of Microsoft Word well. There are different versions of Microsoft Word, all of which serve the same purposes but have different options and different icons representing various features. No matter which version you are using, the primary process of creating remains the same in all of those processes as it is simply the collection of the desired pictures, deciding on a particular shape and dimension of the page where you will arrange the pictures, inserting the pictures into the page, and then arranging them in a certain order.</p>
<p>Up until now, Microsoft has launched more than ten versions of Microsoft Word, with the preliminary ones being named “Microsoft Office”. In recent times, the newer version of Microsoft Word has become more user-friendly and thus it has become easier to perform so-called more complex tasks with the software, such as the creation of photo collages. With the addition of options and features to each newer version of Microsoft Word, it has become easier to work with graphics and arrange them or resize them or edit them in the desired way. More templates have been included in the newer versions to make it easy for the users to come to a decision when it comes to the shape of the collage and the number of pictures in it. Thus, it has various <strong>collage Microsoft Word</strong> options available now, which make the job much easier. There are a variety of options that are offered by the newer versions of Microsoft Word which will surely greatly help the user in creating photo collages as they open up the path to more features.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The difference has been in the quality and the quantity of the features that each of the new versions of Microsoft Word contains. For example, the older versions were predominantly used for text, and thus, there were not any viable options for pictures and arranging them, and creating a collage. The newer versions of Microsoft Word have sections and options entirely dedicated to the creation of collages and thus contain special <strong>Microsoft collage maker</strong> options which make it much easier to arrange pictures in certain ways and create collages. For example, the newer versions consist of features such as ‘SmartArt” which is a built-in feature to create collages in Microsoft Word. It is available in the newer versions of Word. ‘SmartArt” works as a <strong>Microsoft auto collage</strong> option.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The 2013 and 2016 versions of Microsoft Word also contain something called the ‘Developer” option, which can be accessed from the ‘Customizing the Ribbon” section. You can use it to specify the number of pictures and then insert pictures from a file. There is also the option of using Word Tables which can be used in any version of Microsoft Word to create a certain arrangement for your photo collage. Word Tables give the user complete control over the layout of the collage and this makes it easier for the user to arrange the pictures of the collage.</p>

<p>Up until now, Microsoft has launched more than ten versions of Microsoft Word, with the preliminary ones being named “Microsoft Office”. In recent times, the newer version of Microsoft Word has become more user-friendly and thus it has become easier to perform so-called more complex tasks with the software, such as the creation of photo collages. With the addition of options and features to each newer version of Microsoft Word, it has become easier to work with graphics and arrange them or resize them or edit them in the desired way. More templates have been included in the newer versions to make it easy for the users to come to a decision when it comes to the shape of the collage and the number of pictures in it.

<p>The difference has been in the quality and the quantity of the features that each of the new versions of Microsoft Word contains. For example, the older versions were predominantly used for text, and thus, there were not any viable options for pictures and arranging them, and creating a collage. The newer versions of Microsoft Word have sections and options entirely dedicated to the creation of collages and thus contain special <strong>Microsoft collage maker</strong> options which make it much easier to arrange pictures in certain ways and create collages. For example, the newer versions consist of features such as ‘SmartArt” which is a built-in feature to create collages in Microsoft Word. It is available in the newer versions of Word. ‘SmartArt” works as a <strong>Microsoft auto collage</strong> option.</p>

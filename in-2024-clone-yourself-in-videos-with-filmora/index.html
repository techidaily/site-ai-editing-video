Whether you’re looking to create a funny skit or a serious video, cloning yourself can add much production value to your project.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll walk you through the process of how to clone yourself in videos using Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Film-Clips-for-Cloning-Effects"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Film-Clips-for-Cloning-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Film Clips for Cloning Effects?"></a>Part 1: How to Film Clips for Cloning Effects?</h2><p>To make cloning effects, you will need to take two different shots and use a tripod to place the camera, so the frame doesn’t change.</p>
<p><strong>Shooting the first clip</strong></p>
<p>For the first shot, stay on one side of the frame and do the first action. For example, you can pretend to yank and take off your jacket. Then, drop the jacket to the other side of the frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-1.gif"
                      alt="shooting the first clip"
                ></p>
<p>To make it more realistic, make an interaction by reacting to the “clone” while facing the other direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-2.jpg"
                      alt="make an interaction"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Shooting the second clip</strong></p>
<p>Then, shoot for the second clip without changing the frame. You will have to go to the place where you dropped the jacket from the first shot.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-3.gif"
                      alt="shooting the second clip"
                ></p>
<p>Act as if you have just appeared there and give a reaction to the other side as well.</p>

If you haven’t installed Filmora yet, you can go to their website and download it here:</p>

<p>Once you have opened Filmora 11, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Step1 Bring the first clip to the timeline and cut the clip where you pretend to yank and take off the jacket. Select and delete the unnecessary clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-4.jpg"
                      alt="bring the first clip to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 After you have the first part of the effect ready, let’s start working on the clone part using masking.</p>
<p>First, place the second clip on a different window track, and the starting point is where you react to the “clone.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-5.jpg"
                      alt="place the second clip on a different window track"
                ></p>
<p>Then, double-click the second clip and go to the Filmora setting window. Tap on the <strong>Mask</strong> section &gt; <strong>Single line</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-6.jpg"
                      alt="tap on mask section"
                ></p>
<p>On the preview screen, adjust the position of the mask to only show “the clone.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-7.gif"
                      alt="adjust the position of the mask"
                ></p>
<p>Set the blur strength on the setting to make a smoother edge transition.</p>
<p>Step3 If the timing of the two clips doesn’t match, you can fix it using the speed ramping feature on Filmora 11. To use it, double-click the second clip and select <strong>Speed &gt; Speed Ramping &gt; Customize</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-8.jpg"
                      alt="double-click the second clip"
                ></p>
<p>Move the keyframe up to increase the speed. You can adjust it according to your needs.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-9.gif"
                      alt="adjust keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Once you are satisfied, adjust the clip length on the timeline and make sure that both clips finish at the same time.</p>

<p>Once you have opened Filmora 11, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Step1 Bring the first clip to the timeline and cut the clip where you pretend to yank and take off the jacket. Select and delete the unnecessary clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-4.jpg"
                      alt="bring the first clip to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 After you have the first part of the effect ready, let’s start working on the clone part using masking.</p>
<p>First, place the second clip on a different window track, and the starting point is where you react to the “clone.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-5.jpg"
                      alt="place the second clip on a different window track"
                ></p>
<p>Then, double-click the second clip and go to the Filmora setting window. Tap on the <strong>Mask</strong> section &gt; <strong>Single line</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-6.jpg"
                      alt="tap on mask section"
                ></p>
<p>On the preview screen, adjust the position of the mask to only show “the clone.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-7.gif"
                      alt="adjust the position of the mask"
                ></p>
<p>Set the blur strength on the setting to make a smoother edge transition.</p>
<p>Step3 If the timing of the two clips doesn’t match, you can fix it using the speed ramping feature on Filmora 11. To use it, double-click the second clip and select <strong>Speed &gt; Speed Ramping &gt; Customize</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-8.jpg"
                      alt="double-click the second clip"
                ></p>
<p>Move the keyframe up to increase the speed. You can adjust it according to your needs.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-9.gif"
                      alt="adjust keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Once you are satisfied, adjust the clip length on the timeline and make sure that both clips finish at the same time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-10.jpg"
                      alt="adjust the clip length"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Extra tip:</strong> Add one more effect to make it more magical.</p>
<p>Step1 Open the <strong>Effects</strong> window and search for “up down 1.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="open the effects window"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Drag and drop the effect onto the timeline where the first cut is set. Adjust the effect length to match the action.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="drag and drop the effect onto the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Then, drag and drop the effect again in the transition between the first and the second clip. Adjust it to the appropriate length, then it will give a more dramatic effect.</p>

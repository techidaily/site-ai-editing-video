Therefore, ensure that we have camera movement in the same direction during all recording times.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can film the video either in the vertical format of the camera or in horizontal format. It all depends upon your script!</p>
<p>Follow the below-mentioned steps to record the first footage for the video:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold the camera in a perfect format, whatever you choose.</li>
<li>Let the subject stand or sit in the middle of the frame.</li>
<li>The filmmaker can rotate the camera when the subject’s hand rotates.</li>
<li>Try your best to rotate the camera 180 degrees.</li>
<li>Ensure that the camera lens faces the ground at the end of the rotation.</li>
</ul>

Follow the below steps to record it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step is to hold the camera in the same direction as the first footage.</li>
<li>When editing, make sure the subject’s position matches the first footage.</li>
<li>Make sure the subject’s hand movement is in the opposite direction from the first shot.</li>

<p><strong>Frame blending</strong> is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.</p>
<p>When <strong>frame blending</strong> is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.</p>
<p>Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Frame Sampling:</strong> best for smooth movements, no image distortion.</li>

<p><strong>Frame blending</strong> is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.</p>
<p>When <strong>frame blending</strong> is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.</p>
<p>Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.</p>

<p><strong>Frame blending</strong> is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.</p>
<p>When <strong>frame blending</strong> is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.</p>
<p>Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.</p>

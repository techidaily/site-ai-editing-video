<p>The simplest things around us have become more exciting and fun to deal with. The mere mode of communication has shifted to the digital platform and has improved so much than before. We can now express how we feel through the different emotions as precisely as possible.</p>
<p>And adding to that, now, we have the GIFs to make our conversation funnier and more engaging. So, what if we integrate these <strong>gifs in slideshows</strong>? It will be much more exciting and a huge plus point. So, let us look into what are GIFs, how can we use them and lastly, what tool is the best for creating some fantastic and amazing GIFs and videos.</p>

Firstly, GIF is the abbreviation for Graphics Interchange Format. Steve Wilhite, an American computer scantiest, was responsible for developing this bitmap image format with the team at the online services provider CompuServe.</p>

<p>In your browser, you can set the <em>‘In</em> and <em>Out’</em> points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.</p>
<p>After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the <em>‘Trim tool’.</em> Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip’s endings.</p>
<p>If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.</p>
<p>To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title and Texts</strong>: Final Cut Pro has many Titles located in the browser where you imported your media. You can add them by dragging them into your video’s timeline. To access those titles you can press the <em>‘Title and Generators’</em> icon in the sidebar to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions</strong>: When adding Transitions, there is nothing wrong with a “<em>hard cut_” between 2 clips. Use the transitions only where they make sense so as not to ruin your video. To add these transitions, you need to open the ‘_Transition browser’</em> by clicking on its indicated icon.</p>
<p>The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘<em>Command + 4’</em> and make the adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘<em>Effects browser’</em> icon to open it.</p>
<p>Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio &amp; Music:</strong> At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.</p>
<p>To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word <em>‘Jingle</em>‘ and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.</p>
<p><strong>Color correction</strong>: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.</p>
<p>Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.</p>
<p>To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or <em>‘Option + Cmd + B’</em>.</p>
<p>Now that you are done editing your video, you can save and share as you prefer.</p>

<p>Editing video with Final Cut Pro is not a complicated process. Here are the steps to help a beginner get started.</p>
<p><strong>Step1: Create a new project &amp; import media</strong></p>
<p>When you Launch the Final Cut Pro interface, Libraries and Events are automatically created. You only need to create a new project.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar, click <em>File &gt; New &gt; Project</em> to create a new project. Here you will have to type in a new name of the project and then select ‘<em>Use Automatic Settings’</em>.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar again, click <em>File &gt; Import &gt; Media</em> to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.</p>
<p>After selecting all the media you want to include in your project press <em>‘Import Selected’</em> and then close the media window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.</strong></p>
<p>The thumbnails of all the media you have imported will be appearing in the browser. For you to create a new video you need to arrange and trim that media in the timeline.</p>
<p>In your browser, you can set the <em>‘In</em> and <em>Out’</em> points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.</p>
<p>After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the <em>‘Trim tool’.</em> Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip’s endings.</p>
<p>If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.</p>
<p>To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title and Texts</strong>: Final Cut Pro has many Titles located in the browser where you imported your media. You can add them by dragging them into your video’s timeline. To access those titles you can press the <em>‘Title and Generators’</em> icon in the sidebar to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions</strong>: When adding Transitions, there is nothing wrong with a “<em>hard cut_” between 2 clips. Use the transitions only where they make sense so as not to ruin your video. To add these transitions, you need to open the ‘_Transition browser’</em> by clicking on its indicated icon.</p>
<p>The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘<em>Command + 4’</em> and make the adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘<em>Effects browser’</em> icon to open it.</p>
<p>Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio &amp; Music:</strong> At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.</p>
<p>To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word <em>‘Jingle</em>‘ and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.</p>
<p><strong>Color correction</strong>: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.</p>
<p>Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.</p>
<p>To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or <em>‘Option + Cmd + B’</em>.</p>
<p>Now that you are done editing your video, you can save and share as you prefer.</p>

<p>These steps will help you to know how to edit video with Filmora software;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Start a new project.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-01.png"
                      alt="filmora start new project"
                ></p>
<p>After making sure that you have Filmora video editor installed on your computer, start a new project. Open the app then choose a dropdown option from the Select Project Aspect Ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import your media</strong></p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-02.png"
                      alt="filmora import media"
                ></p>
<p>The footage, photos, and audios you use in your video are the key basic aspects of your video. Organizing all the files you are going to use in a single file. You can do this by browsing the file menu. Click the <em>‘File &gt; Import Media Folder’</em> menu in Filmora and select the folder that contains your video files.</p>
<p>After importing your video files the thumbnails for each file will appear in one half of the application. Double-click on the thumbnails for a preview.</p>
<p>These thumbnails prove that all your captured video clips are already in the application and ready to be edited. Click on the Filmora video editing guide to get to help you know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add clips to the timeline, trim, adjust appropriately and sequence them.</strong></p>

                      alt="filmora split video"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you have reviewed your video library and seen that they are there, you need to add them to the video editing timeline at the bottom of your app. This is quite easy as you can view all your video clips and determine which is to be added first.</p>
<p>Drag and drop each video or photo in the timeline to add it to your project.</p>
<p>After adding the clips, you can trim and adjust them appropriately. Click on the right or left edges of the clip you want to shorten in the timeline and drag it to shorten.</p>

<p>When working on your video footage, click the spacebar of your computer keyboard to preview. By doing this, you will be able to see how your clips are joined together.</p>
<p>Trim appropriately and perfect the runtime of every single clip and re-order your clips where there is a need to do so. This can be done by clicking on the targeted clip and dragging it to where you want it to be.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add video Effects, Transmissions between the clips, and Text overlays</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Click on the Effect icon at the top of the app and a deep visual library of effects will be visible. If you want to add a certain effect to your active clip, just double-click it.</p>
<p>Add transitions in your video timeline to cut the scene-to-scene. They are quite necessary as they help establish your audience’s attention.</p>
<p>The next thing after adding the transmissions will be adding the overlays and exporting your video by clicking on the ‘<em>Export</em>‘ button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Export your finished video.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/export-to-local-win-1.png"

Two basic techniques can be implemented to play videos with QuickTime. The first method to play videos with QuickTime are featured as follows:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open QuickTime Player across your Mac. For that, proceed across Launchpad to access the application.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-1.jpg"
                      alt="select quicktime player"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Once the player is launched, you can simply select any video across the window that opens up. Once selected, tap “Open” to play it across QuickTime.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-2.jpg"
                      alt="tap on open button"
                ></p>
<p>Sounds easy, right? However, if you have multiple videos to open or have other video players installed in your Mac, you should consider following this second approach. If QuickTime Player is not your default video player, it is important to follow the steps below for opening any video across QuickTime.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open Finder on your device and proceed to locate the video that you wish to open across QuickTime. On finding the video, click on the video while holding the “Control” button on the keyboard. This opens a drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-3.jpg"

Although there are several QuickTime format files that you may come across and play across the platform, it only converts any video file into MOV format, which is the dedicated file format potentially designed by Apple. To understand the method to convert any QuickTime video format to MOV format, follow the steps shown below:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open the appropriate video across QuickTime to convert it accordingly. Once opened, tap on the “File” tab, and select “Export as” across the available options.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="access export as option"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: You need to select an appropriate resolution from the available options according to the video quality that you want the video to be saved in on the preceding menu. QuickTime player will show low-quality resolutions for the high-quality video but not vice versa.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 3: A new window opens that requires you to set up the name and location for the video. Add the file extension “.mov” at the end of the name of the video to convert it into MOV format.</p>

Although there are several QuickTime format files that you may come across and play across the platform, it only converts any video file into MOV format, which is the dedicated file format potentially designed by Apple. To understand the method to convert any QuickTime video format to MOV format, follow the steps shown below:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open the appropriate video across QuickTime to convert it accordingly. Once opened, tap on the “File” tab, and select “Export as” across the available options.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="access export as option"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: You need to select an appropriate resolution from the available options according to the video quality that you want the video to be saved in on the preceding menu. QuickTime player will show low-quality resolutions for the high-quality video but not vice versa.</p>

                      alt="choose video quality"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: A new window opens that requires you to set up the name and location for the video. Add the file extension “.mov” at the end of the name of the video to convert it into MOV format.</p>

These features will give a better understanding of the tool and provide a guideline on how to utilize the best functions with ease:</p>
<h3 id="1-Interface"><a href="#1-Interface" class="headerlink" title="1. Interface"></a>1. Interface</h3><p>When understanding the interface of <strong>the LumaFusion app</strong> on iOS, many would think the application won’t provide extensive tools to work with. This video editor does not come with a bland user interface but provides some great functions and features on an interface that allows you to create professional-level videos.</p>
<p>With the option of adding titles, transitions, color grading, and effects, LumaFusion is a complete video editor that provides features that are not commonly observed in many desktop-based video editors. Regardless, it presents an efficient workspace that has managed all the functions properly in rows and different sections.</p>

<h3 id="2-Video’s-Layers"><a href="#2-Video’s-Layers" class="headerlink" title="2. Video’s Layers"></a>2. Video’s Layers</h3><p>Creating proper movies on your iOS device is not difficult with LumaFusion. With the option of including six layers of video in the timeline, a lot can be done with them for improvising different sequences and multiple effects. Its picture-in-picture presets, layered transitions, graphic equalizer, and the use of additional plugins allow you to create complete videos with proper control.</p>
<p>Talking about some renowned iOS video editors in the market, you will find <strong>LumaFusion</strong> a much better option. iMovie, the dedicated video editor for iOS devices, can only embed two layers of videos in the timeline. This clearly explains why LumaFusion is a much better option with its video layers.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="3-Powerful-Keyframe"><a href="#3-Powerful-Keyframe" class="headerlink" title="3. Powerful Keyframe"></a>3. Powerful Keyframe</h3><p>The keyframes function on LumaFusion is not challenging to work with on the video editor. You can ecstatically create animating effects with the help of the keyframe sounds within the application. These effects, once created, can be saved and used on other videos within the platform. To improve your effects on the mobile video editor, you can use the powerful keyframe feature of LumaFusion to create the best results.</p>
<p>With a small price to pay for the video editor, you can gain access to a diversity of keyframes that can help you design the perfect effects for your video.</p>

<h3 id="4-Export-to-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#4-Export-to-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="4. Export to Final Cut Pro"></a>4. Export to Final Cut Pro</h3><p>Another impressive and touching feature this video editor provides to its users is its integration with Final Cut Pro - a proficient desktop video editor offered on macOS. You can easily export your created video to Final Cut Pro as an FCPXML.zip file directly after paying a one-time price. Users who are having a rough time editing the file on LumaFusion can easily shift to Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>This process has disadvantages, regardless of the extensive control and accessibility provided between the applications. If you seek to use Final Cut Pro after editing a video on the <strong>LumaFusion app</strong>, you will have to add all the assets on FCP when you shift the file onto the platform.</p>
<p>Also, you might have to include many effects such as LUTs, Chroma key, and other relevant features. With this effort, you can easily put your video from LumaFusion to Final Cut Pro.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Key-Features-of-LumaFusion-Video-Editor-1"><a href="#Part-2-Key-Features-of-LumaFusion-Video-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Key Features of LumaFusion Video Editor"></a>Part 2: Key Features of LumaFusion Video Editor</h2><p>We will now highlight some essential features that can be considered about the <strong>LumaFusion video editor</strong>. These features will give a better understanding of the tool and provide a guideline on how to utilize the best functions with ease:</p>
<h3 id="1-Interface-1"><a href="#1-Interface-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Interface"></a>1. Interface</h3><p>When understanding the interface of <strong>the LumaFusion app</strong> on iOS, many would think the application won’t provide extensive tools to work with. This video editor does not come with a bland user interface but provides some great functions and features on an interface that allows you to create professional-level videos.</p>
<p>With the option of adding titles, transitions, color grading, and effects, LumaFusion is a complete video editor that provides features that are not commonly observed in many desktop-based video editors. Regardless, it presents an efficient workspace that has managed all the functions properly in rows and different sections.</p>

<h3 id="2-Video’s-Layers-1"><a href="#2-Video’s-Layers-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Video’s Layers"></a>2. Video’s Layers</h3><p>Creating proper movies on your iOS device is not difficult with LumaFusion. With the option of including six layers of video in the timeline, a lot can be done with them for improvising different sequences and multiple effects. Its picture-in-picture presets, layered transitions, graphic equalizer, and the use of additional plugins allow you to create complete videos with proper control.</p>
<p>Talking about some renowned iOS video editors in the market, you will find <strong>LumaFusion</strong> a much better option. iMovie, the dedicated video editor for iOS devices, can only embed two layers of videos in the timeline. This clearly explains why LumaFusion is a much better option with its video layers.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="3-Powerful-Keyframe-1"><a href="#3-Powerful-Keyframe-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Powerful Keyframe"></a>3. Powerful Keyframe</h3><p>The keyframes function on LumaFusion is not challenging to work with on the video editor. You can ecstatically create animating effects with the help of the keyframe sounds within the application. These effects, once created, can be saved and used on other videos within the platform. To improve your effects on the mobile video editor, you can use the powerful keyframe feature of LumaFusion to create the best results.</p>
<p>With a small price to pay for the video editor, you can gain access to a diversity of keyframes that can help you design the perfect effects for your video.</p>

<h3 id="4-Export-to-Final-Cut-Pro-1"><a href="#4-Export-to-Final-Cut-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Export to Final Cut Pro"></a>4. Export to Final Cut Pro</h3><p>Another impressive and touching feature this video editor provides to its users is its integration with Final Cut Pro - a proficient desktop video editor offered on macOS. You can easily export your created video to Final Cut Pro as an FCPXML.zip file directly after paying a one-time price. Users who are having a rough time editing the file on LumaFusion can easily shift to Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>This process has disadvantages, regardless of the extensive control and accessibility provided between the applications. If you seek to use Final Cut Pro after editing a video on the <strong>LumaFusion app</strong>, you will have to add all the assets on FCP when you shift the file onto the platform.</p>
<p>Also, you might have to include many effects such as LUTs, Chroma key, and other relevant features. With this effort, you can easily put your video from LumaFusion to Final Cut Pro.</p>

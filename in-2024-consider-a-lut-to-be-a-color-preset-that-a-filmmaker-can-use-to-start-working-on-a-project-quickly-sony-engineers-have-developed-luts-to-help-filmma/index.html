Sony Engineers Have Developed LUTs to Help Filmmakers Perform Specific Tasks. All of These Are Available for Free</h2><p>If you’ve ever worked in the color grading profession, you’re aware of how time-consuming and labor-intensive it is to achieve a specific look on a scene. To master color grading, you must practice constantly, one of the reasons for the existence of specialists in this field. While everybody can color grade, not everyone can do it well. People in this business have devised remedies to make the editing workflow considerably more accessible and less time-consuming.</p>
<p>Achieving a specific ambiance in a scene demands ongoing effort and naturally takes longer. LUTs, or Lookup Tables, were created as a result. LUTs are ideal for storing a set of colors to use later or in another program. A LUT is the most effective technique to color or alters your image’s colors.</p>
<h2 id="Benefits-of-using-LUTs"><a href="#Benefits-of-using-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of using LUTs"></a>Benefits of using LUTs</h2><p>There are numerous advantages to using lookup tables to edit your footage. We’ve already discussed that it helps to give your films a more polished and professional appearance, which is one of the primary explanations why individuals use LUTs, but there are many more.</p>
<h3 id="1-A-beginning-towards-professionalism"><a href="#1-A-beginning-towards-professionalism" class="headerlink" title="1. A beginning towards professionalism"></a>1. A beginning towards professionalism</h3><p>This is a fantastic approach for beginners to have a good idea of how to build their own trademark looks in their videos. The time it takes to develop your color grading craft is unavoidable. So, as a novice, LUTs will come in useful for you to establish your approach and save your ass, big time.</p>
<p>You’ll eventually come up with a blend of your own LUTs to use, resulting in your own LUT. Not only will LUTs aid in color grading learning, but they will also save funds and resources. You will not only devote time to learning color grading, but you will also spend a significant amount of money on color grading tools and equipment, such as software and color panels. You’ll see why color grading equipment is necessary when you get to this point.</p>
<p>However, for the time being, employing LUTs is the most cost-effective way to obtain a cinematic look.</p>
<h3 id="2-It-saves-your-time"><a href="#2-It-saves-your-time" class="headerlink" title="2. It saves your time"></a>2. It saves your time</h3><p>Because LUTs are predefined colors used to establish a specific look on a picture, they save you time. Having a trustworthy LUT to use for video will save the life of freelance editors who are constantly meeting commitments and modifications. Isn’t the purpose of color grading to generate a visual emotion for your movie? So, with LUTs, you can create one without going through the time-consuming process of manual color correction. Only one-color preset will be applied to all scenes in a single LUT.</p>
<p>However, there’s a good probability that it won’t look the same in all of the images. This is where you’ll adjust the colors to make them more evenly match the film. It’s nothing significant most of the time, just some little saturation adjustments, etc.</p>
<h3 id="3-Work-on-a-budget"><a href="#3-Work-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="3. Work on a budget"></a>3. Work on a budget</h3><p>Time spent in a color-grade suite may be highly costly, and it can lead your films to go over budget in order to achieve a specific aesthetic. LUTs, on the other hand, are available for free online or for a fee for more complex versions. Even if you buy your LUTs, you could save thousands of dollars based on the size of your film. LUTs can also assist you in meeting tight deadlines, and setting targets too optimistically is something I’m sure we’ve all done at some point.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a client or a personal project, things can often get pushed to the last minute, so having something in your arsenal that can save you time is always a good bonus. There are, however, projects where you need to appear competent without investing a lot of time on them due to budget limits; this is where a lookup table comes in handy because you can modify the complete style of your movie in a matter of seconds by pressing a few buttons. Even complicated editing can be completed quickly, giving you more time to work on other tasks that will earn you more money.</p>
<h3 id="4-It-provides-an-artistic-approach"><a href="#4-It-provides-an-artistic-approach" class="headerlink" title="4. It provides an artistic approach"></a>4. It provides an artistic approach</h3><p>LUTs are beneficial because they allow videos shot with cameras that shoot very dark, discolored images to have more vivid tones and contrast. This is excellent for grabbing viewers’ attention and making videos more intriguing and engaging. LUTs add an artistic element to videos and can help you develop a visual artistic identity for your videos if you use the same colors. Another advantage of LUTs is that they enhance the color quality of videos shot on smartphones with particular color schemes. Although this varies significantly from brand to brand, you can use LUTs to make a Smartphone video more vibrant and appealing.</p>

Do You Know the Differences Between Them? This Article Will Introduce the Concepts, Features and Differnces of Them"></a>Have You Ever Heard Hyperlapse and Tume Lapse Videos? Do You Know the Differences Between Them? This Article Will Introduce the Concepts, Features and Differnces of Them</h2><p>You’ve probably heard the terms “hyperlapse” and “timelapse” before. Whether it was in a blog post, a how-to guide, or on your preferred social media platform. Each of us has seen at least one image of one of them. However, what makes a difference? You’re about to learn in this article!</p>
<p>With that said, let’s begin!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-timelapse-and-how-is-it-used"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-timelapse-and-how-is-it-used" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is a timelapse, and how is it used?"></a>Part 1. What is a timelapse, and how is it used?</h2><p>Timelapses are familiar to you, whether they were used in a series to demonstrate a swift change from night today or at the beginning of your favorite influencer’s vlog. But exactly what is it? The term “timelapse” refers to a photography method in which static images are stitched together to produce a time-warping video. When the video is played, the time seems to pass more quickly, creating the illusion that time is slipping away.</p>
<p>Put your camera in a fixed position, stop it from moving, panning, or tilting, then record for a long time to make your own timelapse. This period of time could last for five minutes, an hour, days, or even years. Once the film is gathered, all that’s left to do is speed everything up.</p>
<p>The fact that time-lapses make for a pleasant visual effect is what makes them so popular in Vlogs and other media. This method enables you to describe the passage of time, the movement of individuals through space, etc. utilizes time-lapse.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-a-hyperlapse"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-a-hyperlapse" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What is a hyperlapse?"></a>Part 2. What is a hyperlapse?</h2><p>On the other side, there are these things that we refer to as hyperlapses. In the subgenre of time-lapse photography known as cinematography, a hyperlapse is a filmmaking method used to generate motion shots by capturing movies rather than taking images. In order to create a hyperlapse, the camera does not remain stationary; rather, it follows the subject around and is typically held by the photographer.</p>
<p>The amount of time that elapses between pictures in a stop-motion video typically ranges from tenths of a second up to a few fractions of a second, although this can change significantly depending on what you want to show. However, after you have picked it, it must remain consistent in the same way that the timelapse does.</p>
<p>The attractive 3D look that hyperlapse produces is the primary draw for its utilization. The hyperlapse that is formed can produce a dreamy image, regardless of whether the camera is attached to a moving vehicle or is mounted on a tripod that is moving towards its target.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may use this approach to make stunning photographs with motion blur by employing long exposures. In most cases, the final image will be stabilized in post-production in order to eliminate some of the flaws that may have been captured in the original photo.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-What-differentiates-them-from-each-other"><a href="#Part-3-What-differentiates-them-from-each-other" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What differentiates them from each other?"></a>Part 3. What differentiates them from each other?</h2><p>The movement of the camera is what differentiates these two approaches the most from one another. When capturing a time lapse, the camera is kept relatively still and in the same position throughout. In addition, when you use a hyperlapse, the camera is continuously moving, which creates a 3D appearance in the image.</p>
<p>You could be scratching your head right about now, wondering when you should employ one of the two methods. If your subject is moving, you should take a time-lapse photograph; if the camera is moving, you should take a hyperlapse photograph. This question has a relatively straightforward answer.</p>
<p>The act of recording video for a hyperlapse can cause your storage to be filled up really rapidly. Therefore, you may wish to swap between the two methods depending on the length of time that you want to shoot for. If you are going to be filming for a significant amount of time, you should consider using a timelapse.</p>
<p>It is simple to determine the timelapse interval if you already know these answers. Choose the video’s final frame rate. It may be 24, 25, or 30 fps. You shouldn’t select more quickly. Choose the option that best fits your audience and location. Additionally, a time-lapse calculator is available.</p>
<p>The shoot time should then be converted to seconds. For instance, two hours are equal to 2 x 60 x 60 seconds, or 7200 seconds. Determine how many frames are required for your chosen timelapse now. For instance, the final product should be 30 seconds of 25fps video. You’ll need to capture 750 frames in total because 30 x 25 is 750.</p>
<p>Divide the time (7200s in this case) by the number of frames to obtain the interval (750). You can round up the result, which is 9.6, which is pretty near to 10 seconds. Therefore, in our case, your interval should be set to 10s.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Motion-control-timelapse"><a href="#Part-4-Motion-control-timelapse" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Motion control timelapse"></a>Part 4. Motion control timelapse</h2><p>Now that we understand how the timelapse images that are static are created, we are able to incorporate some movement into the shots that are static. Moving the camera around during a timelapse is much more difficult than it appears to be in the video. Every movement of the camera is slowed down when using slow motion, which means that you can make even a shaky handheld movie look good when using slow motion. The situation is completely reversed while viewing a timelapse.</p>
<p>Because every movement of the camera is sped up, shooting with the handheld mode is nearly impossible. If you want the camera to appear to be moving slowly in the final timelapse, you will need to move it very slowly while shooting in order to achieve this effect.</p>
<p>For this reason, we will need to make use of motion control devices in order to accomplish our goal. Therefore, we refer to these kinds of photos as motion control timelapses. The camera can be moved very slowly and accurately along one, two, or all three axes using motors that are controlled electronically. The three-axis systems, which include a slider as well as a pan-tilt head, are by far the most popular.</p>

<p>Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.</p>
<p>They aren’t exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we’ve put together this guide to take you through the steps. We’ll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you’ve shot it.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video"><a href="#What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Time Lapse Video?"></a>What Is A Time Lapse Video?</h2><p>In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.</p>
<p>When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.</p>
<p>Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?"></a>How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?</h2><h3 id="Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video"></a>Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video</h3><p>Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what’s more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.</p>
<p>When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn’t move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.</p>
<p>Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:</p>
<h4 id="1-Sunset-Sunrise"><a href="#1-Sunset-Sunrise" class="headerlink" title="1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise"></a>1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise</h4><p>These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.</p>
<h4 id="2-Clouds"><a href="#2-Clouds" class="headerlink" title="2. Clouds"></a>2. Clouds</h4><p>Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!</p>
<h4 id="3-Starry-sky"><a href="#3-Starry-sky" class="headerlink" title="3. Starry sky"></a>3. Starry sky</h4><p>Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.</p>
<h4 id="4-Flowers"><a href="#4-Flowers" class="headerlink" title="4. Flowers"></a>4. Flowers</h4><p>Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!</p>
<h4 id="5-Season-changing"><a href="#5-Season-changing" class="headerlink" title="5. Season changing"></a>5. Season changing</h4><p>The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don’t have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.</p>

Find a place to set up your camera on tripod</h4><p>While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.</p>
<p><em>Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don’t want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots.</em></p>
<h4 id="3-Set-the-camera-focus"><a href="#3-Set-the-camera-focus" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the camera focus"></a>3. Set the camera focus</h4><p>Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.</p>

That’s where Wondershare Filmora comes into play.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.</p>
<p>If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.</p>
<p>Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.</p>
<h3 id="Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Speed up your time-lapse video"></a>Speed up your time-lapse video</h3><p>Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.</p>
<p>When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.</p>
<p>Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.</li>
<li>Launch Filmora and click the <strong>New project</strong> button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Click the <strong>Speed</strong> icon and select the <strong>Fast</strong> option. Select 2x, 4x, 8x, etc, depending on how much you want to speed up.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Slow down your time-lapse video"></a>Slow down your time-lapse video</h3><p>As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.</p>
<p>You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the <strong>Fast</strong> option choose <strong>Slow</strong> when you’re at step 4.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It’s easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.</p>
<p>Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don’t be afraid to create something unique and experimental.</p>

<p>Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.</p>
<p>They aren’t exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we’ve put together this guide to take you through the steps. We’ll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you’ve shot it.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-1"><a href="#What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Time Lapse Video?"></a>What Is A Time Lapse Video?</h2><p>In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.</p>
<p>When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.</p>
<p>Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-1"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?"></a>How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?</h2><h3 id="Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-1"><a href="#Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video"></a>Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video</h3><p>Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what’s more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.</p>
<p>When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn’t move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.</p>
<p>Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:</p>
<h4 id="1-Sunset-Sunrise-1"><a href="#1-Sunset-Sunrise-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise"></a>1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise</h4><p>These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.</p>
<h4 id="2-Clouds-1"><a href="#2-Clouds-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Clouds"></a>2. Clouds</h4><p>Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!</p>
<h4 id="3-Starry-sky-1"><a href="#3-Starry-sky-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Starry sky"></a>3. Starry sky</h4><p>Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.</p>
<h4 id="4-Flowers-1"><a href="#4-Flowers-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Flowers"></a>4. Flowers</h4><p>Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!</p>
<h4 id="5-Season-changing-1"><a href="#5-Season-changing-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Season changing"></a>5. Season changing</h4><p>The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don’t have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.</p>
<h4 id="6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-1"><a href="#6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Cars or Pedestrians"></a>6. Cars or Pedestrians</h4><p>If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.</p>
<h4 id="7-Cooking-dinner-1"><a href="#7-Cooking-dinner-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Cooking dinner"></a>7. Cooking dinner</h4><p>Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It’s easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!</p>
<h4 id="8-DIY-projects-1"><a href="#8-DIY-projects-1" class="headerlink" title="8. DIY projects"></a>8. DIY projects</h4><p>Are you building something? Whether it’s a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.</p>

But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.</p>
<p>If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.</p>
<h4 id="1-Decide-on-a-subject-1"><a href="#1-Decide-on-a-subject-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Decide on a subject"></a>1.

<h4 id="2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-1"><a href="#2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod"></a>2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod</h4><p>While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.</p>
<p><em>Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don’t want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots.</em></p>
<h4 id="3-Set-the-camera-focus-1"><a href="#3-Set-the-camera-focus-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the camera focus"></a>3. Set the camera focus</h4><p>Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Set-your-exposure-settings-1"><a href="#4-Set-your-exposure-settings-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Set your exposure settings"></a>4.

That’s where Wondershare Filmora comes into play.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.</p>
<p>If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.</p>
<p>Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.</p>
<h3 id="Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-1"><a href="#Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Speed up your time-lapse video"></a>Speed up your time-lapse video</h3><p>Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.</p>
<p>When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.</p>
<p>Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.</li>
<li>Launch Filmora and click the <strong>New project</strong> button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>

<h3 id="Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-1"><a href="#Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Slow down your time-lapse video"></a>Slow down your time-lapse video</h3><p>As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.</p>
<p>You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the <strong>Fast</strong> option choose <strong>Slow</strong> when you’re at step 4.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It’s easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.</p>
<p>Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don’t be afraid to create something unique and experimental.</p>

<p>Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.</p>
<p>They aren’t exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we’ve put together this guide to take you through the steps. We’ll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you’ve shot it.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-2"><a href="#What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Time Lapse Video?"></a>What Is A Time Lapse Video?</h2><p>In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.</p>
<p>When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.</p>
<p>Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-2"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?"></a>How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?</h2><h3 id="Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-2"><a href="#Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-2" class="headerlink" title="Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video"></a>Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video</h3><p>Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what’s more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.</p>
<p>When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn’t move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.</p>
<p>Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:</p>
<h4 id="1-Sunset-Sunrise-2"><a href="#1-Sunset-Sunrise-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise"></a>1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise</h4><p>These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.</p>
<h4 id="2-Clouds-2"><a href="#2-Clouds-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Clouds"></a>2. Clouds</h4><p>Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!</p>
<h4 id="3-Starry-sky-2"><a href="#3-Starry-sky-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Starry sky"></a>3. Starry sky</h4><p>Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.</p>
<h4 id="4-Flowers-2"><a href="#4-Flowers-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Flowers"></a>4. Flowers</h4><p>Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!</p>
<h4 id="5-Season-changing-2"><a href="#5-Season-changing-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Season changing"></a>5. Season changing</h4><p>The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don’t have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.</p>
<h4 id="6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-2"><a href="#6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Cars or Pedestrians"></a>6. Cars or Pedestrians</h4><p>If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.</p>
<h4 id="7-Cooking-dinner-2"><a href="#7-Cooking-dinner-2" class="headerlink" title="7. Cooking dinner"></a>7. Cooking dinner</h4><p>Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It’s easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!</p>
<h4 id="8-DIY-projects-2"><a href="#8-DIY-projects-2" class="headerlink" title="8. DIY projects"></a>8. DIY projects</h4><p>Are you building something? Whether it’s a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.</p>
<h4 id="9-Construction-work-in-progress-2"><a href="#9-Construction-work-in-progress-2" class="headerlink" title="9. Construction work in progress"></a>9. Construction work in progress</h4><p>If you’re watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video.

Find a place to set up your camera on tripod</h4><p>While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.</p>
<p><em>Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don’t want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots.</em></p>

That’s where Wondershare Filmora comes into play.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.</p>
<p>If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.</p>
<p>Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.</p>
<h3 id="Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-2"><a href="#Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-2" class="headerlink" title="Speed up your time-lapse video"></a>Speed up your time-lapse video</h3><p>Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.</p>
<p>When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.</p>
<p>Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.</li>
<li>Launch Filmora and click the <strong>New project</strong> button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>

</ul>
<h3 id="Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-2"><a href="#Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-2" class="headerlink" title="Slow down your time-lapse video"></a>Slow down your time-lapse video</h3><p>As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.</p>
<p>You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the <strong>Fast</strong> option choose <strong>Slow</strong> when you’re at step 4.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It’s easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.</p>
<p>Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don’t be afraid to create something unique and experimental.</p>

<p>Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.</p>
<p>They aren’t exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we’ve put together this guide to take you through the steps. We’ll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you’ve shot it.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-3"><a href="#What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Time Lapse Video?"></a>What Is A Time Lapse Video?</h2><p>In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.</p>
<p>When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.</p>
<p>Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-3"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?"></a>How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?</h2><h3 id="Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-3"><a href="#Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video"></a>Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video</h3><p>Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what’s more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.</p>
<p>When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn’t move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.</p>
<p>Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:</p>
<h4 id="1-Sunset-Sunrise-3"><a href="#1-Sunset-Sunrise-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise"></a>1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise</h4><p>These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.</p>
<h4 id="2-Clouds-3"><a href="#2-Clouds-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Clouds"></a>2. Clouds</h4><p>Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!</p>
<h4 id="3-Starry-sky-3"><a href="#3-Starry-sky-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Starry sky"></a>3. Starry sky</h4><p>Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.</p>
<h4 id="4-Flowers-3"><a href="#4-Flowers-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Flowers"></a>4. Flowers</h4><p>Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!</p>
<h4 id="5-Season-changing-3"><a href="#5-Season-changing-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Season changing"></a>5. Season changing</h4><p>The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don’t have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.</p>
<h4 id="6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-3"><a href="#6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Cars or Pedestrians"></a>6. Cars or Pedestrians</h4><p>If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.</p>
<h4 id="7-Cooking-dinner-3"><a href="#7-Cooking-dinner-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Cooking dinner"></a>7. Cooking dinner</h4><p>Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It’s easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!</p>
<h4 id="8-DIY-projects-3"><a href="#8-DIY-projects-3" class="headerlink" title="8. DIY projects"></a>8. DIY projects</h4><p>Are you building something? Whether it’s a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.</p>
<h4 id="9-Construction-work-in-progress-3"><a href="#9-Construction-work-in-progress-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Construction work in progress"></a>9. Construction work in progress</h4><p>If you’re watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It’s hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it’s finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.</p>
<h4 id="10-A-fun-art-project-3"><a href="#10-A-fun-art-project-3" class="headerlink" title="10. A fun art project"></a>10. A fun art project</h4><p>Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.</p>

Find a place to set up your camera on tripod</h4><p>While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.</p>
<p><em>Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don’t want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots.</em></p>
<h4 id="3-Set-the-camera-focus-3"><a href="#3-Set-the-camera-focus-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the camera focus"></a>3. Set the camera focus</h4><p>Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.</p>

That’s where Wondershare Filmora comes into play.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.</p>
<p>If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.</p>
<p>Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.</p>
<h3 id="Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-3"><a href="#Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Speed up your time-lapse video"></a>Speed up your time-lapse video</h3><p>Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.</p>
<p>When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.</p>
<p>Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.</li>
<li>Launch Filmora and click the <strong>New project</strong> button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="drag the media file to the timeline"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Click the <strong>Speed</strong> icon and select the <strong>Fast</strong> option. Select 2x, 4x, 8x, etc, depending on how much you want to speed up.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-3"><a href="#Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Slow down your time-lapse video"></a>Slow down your time-lapse video</h3><p>As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.</p>
<p>You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the <strong>Fast</strong> option choose <strong>Slow</strong> when you’re at step 4.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It’s easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.</p>
<p>Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don’t be afraid to create something unique and experimental.</p>

Unfortunately, some social media platforms like Instagram require your video to be short. Therefore, many people wonder how to cut a video to make it easier to share. If you’re wondering how to cut video for Instagram on Mac, you’re in luck. This article shares the best tools to use for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>What You Should Know About Instagram Video</strong></p>

<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid Instagram Video Cutter?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>

<li><strong>How do you post long videos on Instagram without splitting?</strong> Instagram allows users to post long videos on the app, as long as 60 seconds. Alternatively, you can use the IGTV to upload long clips on Instagram without splitting.</li>
<li><strong>What is multi-capture on Instagram:</strong> This tool allows you to create and share multiple photos on your stories.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video. When deciding which is the best option for you, free or paid, the factors listed will help you decide. Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter.

Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid Instagram Video Cutter?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How do you post long videos on Instagram without splitting?</strong> Instagram allows users to post long videos on the app, as long as 60 seconds. Alternatively, you can use the IGTV to upload long clips on Instagram without splitting.</li>
<li><strong>What is multi-capture on Instagram:</strong> This tool allows you to create and share multiple photos on your stories.</li>
<li><strong>How do I split the video into two parts for Instagram on Mac?</strong> The paid and free video cutters shared above will help you split a video into two parts for Instagram on Mac. Simply pick the option that fits your preference.</li>
<li><strong>Why can’t I split a video on iMovie?</strong> Maybe your iMovie software is experiencing a glitch; you can simply restart the software. Alternately, move the clip to the center row if you find the option greyed out. Moving the clip should help fix the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video. When deciding which is the best option for you, free or paid, the factors listed will help you decide. Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

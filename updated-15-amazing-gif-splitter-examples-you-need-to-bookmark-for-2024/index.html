These are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When you are splitting a GIF into frames, it is important to keep the size of each frame as close as possible to the original size of the GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The first frame should be the same size or slightly bigger than the original frame, and subsequent frames should be smaller than this.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can use tools to crop and resize your frames for your GIFs if needed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you want to keep your GIF on its original aspect ratio, you need to make sure that all of your frames are in the same aspect ratio as well.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make sure you are splitting the subject in a way that makes sense for the GIF and for the viewer.</p>

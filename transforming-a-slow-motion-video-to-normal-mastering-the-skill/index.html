And as far as the question of what scene can be used for it, you can use any and every photo you want to match the colour for. And the following steps will be noting how you can adjust the color of an image in Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> Open both the images, the one you want to alter and the one you want to change it with. And if it is just one image, open and select that one image.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> Choose the “Image” and then select the “Adjustment” option. And after you choose the “Adjustment” option, go to the “Match Colour” option. You will be noticing the target photo that you have opted for.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> You will find the “Image Statistics” portion in the dialogue portion. Opt for the “Source” list and select the image name consisting of the shades and hues you would want your image to be altered. You will notice a thumbnail appearing in the dialogue as you do so. And you will automatically see the colours of the photo have changed.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> Now use the “Preview” feature to see the <strong>photoshop match colour tone</strong>, and then you will be done with adjusting the colour!</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-perfectly-match-colors-in-Photoshop-when-combining-photos"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-perfectly-match-colors-in-Photoshop-when-combining-photos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to perfectly match colors in Photoshop when combining photos"></a>Part 2 How to perfectly match colors in Photoshop when combining photos</h2><p>Now, we will be discussing the different steps that will help you <strong>match color from photo</strong> in Photoshop, with absolute precision and effortlessness. Here is the list of steps that you would need to follow to <strong>match skin tone in Photoshop</strong> most perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 Duplicate the background of the original photo</strong></p>
<p>The first and the most essential step to <strong>match lighting photoshop</strong> or the colour or any other editing task is to duplicate the background of the original image. The reason for this is that without this step, we might lose out on the original background information, which is essential for the image.</p>
<p>And to duplicate the background of an image in Photoshop, you need to use a few shortcuts of your keyboard. If you are using a Windows device, then the shortcut for this will be “Ctrl+J”, and if you are using Mac, then the shortcut will be “ Command+J”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-1.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop duplicate layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Select the Image whose colour you want to change.</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop has several selection tools. Choose one of the many selection tools. You might choose the “Pen Tool” or the “Lasso Tool” or anything else. Select the image with the tool by drawing along the image with the tool. And when you are done with tracing the image with the selection tool of your choice, you will see a border marching around the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="selection tool"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 Select the area of the second image</strong></p>
<p>You will need the selection tool again. The second image is the one that consists of the colour you would want the original image to match with. So, use the selection tool again to trace out an area in the second picture with the colour you want.</p>
<p>Ensure that you trace out a substantial area with the colour you need. You need not be highly precise with selecting the area. Instead, focus on covering a large area so that you can cover up the different shades and hues of the colour.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-3.jpg"
                      alt="select purple"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 Move back to the original picture</strong></p>
<p>We will proceed with the “Colour Match” feature in Photoshop, but before that, you must make sure that you have the original image selected. The technical term to use here is “Focus”. So, ensure that the original image is in focus.</p>
<p>You can bring the original image into “focus” by clicking anywhere inside the document’s window where the original image is present. And that will automatically bring back the focus to the original image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 Bring the “Colour Match” command into function</strong></p>
<p>After selecting the original image, reach out to the “Image” option and click on the “Adjustments” option. You will find the “Match Colour” option; click on it.</p>
<p>There are two sections of the “Color Match” option. One is the “Image Statistics” portion, and the other is the “Destination Image”. The “destination Image” portion consists of the name of the original image and a few image settings as well. The options include “luminescence”, “color intensity”, “fade”, and “neutralize”.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6 Head to the “Image Statistics” portion</strong></p>
<p>The “Image Statistics” portion consists of the “Source” option. It is present in the bottom down part of the “Image Statistics” box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the “Source” option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.</p>

Here is the list of steps that you would need to follow to <strong>match skin tone in Photoshop</strong> most perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 Duplicate the background of the original photo</strong></p>
<p>The first and the most essential step to <strong>match lighting photoshop</strong> or the colour or any other editing task is to duplicate the background of the original image. The reason for this is that without this step, we might lose out on the original background information, which is essential for the image.</p>
<p>And to duplicate the background of an image in Photoshop, you need to use a few shortcuts of your keyboard. If you are using a Windows device, then the shortcut for this will be “Ctrl+J”, and if you are using Mac, then the shortcut will be “ Command+J”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop duplicate layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Select the Image whose colour you want to change.</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop has several selection tools. Choose one of the many selection tools. You might choose the “Pen Tool” or the “Lasso Tool” or anything else. Select the image with the tool by drawing along the image with the tool. And when you are done with tracing the image with the selection tool of your choice, you will see a border marching around the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="selection tool"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 Select the area of the second image</strong></p>
<p>You will need the selection tool again. The second image is the one that consists of the colour you would want the original image to match with. So, use the selection tool again to trace out an area in the second picture with the colour you want.</p>
<p>Ensure that you trace out a substantial area with the colour you need. You need not be highly precise with selecting the area. Instead, focus on covering a large area so that you can cover up the different shades and hues of the colour.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select purple"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 Move back to the original picture</strong></p>
<p>We will proceed with the “Colour Match” feature in Photoshop, but before that, you must make sure that you have the original image selected. The technical term to use here is “Focus”. So, ensure that the original image is in focus.</p>
<p>You can bring the original image into “focus” by clicking anywhere inside the document’s window where the original image is present. And that will automatically bring back the focus to the original image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 Bring the “Colour Match” command into function</strong></p>
<p>After selecting the original image, reach out to the “Image” option and click on the “Adjustments” option. You will find the “Match Colour” option; click on it.</p>
<p>There are two sections of the “Color Match” option. One is the “Image Statistics” portion, and the other is the “Destination Image”. The “destination Image” portion consists of the name of the original image and a few image settings as well. The options include “luminescence”, “color intensity”, “fade”, and “neutralize”.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6 Head to the “Image Statistics” portion</strong></p>
<p>The “Image Statistics” portion consists of the “Source” option. It is present in the bottom down part of the “Image Statistics” box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the “Source” option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.</p>

<p>Click on “OK” after doing the changes mentioned above and exit the dialogue box to proceed with the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8 Add “Adjustment Layer”</strong></p>
<p>Go to the “Layers” option and then opt for the “Layers Palette” present at the bottom. Then select “New Adjustment Layer” and click on the “Levels” option.</p>

                ></p>

<p>After selecting the original image, reach out to the “Image” option and click on the “Adjustments” option. You will find the “Match Colour” option; click on it.</p>
<p>There are two sections of the “Color Match” option. One is the “Image Statistics” portion, and the other is the “Destination Image”.

<p><strong>Step 6 Head to the “Image Statistics” portion</strong></p>
<p>The “Image Statistics” portion consists of the “Source” option. It is present in the bottom down part of the “Image Statistics” box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the “Source” option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.</p>

And as far as the question of what scene can be used for it, you can use any and every photo you want to match the colour for. And the following steps will be noting how you can adjust the color of an image in Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> Open both the images, the one you want to alter and the one you want to change it with. And if it is just one image, open and select that one image.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> Choose the “Image” and then select the “Adjustment” option. And after you choose the “Adjustment” option, go to the “Match Colour” option. You will be noticing the target photo that you have opted for.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> You will find the “Image Statistics” portion in the dialogue portion.

Here is the list of steps that you would need to follow to <strong>match skin tone in Photoshop</strong> most perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 Duplicate the background of the original photo</strong></p>
<p>The first and the most essential step to <strong>match lighting photoshop</strong> or the colour or any other editing task is to duplicate the background of the original image. The reason for this is that without this step, we might lose out on the original background information, which is essential for the image.</p>
<p>And to duplicate the background of an image in Photoshop, you need to use a few shortcuts of your keyboard. If you are using a Windows device, then the shortcut for this will be “Ctrl+J”, and if you are using Mac, then the shortcut will be “ Command+J”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop duplicate layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Select the Image whose colour you want to change.</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop has several selection tools. Choose one of the many selection tools. You might choose the “Pen Tool” or the “Lasso Tool” or anything else. Select the image with the tool by drawing along the image with the tool. And when you are done with tracing the image with the selection tool of your choice, you will see a border marching around the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="selection tool"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 Select the area of the second image</strong></p>
<p>You will need the selection tool again. The second image is the one that consists of the colour you would want the original image to match with. So, use the selection tool again to trace out an area in the second picture with the colour you want.</p>
<p>Ensure that you trace out a substantial area with the colour you need. You need not be highly precise with selecting the area. Instead, focus on covering a large area so that you can cover up the different shades and hues of the colour.</p>

                      alt="select purple"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 Move back to the original picture</strong></p>
<p>We will proceed with the “Colour Match” feature in Photoshop, but before that, you must make sure that you have the original image selected. The technical term to use here is “Focus”. So, ensure that the original image is in focus.</p>
<p>You can bring the original image into “focus” by clicking anywhere inside the document’s window where the original image is present. And that will automatically bring back the focus to the original image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 Bring the “Colour Match” command into function</strong></p>
<p>After selecting the original image, reach out to the “Image” option and click on the “Adjustments” option. You will find the “Match Colour” option; click on it.</p>

The “destination Image” portion consists of the name of the original image and a few image settings as well. The options include “luminescence”, “color intensity”, “fade”, and “neutralize”.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6 Head to the “Image Statistics” portion</strong></p>
<p>The “Image Statistics” portion consists of the “Source” option. It is present in the bottom down part of the “Image Statistics” box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the “Source” option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage"><a href="#Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage"></a>Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage</h2><p>The secret to designing an eye-catching <strong>lightroom collage</strong> is to know how to blend all the elements together properly. Professional Lightroom users concentrate on a few key graphic design considerations to keep their photo collage looking its best.In other words, every element should be in the right proportion, such as dimension, alignment, proximity, and theme.</p>
<p><strong>Balance</strong></p>
<p>Balance refers to the arrangement of all elements. It includes the division of pictures into equal or different dimensions according to the collage size. Maintaining balance enhances the overall appearance of a photo collage in lightroom. Some lightroom experts prefer symmetrical balance, but you can get better quality collages through asymmetrical balance.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong></p>
<p>Don’t underestimate the importance of alignment in <strong>Lightroom collage</strong>. How your pictures are aligned can have a drastic effect on their overall look. It provides a definitive structure and delivers a well-finished product to the client.</p>
<p>In graphic design, two kinds of elements exist: edge and centre alignment. These are applied to visual design and text as well.</p>
<p><strong>Proximity</strong></p>
<p>Proximity signifies the relationship between various elements on the basis of the distance between them. It follows two basic principles:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Realistic pictures should be put together.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unrelatable images should be separated.</p>
<p>Moreover, the border width needs to be consistent throughout, irrespective of the number of pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
<p>The theme, also known as tone or style, matters when it comes to collage design. Each image must have a similar style, as this idea can personify all the captured memories. It will completely beautify your artistic perspective, but it’s not as measurable as others.</p>

It now features an animated split-screen effect that converts multiple videos into a single compelling collage. You only have to import the clips that you want in the split-screen preview window to make the video collage. But, for photo collages, the best tool ever is Adobe Lightroom.</p>
<p>You get two options for creating photo collages in Lightroom: using a pre-designed template or creating a new one. It will be a time-consuming process to make an original template, but we will still focus on both. If you want to create a <strong>lightroom collage</strong> of pictures, follow the steps given below.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a New Template</strong></p>
<p>For a beginner, designing their own template can be a complex and hectic process. But, it’s worth it in the end because the final collage will be the result of all your hard work. In addition, you can show your own creative style by designing a new layout template. This way, you can also deliver a unique creation to your client. Maybe they will end up paying you more as a reward. If you are up for it, then go read the steps to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import and Edit Photographs</strong></p>
<p>Your first step should be to import the photos into your lightroom before proceeding further. Next, to get a perfect collage, your pictures deserve a final touch, which you can do conveniently with the batch editing feature.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="print module"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Establishing the Workspace</strong></p>
<p>After importing and editing the photos, it’s time to create a workspace. Go to the “Print” panel and then to the “Print Job” menu. At this point, you can adjust the dimension of your collage. Make sure to provide ample space for the photos and borders.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Create a Photo Layout</strong></p>
<p>As you have photos in hand and space for distributing them, start forming individual spaces to place them. Try using individual boxes as per the required size or your choice with the “Add to Package” section. You can find it under the Cell of Print menu. Feel free to experiment with the size, placement, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Photos to the Layout</strong></p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the collage template, now bring all your photos to the layout. It’s pretty easy to do because you just have to click on the photo and drag it to where you want. At the end, rearrange as you want until the final design doesn’t seem pleasing to your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a Pre-designed Template</strong></p>
<p>Want to save some time without compromising on the final quality of the collage? <strong>Make a collage in Lightroom</strong> using a pre-designed template. But remember, you won’t get enough freedom to customize the template. If you are up for creating a collage in Lightroom using a pre-designed template, go through the following points.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import the photos into the program</strong></p>
<p>Here also, you can’t create the collage without adding your photos to Lightroom. Simply click on “File” &gt; “Add Photos” and choose the file location.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Download the collage layout</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Lightroom offers free as well as paid templates to make a <strong>photo collage in Lightroom.</strong> You are free to download any one that appeals to you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Bring in the Template</strong></p>
<p>Click on the “Print” module &gt; “Template Browser” &gt; “Lightroom Templates” menu. Now, import the extracted <strong>Lightroom collage template</strong> using the “Import” button.</p>

                      alt="template browser"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Insert Photos</strong></p>
<p>After finishing up the import of the template, start adding the photos to them. You can reposition them in whatever way you want. And now, you are done. Export the collage if you are satisfied with the position, color, and everything else.</p>

Instagram is far ahead of the competition in this regard. It has played a crucial role in establishing the photo collage as a normal trend.</p>
<p><strong>For the photographer</strong></p>
<p>With a photo collage, a photographer can best showcase his talent. It shows that you can do a lot more than your capabilities, like representing stories by blending colors and elements perfectly. This will help you attract your prospects and convert them into your paying customers.</p>
<p><strong>How do photo collages provide value to the clients?</strong></p>
<p>A photo collage provides visual value to the clients by enhancing the creative process. It can have a profound effect on the way they perceive your art of photography. In fact, your clients will love to see all their memories collected in an attractive photo collage. There are a lot of people that even love to present collages to their loved ones.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage-1"><a href="#Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage"></a>Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage</h2><p>The secret to designing an eye-catching <strong>lightroom collage</strong> is to know how to blend all the elements together properly. Professional Lightroom users concentrate on a few key graphic design considerations to keep their photo collage looking its best.In other words, every element should be in the right proportion, such as dimension, alignment, proximity, and theme.</p>
<p><strong>Balance</strong></p>
<p>Balance refers to the arrangement of all elements. It includes the division of pictures into equal or different dimensions according to the collage size. Maintaining balance enhances the overall appearance of a photo collage in lightroom. Some lightroom experts prefer symmetrical balance, but you can get better quality collages through asymmetrical balance.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong></p>
<p>Don’t underestimate the importance of alignment in <strong>Lightroom collage</strong>. How your pictures are aligned can have a drastic effect on their overall look. It provides a definitive structure and delivers a well-finished product to the client.</p>
<p>In graphic design, two kinds of elements exist: edge and centre alignment. These are applied to visual design and text as well.</p>
<p><strong>Proximity</strong></p>
<p>Proximity signifies the relationship between various elements on the basis of the distance between them. It follows two basic principles:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Realistic pictures should be put together.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unrelatable images should be separated.</p>
<p>Moreover, the border width needs to be consistent throughout, irrespective of the number of pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
<p>The theme, also known as tone or style, matters when it comes to collage design. Each image must have a similar style, as this idea can personify all the captured memories. It will completely beautify your artistic perspective, but it’s not as measurable as others.</p>

It now features an animated split-screen effect that converts multiple videos into a single compelling collage. You only have to import the clips that you want in the split-screen preview window to make the video collage. But, for photo collages, the best tool ever is Adobe Lightroom.</p>
<p>You get two options for creating photo collages in Lightroom: using a pre-designed template or creating a new one. It will be a time-consuming process to make an original template, but we will still focus on both. If you want to create a <strong>lightroom collage</strong> of pictures, follow the steps given below.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a New Template</strong></p>
<p>For a beginner, designing their own template can be a complex and hectic process. But, it’s worth it in the end because the final collage will be the result of all your hard work. In addition, you can show your own creative style by designing a new layout template. This way, you can also deliver a unique creation to your client. Maybe they will end up paying you more as a reward. If you are up for it, then go read the steps to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import and Edit Photographs</strong></p>
<p>Your first step should be to import the photos into your lightroom before proceeding further. Next, to get a perfect collage, your pictures deserve a final touch, which you can do conveniently with the batch editing feature.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="print module"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Establishing the Workspace</strong></p>
<p>After importing and editing the photos, it’s time to create a workspace. Go to the “Print” panel and then to the “Print Job” menu. At this point, you can adjust the dimension of your collage. Make sure to provide ample space for the photos and borders.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Create a Photo Layout</strong></p>
<p>As you have photos in hand and space for distributing them, start forming individual spaces to place them. Try using individual boxes as per the required size or your choice with the “Add to Package” section. You can find it under the Cell of Print menu. Feel free to experiment with the size, placement, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Photos to the Layout</strong></p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the collage template, now bring all your photos to the layout. It’s pretty easy to do because you just have to click on the photo and drag it to where you want. At the end, rearrange as you want until the final design doesn’t seem pleasing to your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a Pre-designed Template</strong></p>
<p>Want to save some time without compromising on the final quality of the collage? <strong>Make a collage in Lightroom</strong> using a pre-designed template. But remember, you won’t get enough freedom to customize the template. If you are up for creating a collage in Lightroom using a pre-designed template, go through the following points.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import the photos into the program</strong></p>
<p>Here also, you can’t create the collage without adding your photos to Lightroom. Simply click on “File” &gt; “Add Photos” and choose the file location.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Download the collage layout</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Lightroom offers free as well as paid templates to make a <strong>photo collage in Lightroom.</strong> You are free to download any one that appeals to you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Bring in the Template</strong></p>
<p>Click on the “Print” module &gt; “Template Browser” &gt; “Lightroom Templates” menu. Now, import the extracted <strong>Lightroom collage template</strong> using the “Import” button.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="template browser"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Insert Photos</strong></p>
<p>After finishing up the import of the template, start adding the photos to them. You can reposition them in whatever way you want. And now, you are done. Export the collage if you are satisfied with the position, color, and everything else.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage-3"><a href="#Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage"></a>Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage</h2><p>The secret to designing an eye-catching <strong>lightroom collage</strong> is to know how to blend all the elements together properly. Professional Lightroom users concentrate on a few key graphic design considerations to keep their photo collage looking its best.In other words, every element should be in the right proportion, such as dimension, alignment, proximity, and theme.</p>
<p><strong>Balance</strong></p>
<p>Balance refers to the arrangement of all elements. It includes the division of pictures into equal or different dimensions according to the collage size. Maintaining balance enhances the overall appearance of a photo collage in lightroom. Some lightroom experts prefer symmetrical balance, but you can get better quality collages through asymmetrical balance.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong></p>
<p>Don’t underestimate the importance of alignment in <strong>Lightroom collage</strong>. How your pictures are aligned can have a drastic effect on their overall look. It provides a definitive structure and delivers a well-finished product to the client.</p>
<p>In graphic design, two kinds of elements exist: edge and centre alignment. These are applied to visual design and text as well.</p>
<p><strong>Proximity</strong></p>
<p>Proximity signifies the relationship between various elements on the basis of the distance between them. It follows two basic principles:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Realistic pictures should be put together.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unrelatable images should be separated.</p>
<p>Moreover, the border width needs to be consistent throughout, irrespective of the number of pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
<p>The theme, also known as tone or style, matters when it comes to collage design. Each image must have a similar style, as this idea can personify all the captured memories. It will completely beautify your artistic perspective, but it’s not as measurable as others.</p>

<p>Now, you can narrate your story with incredible text and title templates in this full-featured video editor. It now features an animated split-screen effect that converts multiple videos into a single compelling collage. You only have to import the clips that you want in the split-screen preview window to make the video collage. But, for photo collages, the best tool ever is Adobe Lightroom.</p>
<p>You get two options for creating photo collages in Lightroom: using a pre-designed template or creating a new one. It will be a time-consuming process to make an original template, but we will still focus on both. If you want to create a <strong>lightroom collage</strong> of pictures, follow the steps given below.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a New Template</strong></p>
<p>For a beginner, designing their own template can be a complex and hectic process. But, it’s worth it in the end because the final collage will be the result of all your hard work. In addition, you can show your own creative style by designing a new layout template. This way, you can also deliver a unique creation to your client. Maybe they will end up paying you more as a reward. If you are up for it, then go read the steps to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import and Edit Photographs</strong></p>
<p>Your first step should be to import the photos into your lightroom before proceeding further. Next, to get a perfect collage, your pictures deserve a final touch, which you can do conveniently with the batch editing feature.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/easy-step-by-step-tutorial-on-creating-a-lightroom-collage-1.jpg"
                      alt="print module"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Establishing the Workspace</strong></p>
<p>After importing and editing the photos, it’s time to create a workspace. Go to the “Print” panel and then to the “Print Job” menu. At this point, you can adjust the dimension of your collage. Make sure to provide ample space for the photos and borders.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Create a Photo Layout</strong></p>
<p>As you have photos in hand and space for distributing them, start forming individual spaces to place them. Try using individual boxes as per the required size or your choice with the “Add to Package” section. You can find it under the Cell of Print menu. Feel free to experiment with the size, placement, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Photos to the Layout</strong></p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the collage template, now bring all your photos to the layout. It’s pretty easy to do because you just have to click on the photo and drag it to where you want. At the end, rearrange as you want until the final design doesn’t seem pleasing to your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a Pre-designed Template</strong></p>
<p>Want to save some time without compromising on the final quality of the collage? <strong>Make a collage in Lightroom</strong> using a pre-designed template. But remember, you won’t get enough freedom to customize the template. If you are up for creating a collage in Lightroom using a pre-designed template, go through the following points.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import the photos into the program</strong></p>
<p>Here also, you can’t create the collage without adding your photos to Lightroom. Simply click on “File” &gt; “Add Photos” and choose the file location.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Download the collage layout</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Lightroom offers free as well as paid templates to make a <strong>photo collage in Lightroom.</strong> You are free to download any one that appeals to you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Bring in the Template</strong></p>
<p>Click on the “Print” module &gt; “Template Browser” &gt; “Lightroom Templates” menu. Now, import the extracted <strong>Lightroom collage template</strong> using the “Import” button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/easy-step-by-step-tutorial-on-creating-a-lightroom-collage-2.jpg"
                      alt="template browser"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Insert Photos</strong></p>
<p>After finishing up the import of the template, start adding the photos to them. You can reposition them in whatever way you want. And now, you are done. Export the collage if you are satisfied with the position, color, and everything else.</p>

The real struggle is in creating the collage. That takes a bit more time, but it’s worth it in the end.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>You can follow any of the above steps to get your desired photo collage. So now, you can reduce your burden with Adobe Lightroom or Wondershare Filmora .</p>

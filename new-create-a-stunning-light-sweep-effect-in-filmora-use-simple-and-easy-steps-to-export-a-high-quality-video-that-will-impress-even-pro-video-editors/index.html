<p><strong>What you need to prepare:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A computer (Windows or macOS)</li>
<li>Your video materials.</li>
<li>Filmora video editor</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>Step 1</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, go ahead and download the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Install it and run the application on your computer.</p>
<p>Step 2</p>
<p>Create a New Project by clicking on the big blue button. Immediately after, go to <strong>File → Project Settings.</strong> Here, make sure the project is in full resolution and 60 fps.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/fps.png"
                      alt="project settings filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3</p>
<p>Select the Titles tab and drag the Default Title to the Timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/title.png"
                      alt="add new title filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4</p>
<p>Double-click on the Default Title inside the Timeline and go to <strong>Advanced.</strong> Here, you can change the text, pick a new font, change its size, and so on. Make sure you change the Color Type to <strong>Gradient Fill.</strong> Choose a color of your own liking. When you’re done customizing it, click on <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/advanced.png"
                      alt="advanced text settings"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5</p>
<p>Right-click on the Default Title clip and select <strong>Copy.</strong> Then, right-click anywhere on the Timeline and select <strong>Paste.</strong> After this, drag the copy of that clip on the Track above it.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="copy clip in filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6</p>
<p>Double-click on the copied Title, go to <strong>Advanced,</strong> and change the Color Type to <strong>Color Fill.</strong> Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-fill.png"
                      alt="color type fill"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7</p>
<p>Next, take a snapshot of the new title. Then, delete the copied Title clip from your Timeline. After this, drag the snapshot into the Timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="snapshot filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8</p>
<p>Double-click on the Snapshot clip and go to the <strong>Mask</strong> tab. From here, select the <strong>Rectangle</strong> mask. Then, rotate it as you see in the image below. Don’t click on OK yet.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="add mask filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 9</p>
<p>Now, look at the settings panel on the left and scroll down. First, change its <strong>Rotation</strong> to <strong>40</strong>. Then, drag the <strong>Blur</strong> bar to <strong>15</strong>. Finally, move the Rectangle mask to the left side like in the image below. Don’t click OK yet.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotation.png"
                      alt="mask settings filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 10</p>
<p>Now, move the Playhead to the starting position on the Timeline. Then, click on the “**+Add**” button to add a keyframe. Next, move the Playhead a few seconds forward and move the Rectangle mask all the way to the right side of the text. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add keyframe filmora"
                ></p>

Its framework helps play almost all the audios, videos, DVDs and various resources available on your systems. Even optimizing the videos and audio as the playback from your devices is possible. There is also a possibility of integrating a number of programs along with the streaming services.</p>
<p>You can even search the album covers. With the functionality of the playlist, you can play a number of films one after the other. This feature is helpful when you have downloaded the whole film in parts or watched different short films. The best part is to know it is not just a video player. It is an editor; yes, you heard it right. VLC is the correct choice for splitting or cutting your videos without facing any difficulties.</p>
<p>The article is a guide about the split of the videos in VLC. There is also a particular description of its alternative: Wondershare Filmora. It is suitable as well as reasonable.</p>
<h2 id="How-can-you-split-the-video-clips-in-VLC"><a href="#How-can-you-split-the-video-clips-in-VLC" class="headerlink" title="How can you split the video clips in VLC?"></a>How can you split the video clips in VLC?</h2><p>VLC Media player has all the amazing tools for playing back the audios and videos regardless of the format. It is still on top of all the media players because of its simple interface. Below are the very easy steps to split the videos in the VLC media player.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> After completing the download, install the updated version of the VLC media player if it is not on your PC. Once it is installed, you need to double click on its icon for launching it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> This step is the activation of the advanced controls in the media player. Click on “View” visible on the menu bar. Click on the “Advanced Controls” and appears the menu of four additional buttons more than the button for play or pause.</p>

                      alt="split clip in vlc"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, you can easily play the video simply by clicking the “Open File” option present in the media menu. The drag and drop option is available inside the VLC media player.</p>
<p>You should start playing the video now and recording the parts with the help of a decoder. Look for the position from where you want to begin the recording and press both Play and Pause buttons one after the other.</p>
<p>Even the Frame-by-Frame button is also available. It is the last one in the advance controls for navigating the actual frame from where you want to begin the recording.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Press the button “Record” again whenever you want the recording to stop. This is the final step for cutting the videos in VLC. The split video from the actual video saves automatically as the MP4 video file in the folder of Libraries or Videos if you are using Windows operating system.</p>
<p>Almost all, playing any video and audio format is possible in VLC media player. It includes AVI, MP4, FLV, WMV, RMVB and Quick time. You can even play the videos partially or preview them even before completing the downloads.</p>

But unfortunately, you can apply the frame-by-frame technique on the short videos. Monitoring is essential during the split and looking at the complete process whenever the recording is in VLC.</p>

You can easily enlarge the whole screen with just a few clicks with this guide of how-to un-zoom on mac; which is useful for anybody with poor vision in particular. Users of the macOS operating system may zoom in and out on tiny, difficult-to-read text and pictures in a variety of ways. Would you want to interact closely with anything on your Mac? Maybe you’d like to see things from a broader angle so you would require a <strong>how to zoom out on Mac</strong> tutorial.</p><p>In any case, you have our support. There are various ways to zoom in and out on a Mac, whether you want to do it for the whole screen or just a specific window. For your benefit, we went through many different methods to zoom out on a Mac today. Apple provides a wide range of customizing possibilities. We’ll provide you practical advice on how to utilize your keyboard, mouse, trackpad, or browser to zoom in MacBook. Let’s get started straight now without further ado.</p><h2 id="Way-1-Use-Keyboard-Shortcuts"><a href="#Way-1-Use-Keyboard-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="Way 1: Use Keyboard Shortcuts"></a>Way 1: Use Keyboard Shortcuts</h2><p>When using an app, holding down Command key while using the plus (+) or minus (-) keys will allow you to zoom in or out as needed. Using the keyboard on your Mac, you may zoom in and out at intervals of 10%; when you do, a pop-up menu with the option to reset (i.e., return to the default, or 100%, zoom level) will display at the top of the screen. Instead of touching or repeating the shortcut, just keep holding the plus or minus key to zoom farther. Accessibility Zoom, which was created as a tool for the blind and enables you to zoom in on a Mac to see tiny text and precisely change settings with checkboxes, must be enabled if you wish to zoom in on the whole screen rather than just an app window (such as Utilities).</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Use-Keyboard-Shortcut-to-Zoom-in-MacBook"><a href="#Steps-to-Use-Keyboard-Shortcut-to-Zoom-in-MacBook" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Use Keyboard Shortcut to Zoom in MacBook"></a>Steps to Use Keyboard Shortcut to Zoom in MacBook</h3><p>Step1Go to Accessibility &gt; System Preferences &gt; Zoom, then click Zoom in the sidebar. Check the check next to “Use keyboard shortcuts to zoom” after that. Click the command key (located on either side of the space bar).</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/open-zoom-from-accessibility.jpg" alt="how to zoom in/out on mac"></p><p>Step2Press the plus&#x2F;equal sign (“+ &#x3D;”) button, which is adjacent to the delete button on the top right side of the keyboard, while continuing to hold down the command button to zoom in.</p><p>Step3Press the dash&#x2F;underscore button (“- _“), which is situated next to the “+ &#x3D;” button on the top right side of the keyboard, while still holding down the command button, to zoom out.</p><h2 id="Way-2-Use-Trackpad-Gestures"><a href="#Way-2-Use-Trackpad-Gestures" class="headerlink" title="Way 2: Use Trackpad Gestures"></a>Way 2: Use Trackpad Gestures</h2><p>You may quickly learn how to zoom in on a Mac using trackpad movements if you prefer using a touchpad versus learning any kind of keyboard shortcuts. With a MacBook, there is another, maybe simpler way to zoom in and out in addition to the approach mentioned above. If your keyboard isn’t entirely working, it may still be helpful. However, make sure that gesture support is turned on in the settings on your Mac. Although a Mac still supports the usage of a mouse, new Mac software is designed to be used with a trackpad. Apple is abandoning the mouse. And with a little practice, you can do it too. What you must do is as follows:</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Enable-Trackpad-Gestures"><a href="#Steps-to-Enable-Trackpad-Gestures" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Enable Trackpad Gestures"></a>Steps to Enable Trackpad Gestures</h3><p>Step1Open System Preferences and choose Trackpad. Next, choose the Scroll &amp; Zoom tab and select the “Smart zoom” checkbox. Zooming in on web sites, photos, and documents couldn’t be much simpler after gesture support was set up:</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/trackpad-scroll-zoom.jpg" alt="how to zoom in/out on mac"></p><p>Step2You can zoom in or out on Mac by placing two fingers on the touchpad and moving one finger closer to the other or further apart (repeat for additional zooming)</p><p>Step3Another option is to simply zoom in and out by double-tapping the touchpad with two fingers.</p><h2 id="Way-3-Use-Scroll-Gesture"><a href="#Way-3-Use-Scroll-Gesture" class="headerlink" title="Way 3: Use Scroll Gesture"></a>Way 3: Use Scroll Gesture</h2><p>If you’d like to use your mouse, you may utilize the screen zoom option, which enlarges everything on your screen rather than just the app window you’re now viewing. This would need holding down one of the designated modifier keys while scrolling in order to zoom in on a Mac. Just like on an iPhone or iPad, you can zoom in and out by pinching and un-pinching. The smart zoom motion, on the other hand, is executed by double-tapping with two fingers. This immediately zooms into or immediately zooms out of a web page or pdf.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Enable-Scroll-Gesture"><a href="#Steps-to-Enable-Scroll-Gesture" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Enable Scroll Gesture"></a>Steps to Enable Scroll Gesture</h3><p>Step1To make this feature active, from the Apple menu, choose System Preferences and select Accessibility.

One of your alternatives is to enable zooming while hovering over text. The “Enable Hover Text” option is part of the Zoom menu but does not directly magnify the display. The function allows users to use the Command key to momentarily enlarge just the text below the pointer and is accessible without Zoom having to be activated. When Hover Text is enabled on your Mac, you may drag the cursor over anything on the screen, such as text, input fields, menu items, or buttons, and a high-resolution magnified version of those objects will appear in a new window. Find out here how to make Hover Text available on your Mac:</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Use-Hover-Text-to-Zoom"><a href="#Steps-to-Use-Hover-Text-to-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Use Hover Text to Zoom"></a>Steps to Use Hover Text to Zoom</h3><p>Step1When you choose this option, a larger, higher-resolution picture of the text your cursor is over will show as long as you press and hold down the “Command” key. Click “Options” to modify the text’s appearance.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/enable-hover-text-to-zoom.jpg" alt="how to zoom in/out on mac"></p><p>Step2Additional customization options are available in the Options menu, including the ability to alter the font, the size of the zoomed-in text (which may range from 14pt to 128pt), the font’s appearance surrounding the cursor, and the modifier key that activates the function.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/customize-text-options.jpg" alt="how to zoom in/out on mac"></p><h2 id="Way-5-Enable-Touch-Bar"><a href="#Way-5-Enable-Touch-Bar" class="headerlink" title="Way 5: Enable Touch Bar"></a>Way 5: Enable Touch Bar</h2><p>This substitute is only accessible on Macs equipped with Touch Bars. A handy feature is the Touch Bar. The Touch Bar is a feature on every current MacBook Pro model, including the 13-inch and 16-inch versions. On the Touch Bar, there is a mix of App Controls and a Control Strip. To use with your compatible MacBook Pro, the Touch Bar has additional features. Although it is helpful right out of the box, some customization may be required for your advantage. Fortunately, Apple makes modifications rather straightforward. You may change your default by following the instructions below.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Enable-Touch-Bar-on-MacBook"><a href="#Steps-to-Enable-Touch-Bar-on-MacBook" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Enable Touch Bar on MacBook"></a>Steps to Enable Touch Bar on MacBook</h3><p>Step1The Touch Bar at the bottom of your display will grow and become easier to view if you choose the “Enable Touch Bar zoom” option. Now all you have to do is touch and hold the Touch Bar to test it out.</p><p>Step2Click the Apple symbol in the upper left corner of your screen and choose “System Preferences” to activate the touch bar in another method.</p><p>Step3Select “Keyboard” &gt; “Keyboard” and then select “Touch Bar shows” under the Touch Bar settings. Then choose an option from the menu, which also includes the larger Control Strip and app buttons.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/enable-touch-bar-on-mac.jpg" alt="how to zoom in/out on mac"></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Even the most experienced Mac users sometimes get lost and google topics that should be obvious, like how to zoom in and out on a Mac. But it’s also not as evident as you may believe. You’ll be astonished by how many options there are for zooming on a Mac.

Adobe After Effects is a significant video editing software that is used to add animating effects, transitions, intros, outros, and visual effects. You can launch this software on Windows and Mac effectively. Using this high-end software allows you to work on team projects as it consists of auto-saving features.</p><p>Moreover, you can add adjustment layers on After Effects to make your video editing more efficient. If you don’t know <strong>what the adjustment layer in After Effects is</strong>, this article will help you. By reading this article, you can easily learn how to create adjustment layers in your video clips using After Effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/adjustment-layers-in-after-effects-1.jpg"                      alt="after effects featured image"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Adjustment-Layer-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Adjustment-Layer-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the Adjustment Layer in After Effects?"></a>Part 1: What is the Adjustment Layer in After Effects?</h2><p>The adjustment layer can save you time and energy from adding effects to multiple clips individually. It does not alter the composition of your video clip until you start applying the effects. Once you add the effect in the adjustment layer, it will replace the effect on all the layers under it.</p><p>You can add the adjustment layers in your timeline for creating visual effects such as film grain or color grading. Using the adjustment layer, you can produce transition effects by adding effects to shorter compositions. However, if you want to use the adjustment layer properly, you should select its position carefully in the layer’s stack.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/adjustment-layers-in-after-effects-2.jpg"                      alt="adjustment layer in after effects"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1834906">                    <video width="864" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834906.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1834906">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834906.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1834906%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1834906/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Moreover, always keep in mind that anything placed under the adjustment layer will have a direct effect.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="What-Is-the-Best-Frame-Rate-for-4K-Videos"><a href="#What-Is-the-Best-Frame-Rate-for-4K-Videos" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Best Frame Rate for 4K Videos?"></a>What Is the Best Frame Rate for 4K Videos?</h2><p>People in the videography ad filmmaking world use complicated terminology like Ultra High Def to describe 4K videos. Even though you are not a complete stranger to the term 4K, you might still be unaware of what it means.</p><p>In a nutshell, 4K is the highest resolution you can watch your movies and videos. The details are incredibly crisp, meaning you can see pimples or the pores on an actor’s face through the screen. However, the frame rate will significantly affect how you enjoy a 4K video. Therefore, it would be wise to learn how to choose the ideal frame rate to suit your needs.</p><p>Keep reading this article to learn more about frame rates and which is suitable for a 4K video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4k-video-frame-rate.jpg"                      alt="4k video frame rate"                ></p><h2 id="How-Do-Frame-Rates-Affect-Video-Viewing"><a href="#How-Do-Frame-Rates-Affect-Video-Viewing" class="headerlink" title="How Do Frame Rates Affect Video Viewing?"></a>How Do Frame Rates Affect Video Viewing?</h2><p>The motion will appear smoother if your video contains more frames per second. Even though your viewers are not tech-savvy, they will definitely notice the difference.</p><p>Consider a video of a duck drinking water from a pond. If you film and playback the same video in 24, 30, and 60fps, you will see a noticeable difference, assuming your shutter speed is set according to the 180-degree shutter rule.</p><p>If you are filming quicker motions of wildlife and birds, you are better off sticking to higher resolutions to give the viewer a pleasant experience and ensure the motion is fluid.</p><p>On the other hand, lower frame rates like 24fps are ideal for human movements, which are not as smooth as wildlife. Suppose you used 60fps for a cinematic film or a TV show. The video would look a bit odd because that is not how we see things in the natural world. In addition, your viewers aren’t used to such smoothness.</p><h2 id="Viewing-Requirements-of-4K-Videos"><a href="#Viewing-Requirements-of-4K-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Viewing Requirements of 4K Videos"></a>Viewing Requirements of 4K Videos</h2><p>You may have heard about 4K videos and wondered what people mean by that term. In simple terms, a 4K video is a high-resolution video that is four times the usual 1080p HD video. When it comes to 4K videos, there are two standard resolutions. One of them is the standard for Digital Cinema which is 4096*2160 pixels. The other is for television and is 3840*2160 pixels.</p><p>To stream 4K content, you need a bandwidth between 10 and 20 Mbps. On the other hand, streaming platforms like Netflix require higher bandwidths of not less than 15 Mbps. In addition to the bandwidth we mentioned earlier, you need a 4KTV or 4K monitor.</p><p>This specification was brought up at the UHD Alliance, a union of more than 50 tech companies working together to support 4K content. Tech companies ought to ensure the devices they produce are compatible with 4K videos, which are becoming increasingly popular.</p><p>Below is a list of requirements any electronic device should fulfill before being termed a 4KTV or 4K monitor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4k-video-requirements.jpg"                      alt="requirements of 4k videos"                ></p><ul><li>A resolution of not less than 3840*2160.</li><li>A 10-bit color depth that allows for 1,024 shades of red, yellow, and blue.</li><li>A high dynamic range for color accuracy.</li><li>An excellent combination of black level and peak brightness. The peak brightness should not exceed 1,000 nits, and the black level shouldn’t go below 0.5 nits. Alternatively, the peak brightness shouldn’t exceed 540 nits; neither should the black level plummet below 0.0005 nits.</li></ul><h2 id="Best-Frame-Rate-for-4K-Video"><a href="#Best-Frame-Rate-for-4K-Video" class="headerlink" title="Best Frame Rate for 4K Video"></a>Best Frame Rate for 4K Video</h2><p>We all know that the frame rate you choose for your video will significantly impact the viewer’s experience and the overall style of your video. The frame rate will also affect how the video looks. For instance, a frame rate lower than 24fps will make your video look unprofessional and of poor quality. The content will also flicker because there aren’t many still images per second.</p><p>On the other hand, a lower FPS causes the file size to be smaller, causing it to consume a lower bandwidth. The vice versa is also true. Now that you understand these facts, you might wonder which frame rate would be best for your 4K videos.</p><p>Research reveals that the most acceptable frame rate is 30fps and 60fps. This is because the motion will appear natural to the human eye without being too fast or unrealistic.</p><p>If you are wondering what is the best frame rate for 4k videos, we urge you to select 60fps because it contains more detail. The higher frame rate also makes the motion look very smooth and crisp. Perhaps you want to shoot a slow-motion video. In that case, an even higher frame rate of 120fps would be ideal.</p><h2 id="How-To-Choose-The-Base-Frame-Rates-for-Your-Next-Video"><a href="#How-To-Choose-The-Base-Frame-Rates-for-Your-Next-Video" class="headerlink" title="How To Choose The Base Frame Rates for Your Next Video"></a>How To Choose The Base Frame Rates for Your Next Video</h2><p>Choosing a frame rate for your videos is not complicated. However, it is not a straightforward process either. There are numerous moving parts that ought to work harmoniously for your video to turn out perfect and guarantee your audience will have a pleasant viewing experience. Before we dive into choosing the best frame rate for your 4K videos, let’s help you understand the filmmaking process.</p><p>Most filmmakers and videographers see it fit to shoot videos in 120p or 4K. This step makes their work easier during the editing process. If the raw footage is in 4K, they can de-emphasize or retain specific plot points that would look great in the final video. However, not everyone is shooting a video for Hollywood. Therefore, shooting in 4K on your laptop for your YouTube channel might be difficult.</p><p>Below are some factors you should consider when choosing the best frame rate for a 4k video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/factors-for-choosing-frame-rate.jpg"                      alt="factors for choosing frame rate for videos"                ></p><h4 id="File-size"><a href="#File-size" class="headerlink" title="File size"></a>File size</h4><p>Shooting your video at a higher frame rate means more still images are packed into a single second of the video. Therefore, you will end up with a larger file size. If you want to shoot a video for your YouTube channel, it would be wise to stick to a smaller frame rate.</p><h4 id="Purpose"><a href="#Purpose" class="headerlink" title="Purpose"></a>Purpose</h4><p>It wouldn’t make sense to shoot a talking head video at more than 24fps. However, a higher frame rate would be ideal for a travel vlog, where the details need to be crisp.</p><h4 id="Medium-of-delivery"><a href="#Medium-of-delivery" class="headerlink" title="Medium of delivery"></a>Medium of delivery</h4><p>The standard frame rate for television is 24fps.

As many video editing pros present on Tiktok, the miniature effect is a fun way to brighten up your photography or video shots. For example, when taking a video or a time-lapse of a landscape, we always have a bigger depth of field, so most objects in the frame are in focus.</p><p>However, when we film a miniature model, the depth of field is shallow. So, we only see some objects in focus, and the rest is blurry. This visual trick makes our brain believe that the big landscape we’re seeing is actually a tiny model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-2.jpg"                      alt="a miniature effect for landscape"                ></p><p>To create a miniature look, we can use specific effects to fake a shallow depth of field, and then the landscape view will look like a tiny model. While some keys to notice before making the miniature effect are:</p><ul><li>It utilizes <strong>selective blur</strong> to make things appear like <strong>small</strong></li><li>The miniature effect works best for footage filmed from <strong>a high angle</strong>.</li><li>The tiny effect is usually used in <strong>drone footage, time lapses</strong>, or <strong>landscape photography</strong>.</li></ul><p>Are you all set to add miniature effects to your video and make film-like shots?

Everything You Need to Know About HDRI"></a>What Is HDRI? Everything You Need to Know About HDRI</h2><p>Photography is like art itself. Photographers must carefully select the setting and use the right camera to capture images with lossless quality. However, you’ll realize that some photos appear darker or brighter than in actual life.</p><p>In that case, use <strong>free HDRI</strong> software to change that straightway. But HDRI being a relatively new technique, beginners might struggle to edit the photos, let alone find the perfect HDRI software.</p><p>So, in this simple guidepost, we’ll learn how to create an HDRI 3D picture using <strong>HDRI for Blender</strong>. But first, let’s understand what an HDRI file is and the difference between HDRI and HDR.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-HDRI"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-HDRI" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is HDRI?"></a>Part 1: What is HDRI?</h2><p>HDRI (High Dynamic Range Image) is simply an image created using multiple image overlays of the same background but with varying exposures. The exposures can range from the brightest highlights to the darkest shadows. So, in short, HDRI expands an image’s dynamic range to brighten or darken it and make it look more natural.</p><p>Having said that, HDRI is a raster image created using color pixels. HDRI photos are generally significant in size, so they won’t quickly lose quality like other raster photos such as PNG and JPG. Many formats can store HDRI images, although the most common are OpenEXR (.exr) and Radiance RGBE (.hdr).</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>You can easily create one using HDRI for Blender, Photoshop, EasyHDRI, etc.</li><li>HDRI photos are compatible with many image editing programs.</li><li>Produces crisp images with excellent detail and lighting control.</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>32-bit HDRI files have significant sizes.</li><li>HDRI can quickly be poorly done without prior experience.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-What’s-the-difference-between-HDR-and-HDRI"><a href="#Part-2-What’s-the-difference-between-HDR-and-HDRI" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What’s the difference between HDR and HDRI"></a>Part 2: What’s the difference between HDR and HDRI</h2><p>According to Wikipedia, HDR and HDRI are the same things. But is it true? For starters, HDRI is basically a photo with High Dynamic Range qualities. So, yes, HDR and HDRI can mean the same thing in digital image editing.</p><p>However, some photo editors argue that there is a difference between these two regarding basic workflow. First, HDR technology increases brightness to show more image details. On the other hand, HDRI performs unique optimization of content and lighting to deliver crisp images. In other words, HDRI brightens the dark shadows without necessarily overexposing the bright image areas.</p><p>Some photographers can also consider HDR as images with pixel values higher than 1 or 255. That means that the pixels can be much higher than pure white. But technically speaking, HDR and HDRI can be used interchangeably.</p><h2 id="Part-3-When-to-use-HDRI"><a href="#Part-3-When-to-use-HDRI" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: When to use HDRI"></a>Part 3: When to use HDRI</h2><p>Now that you have all the information about HDRI, let’s learn about some industries where HDRI is applicable.</p><h3 id="1-HDRI-for-3D-visualization-and-3D-animation"><a href="#1-HDRI-for-3D-visualization-and-3D-animation" class="headerlink" title="1.

HDRI for 3D visualization and 3D animation</h3><p><strong>HDRI 3D</strong> is commonplace these days. 3D animation creators can use programs like <strong>HDRI Blender</strong> to add HDR environments and make the content look detailed and more realistic in high lighting reflections. To put it simply, HDRI makes 3D scenes look lighter, less cartoonish, and more professional. This technology can also be used in interior visualizations in animations.</p><h3 id="2-HDRI-for-architect-rendering"><a href="#2-HDRI-for-architect-rendering" class="headerlink" title="2.

These TVs offer a lot more than just a wide color gamut, high brightness, and advanced contrast ratio. In addition, HDR TVs and monitors can recognize HDR signals, allowing viewers to watch the content with all studio quality. In short, viewers can see more color details in shadowy and lighter scenes, making them perfect for avid gamers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2120865/26400?prodsku=mercury" target="_top" id="2120865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2120865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2120865/26400?prodsku=mercury"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-do-you-open-an-HDRI"><a href="#Part-4-How-do-you-open-an-HDRI" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How do you open an HDRI?"></a>Part 4: How do you open an HDRI?</h2><p>Because HDRIs use low dynamic range rendering, a standard display panel won’t open HDR images. So, to open an HDRI file on a non-HDR display, you’ll need to convert it to a different low dynamic range format using tone mapping technology. For example, you convert HDRI to JPEG or PNG and enjoy regular bitmaps while maintaining the HDRI properties. You can also open and edit HDRI using desktop programs like EasyHDR, Photoshop, and Blender.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-set-up-an-HDR-environment-background"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-set-up-an-HDR-environment-background" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to set up an HDR environment background?"></a>Part 5: How to set up an HDR environment background?</h2><p>Before wrapping up this blog post, let’s discuss how to use <a class="link"   href="https://www.blender.org/" >HDRI for Blender <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to apply HDR effects to an image’s background. Blender is a 100% free program for creating jaw-dropping 3D rendering and animations on Mac and Windows computers.

Then, click the Color icon and add Environment Texture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/free-hdri-blender-1.jpg"                      alt="free hdri for blender open world properties"                ></p><p>Step2Next, split the window into two and launch the Shader Editor tool. Then, open the Object drop-down menu at the top-left corner and choose World. You’ll see the Environment Texture hooked into the background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/free-hdri-blender-2.jpg"                      alt="free hdri for blender open shader editor"                ></p><p>Step3On the Environment Texture, tap Open Image before opening the 3.2 folder inside the Blender Foundation folder. Then, click Data files &gt; Studiolights &gt; Word. Now open a .exr file. For example, open the Interior.exr image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/free-hdri-blender-3.jpg"                      alt="free hdri for blender open exr file"                ></p><p>Step4Click the Viewport Shading icon and tap the drop-down button to choose Interior. You’ll see all the lighting reflections inside the room and customize it as you wish. That’s it!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/free-hdri-blender-4.jpg"                      alt="free hdri for blender open viewport shading"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Using the environment maps is the simplest and most effective way to lighten up your 3D scenes in Blender. This program lets you achieve realistic 3D scenes, mimicking natural world lighting. But note that Blender can be a little confusing for beginners.

It includes reasons why the sites are suitable alternatives and brief guides on how to get started on them.</p><h2 id="Part1-What-are-the-best-alternatives-to-Pexels"><a href="#Part1-What-are-the-best-alternatives-to-Pexels" class="headerlink" title="Part1: What are the best alternatives to Pexels?"></a>Part1: What are the best alternatives to Pexels?</h2><p>There are several factors to consider when selecting a suitable image resource for your messaging. For example, you may consider a site favorable to another because of its intuitive user interface, or you may consider another because it has no pesky advertisements. Taking this into consideration, here is a list of the three best Pexels alternatives worth checking out for your next project.</p><h3 id="No-1-Unsplash"><a href="#No-1-Unsplash" class="headerlink" title="No.1 Unsplash"></a>No.1 Unsplash</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-1.jpg"                      alt="unsplash"                ></p><p>Unsplash is a stock photo-sharing website run by Getty Images. According to recent reports, the site hosts over 265,000 photographers contributing to a library of over 3.5 million photos. Initially, all photos were under a creative commons license zero, meaning you could distribute the photos without restriction. However, following lobbying from some creators, all photos are now under the Unsplash license.</p><p>This means you can still copy, modify, share, and download images for free. However, under the new licensing terms, you cannot use unedited copies of the images for commercial purposes such as T-Shirt printing or branding and using the photos on a similar or competing service.</p><p>Most Unsplash users praise it for the following features:</p><ul><li>The library contains tons of high-resolution photos.</li><li>You can access the site through your web browser or the app available on Android and iOS devices.</li><li>There are no download limits to the photos, and everything is free.</li><li>Unsplash is a plugin for various content editing software such as Filmora 11, Adobe XD, and Figma.</li></ul><p>Despite all the positives, here are a few improvements to make Unsplash even better.</p><ul><li>The website lacks a free HD video library, which would be a great addition for aspiring content creators.</li><li>In addition, the search algorithm is not as accurate, and you may struggle to find suitable images for your subject matter.</li></ul><h3 id="No-2-Shutterstock"><a href="#No-2-Shutterstock" class="headerlink" title="No.2 Shutterstock"></a>No.2 Shutterstock</h3><p>Another Pexels alternative to consider is Shutterstock. It is an online resource where individuals and businesses can access high-quality, licensed photos, videos, illustrations, vectors, and music for their content creation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-2.jpg"                      alt="shutterstock"                ></p><p>Unlike Unsplash above, you need to create an account to access Shutterstock services. In addition, the website offers different pricing models for each user, depending on your unique requirements. For example, you can subscribe to an image-only subscription that allows you ten image downloads monthly for $29. Alternatively, you can purchase the Mix and Match subscription that offers you 25 credits monthly to download different media from the site.</p><p>Currently, the website boasts a collection of over 200 million royalty-free images and over 10 million video clips.

Tips to use green screen on Zoom video"></a>Part 3. Tips to use green screen on Zoom video</h2><p>Here are some important tips to use green screen on Zoom video for a better outcome.</p><p>Buy Large Green Screen - Since you are going to invest in buying green screen, you should buy a large green screen instead of buying two. Firstly, when you have one large green screen, you can set it up without any wrinkles or overlaps.</p><p>Secondly, a large green screen means greater surface area, and even when you slightly change the angle of your camera, your background will still have green screen instead of the exterior wall showing up and ruining virtual background effect.</p><p>Buy Green Screen Stand - Along with green screen, you should buy a sizeable green screen stand. A regular green screen stand contains two vertical supports at both ends and one horizontal support where you hand the green screen.</p><p>You can buy it according to the size of green screen you have bought. And you need to buy stand because you cannot fix the green screen on the wall properly. If you use any other means, there are going to be wrinkles and uneven virtual background effect.</p><p>Green Screen Quality - You can purchase any shade of green screen, but we recommend you opt for vibrant green color for a better outcome. Most importantly, the color should be even across the surface, and there should not be light and dark patches to dampen the virtual background effect and make it look unrealistic. That is why you should not compromise with quality.</p><p>Avoid Green Objects - You should not wear anything green. If your green screen has a lighter shade, you can wear deep color dresses and vice versa. Most importantly, you should not keep anything that is green while attending Zoom attending as it will disturb the green screen effect and it will look embarrassing. If you need to keep any green objects in your Zoom meetings, you should have blue screen instead of green screen.</p><p>Focus On Lighting - Lighting is extremely important when you want to use green screen. You should place the light so that it spreads evenly across the green screen. Otherwise, there are going to be light and dark patches, and the effect can get disturbed. Make sure you do not cast any shadow on the green screen by positioning the green screen accordingly.</p><p>Select A Proper Background - Last but not least, when you change your green screen to any virtual background photo or video, make sure you keep your audiences in mind.

Silence in videos can often be a major drawback, making the content dull and unengaging. However, fear not because there are ways to eliminate them and keep your viewers hooked. One effective solution is to utilize certain features that help in removing silence from videos.</p><p><strong>Silence detection</strong> is a feature that lets you detect silence and awkward pauses in your content. It can detect those instances where there is no audio or any significant sound present. By utilizing this feature, you can easily identify and remove these silent parts from your videos. Wondershare Filmora is a tool that offers this AI-powered feature to <strong>remove silence from videos</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-Can-Silencing-in-Videos-Damage-It"><a href="#Part-1-How-Can-Silencing-in-Videos-Damage-It" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How Can Silencing in Videos Damage It?"></a>Part 1: How Can Silencing in Videos Damage It?</h2><p>Silence can negatively affect videos, making them less engaging and captivating. Many <strong>video silence removers</strong> are available, but first, learn how silence affects video content. Let’s explore some of how silence can damage the quality of video content:</p><h3 id="1-Loss-of-Interest"><a href="#1-Loss-of-Interest" class="headerlink" title="1. Loss of Interest"></a>1. Loss of Interest</h3><p>When viewers encounter long silent moments in a video, they lose interest. Silence fails to hold their attention and leaves them craving for something more stimulating. As a result, they may lose interest in the content and look for other videos. This is somewhat discouraging for a content creator. That’s why short and meaningful content is what the audience demand.</p><h3 id="2-Lack-of-Emotional-Connection"><a href="#2-Lack-of-Emotional-Connection" class="headerlink" title="2. Lack of Emotional Connection"></a>2. Lack of Emotional Connection</h3><p>Sound and audio play an essential role in creating an emotional connection with the audience. Silence, on the other hand, fails to start any emotional response. Without appropriate sound effects or dialogue, videos can feel empty and emotionless. The absence of audio elements also fails to establish a connection with the viewer.</p><h3 id="3-Breaks-the-Flow"><a href="#3-Breaks-the-Flow" class="headerlink" title="3. Breaks the Flow"></a>3. Breaks the Flow</h3><p>Silent moments in videos can disrupt the natural flow and rhythm of the content. Viewers expect a seamless progression from one scene to another. However, sudden silences in a video may create frustration for some individuals. It may also lead to a disjointed viewing experience for the viewer. Meanwhile, the audience sometimes couldn’t understand the intended message.</p><h3 id="4-Awkwardness-and-Uncomfortable-Silence"><a href="#4-Awkwardness-and-Uncomfortable-Silence" class="headerlink" title="4. Awkwardness and Uncomfortable Silence"></a>4. Awkwardness and Uncomfortable Silence</h3><p>Silence can create awkward moments in videos, especially when it’s unexpected or prolonged. These silent gaps can make viewers feel uncomfortable. The viewer becomes unsure of what to expect or how to interpret the situation. Moreover, awkward silences can detract from the overall viewing experience. It also leaves a negative impression and makes the content less enjoyable.</p><h3 id="5-Reduced-Engagement-and-Sharing"><a href="#5-Reduced-Engagement-and-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="5. Reduced Engagement and Sharing"></a>5. Reduced Engagement and Sharing</h3><p>Videos that contain excessive silence are less likely to be shared or discussed among viewers. Silent moments fail to generate excitement or spark conversations. In contrast, videos with dynamic audio elements are more likely to capture attention. If your video has long pauses or awkward silent moments, it may not get the expected response.</p><p><strong>Video Slience Detector</strong></p><p>Easily and precisely detect slience in video with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>!

Even though OBS is a completely free application, its features are comparable to any premium video editor. We always look for available transition effects in a video editor and OBS takes it to the next level by allowing users to add custom transitions.</p><p>Among custom transitions, Stinger transitions have gained a lot of traction from the users. Stinger transitions are made popular by sports channels who use Stinger frequently whenever there is a change in the scene. We will illustrate how to add custom transitions in OBS and apply Stinger transitions in your video.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Stinger-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Stinger-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Stinger in OBS"></a>Part 1. What is Stinger in OBS</h2><p>Stinger is a special type of customized animated video transition effect that is available in the latest version of OBS Studio. It is a combination of a transparent video animation and a cut transition. Stinger begins with the transparent video animation that grows into full-screen overlay, and it is followed by the cut transition. After the cut transition, you place the next scene or video clip. You will notice Stinger transition whenever sports channels show an instant replay during a live match.</p><p>The transparent video animation starts on top of the current video you are editing. When the animation expands and covers up the entire screen, you place the cut transition, and thereafter, you place the next video clip or scene as per your requirement. Some customized stinger effect also includes audio effects along with video effect.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-add-stinger-transitions-to-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-add-stinger-transitions-to-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to add stinger transitions to OBS"></a>Part 2. How to add stinger transitions to OBS</h2><p>The Stinger transition is available on OBS Studio and Streamlabs, and both of them are open-source and free applications. Before you add stinger transition, you should have a video animation ready that you will play on top of the current video followed by the cut transition effect. You can download several stinger video animations from the internet and include any of them in OBS while adding stinger transition. Here are the steps on how to add a custom transition to OBS.</p><p>Step1 Go to Scene Transitions section and click on Effects option to open the drop-down menu.</p><p>Step2 From the drop-down menu, click on “Add: Stinger” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-stinger-obs.jpg"                      alt="add stinger obs"                ></p><p>Step3 Give a name to the Stinger transition and click Ok button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/name-stinger-transition-obs.jpg"                      alt="name stinger transition obs"                ></p><p>Step4 You will see Properties window now. Click on Browser button against Video file and select the transparent video animation file that you want to play on top of the current video before applying the cut transition effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/apply-cut-transition-effects.jpg"                      alt="apply cut transition effects"                ></p><p>Step5 For Transition Point Type, select Time(milliseconds) option. In the Transition Point field, add the duration of the transparent video animation so that the transition to the next scene takes place immediately after the video animation gets completed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-transition-point-field.jpg"                      alt="select transition point field"                ></p><p>Step6 If your video animation has audio, go to Audio Monitoring and select Monitor and Output option from the dropdown. For Audio Fade Style, you can select Crossfade option for better output.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/audio-monitor-output-obs.jpg"                      alt="audio monitor output obs"                ></p><p>Step7 Scroll down and click on Preview Transition button to check if the stinger transition is taking place as expected. You can adjust the transition point and other parameters to get it perfect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/preview-stinger-transition.jpg"                      alt="preview stinger transition"                ></p><p>Step8 Finally, click on Ok button and play the video to check out the stinger transition on the big screen.</p><p>The steps on how to add a custom transition to Streamlabs OBS are almost similar, and therefore, you can add stinger transition using Streamlabs comfortably.</p><h2 id="Part-3-OBS-Alternative-to-Add-Transitions"><a href="#Part-3-OBS-Alternative-to-Add-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Difference-Between-Time-Lapse-and-Hyperlapse"><a href="#Difference-Between-Time-Lapse-and-Hyperlapse" class="headerlink" title="Difference Between Time Lapse and Hyperlapse"></a>Difference Between Time Lapse and Hyperlapse</h2><p>You’ve probably heard the terms “hyperlapse” and “timelapse” before. Whether it was in a blog post, a how-to guide, or on your preferred social media platform. Each of us has seen at least one image of one of them. However, what makes a difference? You’re about to learn in this article!</p><p>With that said, let’s begin!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-timelapse-and-how-is-it-used"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-timelapse-and-how-is-it-used" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is a timelapse, and how is it used?"></a>Part 1. What is a timelapse, and how is it used?</h2><p>Timelapses are familiar to you, whether they were used in a series to demonstrate a swift change from night today or at the beginning of your favorite influencer’s vlog. But exactly what is it? The term “timelapse” refers to a photography method in which static images are stitched together to produce a time-warping video. When the video is played, the time seems to pass more quickly, creating the illusion that time is slipping away.</p><p>Put your camera in a fixed position, stop it from moving, panning, or tilting, then record for a long time to make your own timelapse. This period of time could last for five minutes, an hour, days, or even years. Once the film is gathered, all that’s left to do is speed everything up.</p><p>The fact that time-lapses make for a pleasant visual effect is what makes them so popular in Vlogs and other media. This method enables you to describe the passage of time, the movement of individuals through space, etc. utilizes time-lapse.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/car-light-timelapse-video.jpg"                      alt="car light timelapse video"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-a-hyperlapse"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-a-hyperlapse" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What is a hyperlapse?"></a>Part 2. What is a hyperlapse?</h2><p>On the other side, there are these things that we refer to as hyperlapses. In the subgenre of time-lapse photography known as cinematography, a hyperlapse is a filmmaking method used to generate motion shots by capturing movies rather than taking images. In order to create a hyperlapse, the camera does not remain stationary; rather, it follows the subject around and is typically held by the photographer.</p><p>The amount of time that elapses between pictures in a stop-motion video typically ranges from tenths of a second up to a few fractions of a second, although this can change significantly depending on what you want to show. However, after you have picked it, it must remain consistent in the same way that the timelapse does.</p><p>The attractive 3D look that hyperlapse produces is the primary draw for its utilization. The hyperlapse that is formed can produce a dreamy image, regardless of whether the camera is attached to a moving vehicle or is mounted on a tripod that is moving towards its target.</p><p>Additionally, you may use this approach to make stunning photographs with motion blur by employing long exposures. In most cases, the final image will be stabilized in post-production in order to eliminate some of the flaws that may have been captured in the original photo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/hyperlapse-sky-video.jpg"                      alt="hyperlapse sky video"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-What-differentiates-them-from-each-other"><a href="#Part-3-What-differentiates-them-from-each-other" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What differentiates them from each other?"></a>Part 3. What differentiates them from each other?</h2><p>The movement of the camera is what differentiates these two approaches the most from one another. When capturing a time lapse, the camera is kept relatively still and in the same position throughout. In addition, when you use a hyperlapse, the camera is continuously moving, which creates a 3D appearance in the image.</p><p>You could be scratching your head right about now, wondering when you should employ one of the two methods. If your subject is moving, you should take a time-lapse photograph; if the camera is moving, you should take a hyperlapse photograph. This question has a relatively straightforward answer.</p><p>The act of recording video for a hyperlapse can cause your storage to be filled up really rapidly. Therefore, you may wish to swap between the two methods depending on the length of time that you want to shoot for. If you are going to be filming for a significant amount of time, you should consider using a timelapse.</p><p>It is simple to determine the timelapse interval if you already know these answers. Choose the video’s final frame rate. It may be 24, 25, or 30 fps. You shouldn’t select more quickly. Choose the option that best fits your audience and location. Additionally, a time-lapse calculator is available.</p><p>The shoot time should then be converted to seconds. For instance, two hours are equal to 2 x 60 x 60 seconds, or 7200 seconds. Determine how many frames are required for your chosen timelapse now. For instance, the final product should be 30 seconds of 25fps video. You’ll need to capture 750 frames in total because 30 x 25 is 750.</p><p>Divide the time (7200s in this case) by the number of frames to obtain the interval (750). You can round up the result, which is 9.6, which is pretty near to 10 seconds. Therefore, in our case, your interval should be set to 10s.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Motion-control-timelapse"><a href="#Part-4-Motion-control-timelapse" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Motion control timelapse"></a>Part 4. Motion control timelapse</h2><p>Now that we understand how the timelapse images that are static are created, we are able to incorporate some movement into the shots that are static. Moving the camera around during a timelapse is much more difficult than it appears to be in the video. Every movement of the camera is slowed down when using slow motion, which means that you can make even a shaky handheld movie look good when using slow motion. The situation is completely reversed while viewing a timelapse.</p><p>Because every movement of the camera is sped up, shooting with the handheld mode is nearly impossible. If you want the camera to appear to be moving slowly in the final timelapse, you will need to move it very slowly while shooting in order to achieve this effect.</p><p>For this reason, we will need to make use of motion control devices in order to accomplish our goal. Therefore, we refer to these kinds of photos as motion control timelapses. The camera can be moved very slowly and accurately along one, two, or all three axes using motors that are controlled electronically. The three-axis systems, which include a slider as well as a pan-tilt head, are by far the most popular.</p><h2 id="Extra-Info-Best-Time-Lapse-Video-Maker-–-Filmora"><a href="#Extra-Info-Best-Time-Lapse-Video-Maker-–-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Extra Info: Best Time Lapse Video Maker – Filmora"></a>Extra Info: Best Time Lapse Video Maker – Filmora</h2><p>To create a time lapse video with cool effects, you can use the best video editor with rich effects – <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This software offers many video speed change settings and creative effects to help make a time lapse video easily. Just download the software on your PC or Mac and then start creating a video on your own.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The finest results can be achieved by utilizing a variety of filmmaking approaches concurrently.

So you don’t have to keep re-importing your media for future videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/secret-tips-in-wondershare-filmora-1.png"                      alt="wondershare filmora global media folder"                ></p><p>Moreover, when you have imported files into the <strong>Shared Media Folder,</strong> you can create new <strong>Sub-Folders</strong>.

Customize Proxy Files"></a>Part 2. Customize Proxy Files</h2><p>Before understanding the custom proxy settings, let us know what proxy files are.</p><h3 id="Proxy-Files"><a href="#Proxy-Files" class="headerlink" title="Proxy Files"></a>Proxy Files</h3><p>Proxy files in Wondershare Filmora allow you to render and edit <strong>4K</strong> and other higher-resolution videos easily, regardless of your computer’s processing power.</p><p>No one wants to compromise PC performance when editing videos. But if you are importing a video with a higher resolution than your PC, you can only play it sometimes. Other than that, your PC might get stuck and slow down.</p><p>If your PC has a built-in resolution of <strong>1080p,</strong> but the video you are going to import is <strong>2160p</strong>, you can encounter rendering and performance problems. But in the case of Wondershare Filmora Proxy files, you can smoothly edit your videos without any trouble.</p><h3 id="How-to-Customize-Proxy-Files-in-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Customize-Proxy-Files-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Customize Proxy Files in Filmora"></a>How to Customize Proxy Files in Filmora</h3><p>Although Wondershare Filmora automatically creates proxy files when it encounters resolutions more significant than the PC performance.

Remove Split Button on Playhead"></a>Part 4. Remove Split Button on Playhead</h2><p>In some instances, when you are moving the playhead on the timelines, it can distract you from doing your editing. Or even more, you can mistakenly click on the Split button to split the clips you don’t want them to.</p><p>Well, no worries at all! Wondershare Filmora takes care of that for you. You can hide or remove the Split button on the playhead. It only takes a few simple and easy steps.

Wondershare Filmora comes with a range of commands and features that allow you to save time and be reliable.</p><p>Suppose you want to add an effect to a video clip in the timeline. Then, after adding the effect to your video, make custom changes to make it look more closely to the style you want.

Timeline Snap"></a>Part 6. Timeline Snap</h2><p>You might have added multiple videos in the same timeline track. If you removed the video ahead of the video clip, you have to close the gap in between.</p><p>So, arranging and moving clips in the timeline are hectic and time-consuming. However, that is the case without timeline snapping.</p><h3 id="How-to-Apply-Timeline-Snap-in-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Apply-Timeline-Snap-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Apply Timeline Snap in Filmora"></a>How to Apply Timeline Snap in Filmora</h3><p><strong>Timeline snapping</strong> will allow you to arrange video clips side by side without any breaks and cut-offs.

It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-1.jpg"                      alt="alpha track matte"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Alpha Matte:</strong> <strong>Alpha matte in After Effects</strong> allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.</li><li><strong>Alpha Inverted Matte:</strong> In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.</li><li><strong>Luma Matte:</strong> A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.</li><li><strong>Luma Inverted Matte:</strong> The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-2.jpg"                      alt="luma track matte"                ></p><p>You can use any of the <strong>track mattes in After Effects</strong> according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:</p><h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.</p><h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Go to the “Modes” column and open the dropdown menu next to “Layer List.” Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-3.jpg"                      alt="select track matte layer"                ></p><h5 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>You will see two toggle switches once you select your layer. You can use these switches and the available options to set the transparency for the Track Matte. You can add <strong>alpha matte in After Effects</strong> or other types from here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-4.jpg"                      alt="use switches to add track matte"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Performing-Mask-Tracking-With-Adobe-After-Effects-Reviewing-the-Steps"><a href="#Part-2-Performing-Mask-Tracking-With-Adobe-After-Effects-Reviewing-the-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Performing Mask Tracking With Adobe After Effects: Reviewing the Steps"></a>Part 2: Performing Mask Tracking With Adobe After Effects: Reviewing the Steps</h2><p>Another remarkable feature that After Effects offers is mask tracking. Using <strong>After Effects mask tracking</strong>, you can automatically animate a mask’s position, shape, or path. This is done to match the movement of an object in a video clip. You can now easily deal with complex or fast-moving footage with this feature. To use <strong>Track Mask in After Effects</strong>, you can follow these steps:</p><h5 id="Step-1-1"><a href="#Step-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Import the footage you wish to edit in After Effects. Select the clip you wish to track from the timeline. Then, select the “Pen” tool from the top toolbar or press G on your keyboard. Select the area around the object you wish to mask in the footage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-5.jpg"                      alt="use pen tool to mark boundary"                ></p><h5 id="Step-2-1"><a href="#Step-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, open the layer and right-click on the mask name to select “Track Mask.” This will open the mask tracker in the tracker panel at the right. Open the dropdown menu next to the “Method” option. Here, you can find a range of options for tracking methods. Choose the one according to your requirements. If the object isn’t moving much, you can choose a simple option such as “Position.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-6.jpg"                      alt="set method for tracking"                ></p><h5 id="Step-3-1"><a href="#Step-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>Tap the “Analyze Forward” icon and let the tracker analyze the frames in the clip. Once the process has finished, you can restart your clip and set “Mask Mode” from the timeline to “Subtract.” This will remove the selected object from the clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-7.jpg"                      alt="analyze and change mode"                ></p><h5 id="Step-4"><a href="#Step-4" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h5><p>To fill in the details, go to the “Window” menu from the top and select “Content Aware Fill.” Once you see the panel on the screen, set the “Alpha Extension” slider to a number of your choice and click on “Generate Fill Layer.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-8.jpg"                      alt="use content fill properties"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-Masking-Easy-Try-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-Masking-Easy-Try-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make Masking Easy?

It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-1.jpg"                      alt="alpha track matte"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Alpha Matte:</strong> <strong>Alpha matte in After Effects</strong> allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.</li><li><strong>Alpha Inverted Matte:</strong> In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.</li><li><strong>Luma Matte:</strong> A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.</li><li><strong>Luma Inverted Matte:</strong> The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-2.jpg"                      alt="luma track matte"                ></p><p>You can use any of the <strong>track mattes in After Effects</strong> according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:</p><h5 id="Step-1-2"><a href="#Step-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.</p><h5 id="Step-2-2"><a href="#Step-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Go to the “Modes” column and open the dropdown menu next to “Layer List.” Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-3.jpg"                      alt="select track matte layer"                ></p><h5 id="Step-3-2"><a href="#Step-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>You will see two toggle switches once you select your layer. You can use these switches and the available options to set the transparency for the Track Matte. You can add <strong>alpha matte in After Effects</strong> or other types from here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-4.jpg"                      alt="use switches to add track matte"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Performing-Mask-Tracking-With-Adobe-After-Effects-Reviewing-the-Steps-1"><a href="#Part-2-Performing-Mask-Tracking-With-Adobe-After-Effects-Reviewing-the-Steps-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Performing Mask Tracking With Adobe After Effects: Reviewing the Steps"></a>Part 2: Performing Mask Tracking With Adobe After Effects: Reviewing the Steps</h2><p>Another remarkable feature that After Effects offers is mask tracking. Using <strong>After Effects mask tracking</strong>, you can automatically animate a mask’s position, shape, or path. This is done to match the movement of an object in a video clip. You can now easily deal with complex or fast-moving footage with this feature. To use <strong>Track Mask in After Effects</strong>, you can follow these steps:</p><h5 id="Step-1-3"><a href="#Step-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Import the footage you wish to edit in After Effects. Select the clip you wish to track from the timeline. Then, select the “Pen” tool from the top toolbar or press G on your keyboard. Select the area around the object you wish to mask in the footage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-5.jpg"                      alt="use pen tool to mark boundary"                ></p><h5 id="Step-2-3"><a href="#Step-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, open the layer and right-click on the mask name to select “Track Mask.” This will open the mask tracker in the tracker panel at the right. Open the dropdown menu next to the “Method” option. Here, you can find a range of options for tracking methods. Choose the one according to your requirements. If the object isn’t moving much, you can choose a simple option such as “Position.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-6.jpg"                      alt="set method for tracking"                ></p><h5 id="Step-3-3"><a href="#Step-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>Tap the “Analyze Forward” icon and let the tracker analyze the frames in the clip. Once the process has finished, you can restart your clip and set “Mask Mode” from the timeline to “Subtract.” This will remove the selected object from the clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-7.jpg"                      alt="analyze and change mode"                ></p><h5 id="Step-4-1"><a href="#Step-4-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h5><p>To fill in the details, go to the “Window” menu from the top and select “Content Aware Fill.” Once you see the panel on the screen, set the “Alpha Extension” slider to a number of your choice and click on “Generate Fill Layer.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-8.jpg"                      alt="use content fill properties"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-Masking-Easy-Try-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-Masking-Easy-Try-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make Masking Easy?

There are situations when users need to zoom into certain parts of a video, and that is where VLC zoom in video feature comes in handy.</p><p>You may need to zoom into videos to pay attention to details and focus on parts around the subject that others are missing out. For example, you have recorded a video, and you have played it on VLC to zoom in and ensure that there is nothing distracting before you publish the video. Now, we will illustrate all the different ways on how to zoom in VLC Media Player. We will also suggest a better alternative to zoom into videos easily.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Zoom-VLC-Video-Using-Interactive-Zoom"><a href="#Part-1-Zoom-VLC-Video-Using-Interactive-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom"></a>Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom</h2><p>VLC Media Player comes with Interactive Zoom feature that lets you zoom into a section of a video irrespective of its resolution. You can use Interactive Zoom feature to zoom nearly eight times the original size of the video. While you zoom your video with Interactive Zoom option, VLC Media Player zooms the video digitally, and if the video resolution is not high, you can see some deterioration in video quality as you zoom in. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom with Interactive Zoom.</p><p>Step1First, you have to enable Interactive Zoom feature. Launch VLC Player and go to Tools menu option.</p><p>Step2Select Effects and Filters and you will see Adjustments and Effects window open.</p><p>Step3Go to Video Effects tab and then go to Geometry tab.</p><p>Step4Turn on Interactive Zoom option.

However, it is a simple concept for video editors where the encoding settings determine the frequency at which the whole picture is transmitted.</p><p>The <strong>Keyframe Interval</strong> is responsible for how often a keyframe is generated within the video. A keyframe, also known as an i-frame, is a single frame that contains all of the necessary information for displaying a video. If the Keyframe Interval is set too high, it could lead to visible compression without compromising the quality of a video.</p><p><strong>Keyframe Interval</strong> is essential in video streaming and recording, but it can be confusing. In this guide, we’ll help you understand this concept to enable you to create better animations.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Keyframe-Interval"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Keyframe-Interval" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Keyframe Interval"></a>Part 1. What Is Keyframe Interval</h2><p>Keyframe Intervals, also known as “Keyframe Frequency” in Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder (FMLE) and vMix or “GOP size” by some encoders, is the frequency at which keyframes are generated in an animated sequence. This is an important parameter to consider when creating animations, as it can impact the animation’s file size, quality, and smoothness.</p><p>Keyframe Intervals are the distance in time between two keyframes. For example, if an animation is set to every 2 seconds interval and the frame rate is 30 per second, it means that every 60 frames, a keyframe is created.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/keyframe-interval-in-a-video.png"                      alt="keyframe interval in a video"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Keyframe-Interval-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Keyframe-Interval-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The Keyframe Interval is the amount of time that passes between two keyframes.</p><p>In order to create a smooth and consistent transition, the Keyframe Interval must be carefully calculated. In a 60-frame-per-second video, a keyframe is recorded every 5 or 300 frames. Delta frames are “difference” frames that provide an incremental change from the previous frame.</p><p>Keyframes are different from delta frames in that a higher keyframe value results in a clearer video with fewer transmission artifacts and vice versa.</p><p>The Keyframe Interval can be adjusted to create a faster or slower transition between two keyframes. A shorter Keyframe Interval will create a faster transition, while a longer one will create a slower transition.</p><p>For example, if you want your transition to look smoother, use a longer interval, like two seconds. Conversely, a zoom effect over a 0.2-second interval will be quicker.</p><h2 id="Part-3-A-concept-closely-connected-to-Keyframe-Interval-Bitrates"><a href="#Part-3-A-concept-closely-connected-to-Keyframe-Interval-Bitrates" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. A concept closely connected to Keyframe Interval - Bitrates"></a>Part 3. A concept closely connected to Keyframe Interval - Bitrates</h2><p>The relationship between keyframes and bitrates is important to understand when creating video content. Keyframes are the frames in a video that are used to define the start and end points of an encoding process. The bitrate measures how much information is being transferred in a given time from one place to another.</p><p>When encoding video, keyframes are used to establish a consistent quality throughout the video. The bitrate is then used to determine how much information can be transferred without affecting the quality of the video. Thus, the higher the video’s bitrate, the better the quality.</p><p>Your mileage may vary regarding this explanation, as different encoders manage bitrates and keyframes in different ways.</p><p>For example, if you’re using an encoder like Wirecast, you might notice that broadcasting in a still background with someone talking results in a higher quality video as compared to a moving background. This can be reproduced using the same average bitrate and Keyframe Interval between them.</p><p>This happens because the delta frames have to share a lot more information to share in each frame in the video with a moving background. When you have an encoder like Wirecast, it’s working to keep your stream at an average bitrate. This can result in reduced quality if there is a lot of extra information in the <a class="link"   href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/delta-frame#:~:text=In%20interframe%20video%20coding%2C%20a,%2Dframes%20or%20B%2Dframes." >delta frames. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-4-What-You-Need-To-Know-To-Set-A-Right-Keyframe-Interval"><a href="#Part-4-What-You-Need-To-Know-To-Set-A-Right-Keyframe-Interval" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

What You Need To Know To Set A Right Keyframe Interval</h2><p>After understanding the important concepts in video editing, let’s see how to set the keyframe level in our videos appropriately.</p><p>Most streaming services will automatically set it for you based on your stream’s frame rate and bitrate. However, if you want to set the keyframe gap manually, there are a few things you need to keep in mind.</p><ul><li>Set the frame interval at 2 seconds. Do not increase it from 4 seconds.</li><li>Disable the “auto” keyframe feature.</li><li>To allow for b-frames, use an encoding profile higher than baseline and use IDR-based keyframes.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-5-How-To-Change-The-Keyframe-Interval-On-OBS-Studio"><a href="#Part-5-How-To-Change-The-Keyframe-Interval-On-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

In this part, we will choose OBS to show you the application process.</p><p>OBS Studio is a powerful yet free and open-source screen recorder and live streaming tool for Windows, macOS, and Linux. One of the most useful features of OBS Studio is its ability to change the keyframe interval on the fly without having to restart your recording or stream.</p><p>The process for changing the it in OBS Studio has been made more efficient since the classic version. However, some users may have trouble locating the new setting.</p><p>Here’s how to change the it on OBS Studio:</p><p>Step1 Launch the <strong>OBS Studio</strong> on your PC or laptop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/launching-the-obs-studio.png"                      alt="launching the obs studio"                ></p><p>Step2 From the bottom right of the screen, open the <strong>“Settings”</strong> menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/obs-studio-settings-menu.png"                      alt="obs studio settings menu"                ></p><p>Step3 On the Settings Window, click <strong>“Output”</strong> and configure the output mode to <strong>“Advanced.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/setting-the-output-mode-to-advance-in-obs-studio.png"                      alt="setting the output mode to advance in obs studio"                ></p><p>Step4 Finally, edit the <strong>Keyframe Interval,</strong> set it to <strong>2</strong> seconds, and click <strong>“OK”</strong> to save your changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/changing-the-keyframe-interval-value-on-obs-studio.png"                      alt="changing the keyframe interval value on obs studio"                ></p><h2 id="Part-6-Will-Keyframe-Interval-Affect-Your-Video’s-Quality"><a href="#Part-6-Will-Keyframe-Interval-Affect-Your-Video’s-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Part 6.

Will Keyframe Interval Affect Your Video’s Quality?</h2><p>When you try to set the keyframe gap by yourself, you may feel confused about the difference a higher or lower interval make to your video. Then, wil-l or how it affects your video’s performance?</p><p>In a stream, it determines the balance between smoothness and picture quality. A keyframe is a point that determines how often the entire frame is sent, as opposed to just the differences from the previous frame.</p><p>Therefore, if you set the Keyframe Interval higher, your video will be more stable with fewer artifacts but requires more bandwidth and processing power. Conversely, a lower Keyframe Interval value causes more artifacts but is less resource intensive.</p><p>A lower Keyframe Interval value will result in lower video quality, while a higher keyframe value will result in higher video quality. However, the optimal Keyframe Interval value can vary depending on the specific case.</p><p>For instance, you don’t need a higher Keyframe Interval for streaming a live video, but you have to use a higher Key Interval value for recording.</p><p>Video- What is the Maximum Bitrate &amp; Keyframe Interval for OBS</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>In this article, we’ve explored Keyframe Interval, how it works, and the relationship between keyframes and bitrates.

You finally cropped your video using the VLC media player.</p><p>Although there are disadvantages to using this as your cropping tool. Like for example you want the real-time preview of what you’ve changed in your video. This would be a turn off for some that want their outputs to be shown to them immediately. Aside from this, there is a chance that you will forget one step to make and thus, the whole process would need to start over from scratch. Lastly, is the freedom to batch crop multiple videos. This is especially important for those that need to have many clips in one video. A user might lose the continuity of the story within his video.</p><p>While one of its strong suits is the affordability of the software. It is completely free and has no additional charges that may surprise you in the future. Finally, your output won’t have watermarks that could destroy the aesthetics of your video.</p><p>What are your experiences with using it as a cropping tool? What would you recommend to improve it? It is up to you the user if you want to continue using this as your partner in removing the excess in your videos.</p><h2 id="Method-2-Cropping-a-Video-using-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#Method-2-Cropping-a-Video-using-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Cropping a Video using Wondershare Filmora"></a>Method 2: Cropping a Video using Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Have you heard of an editing tool called Wondershare <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ?

You can use Interactive Zoom feature to zoom nearly eight times the original size of the video. While you zoom your video with Interactive Zoom option, VLC Media Player zooms the video digitally, and if the video resolution is not high, you can see some deterioration in video quality as you zoom in. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom with Interactive Zoom.</p><p>Step1First, you have to enable Interactive Zoom feature. Launch VLC Player and go to Tools menu option.</p><p>Step2Select Effects and Filters and you will see Adjustments and Effects window open.</p><p>Step3Go to Video Effects tab and then go to Geometry tab.</p><p>Step4Turn on Interactive Zoom option.

How is it possible? Video transitions are a post-production technique that connects two different shots together. And it makes the whole video goes smooth and fluent.</p><p>Hopping directly from one clip to the next looks pretty queer. It disturbs the whole dynamics and charm of the video. To avoid this, we use video transitions. This makes the video appear much smoother and more linked.</p><p>You may think it is not easy, but after reading this article, you will know how simple it is. All you need is a camera and a few skills. In this article, we will focus on different in-camera transitions and let you know how to edit in a powerful video editor <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Whip-Your-Camera"><a href="#Whip-Your-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Whip Your Camera"></a>Whip Your Camera</h2><p>You may have noticed that when an object moves quickly, the camera creates a blurred image of the object. We call it motion blur. The idea with this transition is to cut and paste your shots together by whipping your camera at the end of your first shot and at the beginning of your second one. This effect depends on two aspects. The first is by the speedy motion of the object out of the frame, and the second is by the camera’s movement.</p><p><strong>Here is a stepwise guide for you to try</strong></p><ol><li>Plan your shots, where and in what direction you will make the whip.</li><li>Then take the first shot and whip the camera at the end of the shot in the direction the object is moving.</li><li>For the next shot, whip the camera into the action and complete the shot.</li><li>Import both shots in your editing tool and find the point of blur in both.</li><li>Cut and paste them to add a blurring effect to your video.</li></ol><p>You can whip your camera in any direction you want. Make sure the movement is fast enough to create a motion blur.</p><p>The result would be a smooth transition from the first shot to the second, as in this clip:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/whip-your-camera.gif"                      alt="whip your camera"                ></p><h2 id="Fill-The-Frame"><a href="#Fill-The-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Fill The Frame"></a>Fill The Frame</h2><p>In this in-camera transition technique, you must fill the frame with an object or subject. Compose the shot with the main subject filling the frame from edge to edge. In this way, those who view the video immediately know what you want them to see.</p><p>Here is step-by-step guidance for this transition</p><ol><li>Plan the two shots you are going to take.</li><li>Find a subject or an action that will fill the frame during recording.</li><li>In the first shot, please make the subject move toward the frame so that it fills the frame.</li><li>The second shot will take place at another time or place.</li><li>To record the second shot, cover the frame with an object and then reveal the shot.</li><li>Import both shots into <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li>Cut the two shots to the point where the frame is filled and paste these shots together.</li></ol><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>One important thing is to match the color and brightness of the object or subject.

Here are the steps to creating a match-cut transition in your videos.</p><ol><li>Plan the shot you are going to take.</li><li>Record the action in the first shot, for example, clapping your hands.</li><li>Go to another place or scene to record the second shot.</li><li>Repeat the same action in the second shot.</li><li>Import both camera shots to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li>Cut one shot to another when the action is at its peak.</li></ol><p>This way, you can smoothly transition from one place or scene to another.

You could create a simple story or a complex one.</li><li>Since your computer might struggle to process numerous 4k videos, it would help to create proxy files as early as possible so you can save your progress along the way.</li><li>During filming, create and collect your favorite b-roll shots. These clips provide extra information or context to anyone watching your music video.</li><li>Ensure you match the video to the beat and look out for areas where the performer sings along. We guarantee your fans will notice the slightest delay between the song and the performer in the video.</li><li>Once the music video looks polished and synchronized, you can adjust brightness, contrast, and exposure and change the white balance.</li><li>Lastly, you could begin or end the video with the artists’ credits, such as their names or logo. Since it is a relevant piece of information, ensure this segment of the video grabs the viewers’ attention.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If you want your song to go viral, you ought to put in the work and make the video as good as the soundtrack.

Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We’ll demonstrate how to do easily for you.</p><p>Let’s start off!</p><h2 id="1-Importing-your-footage"><a href="#1-Importing-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="1. Importing your footage"></a>1. Importing your footage</h2><p>After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the “Image Utilities” heading.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-green-screen-video-footage-ae.jpg"                      alt="import green screen video footage ae"                ></p><h2 id="2-Remove-the-green-color"><a href="#2-Remove-the-green-color" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove the green color"></a>2. Remove the green color</h2><p>After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the “Animation Presets” window, searching for the “Keylight” preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the “Effects Controls” window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen’s background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/remove-green-color-from-video-in-ae.jpg"                      alt="remove green color from video in ae"                ></p><h2 id="3-Clean-up-the-shot"><a href="#3-Clean-up-the-shot" class="headerlink" title="3. Clean up the shot"></a>3. Clean up the shot</h2><p>You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.</p><p>Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg"                      alt="clean up green screen shot ae"                ></p><p>You can go to the “Screen Matte” area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you’ve applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="How-to-Make-Glitch-Effect-with-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Make-Glitch-Effect-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Glitch Effect with Filmora"></a>How to Make Glitch Effect with Filmora</h2><p>You don’t need outdated VCRs or any other broken technology to produce glitch effects.

Nowadays, retro video effects are very popular in TV movies and even games. You can use these effects in many ways, like making fake vintage footage or emulating a glitching computer.</p><p>Filmmakers frequently employ glitching in their videos to give the impression that a character has been affected by a technical abnormality, is having a flashback, or is being watched by someone else via a digital camera system.

They tweak the colors and tones in your footage to create a new visual experience. Following are the basic details of using and applying LUTs in basic video editing operations.</p><p><strong>Types of LUTs</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Technical LUTs:</strong> These are for technical stuff like adjusting color spaces or correcting gamma. They ensure your colors and tones stay consistent across different devices and platforms.</li><li><strong>Creative LUTs:</strong> This type is a fun type of LUT. Creative LUTs help you achieve specific looks or styles. They can make your videos look like they were shot on film or create different moods and visual effects.</li></ul><p><strong>Apply LUTs with the Correct LUT Format</strong></p><p>You can apply LUTs using different video editing software. For instance, there is Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro, and others to apply LUT. Just load the LUT and apply it to your video clips or the whole project. Moreover, you can make adjustments to the LUT according to your preference.</p><p>In addition, LUTs come in different file formats, such as .cube, .3dl, .look, or .icc. The most common one is .cube. Furthermore, different video editing tools support different formats. Moreover, choose the right format for your editing software and the colors you want.</p><p><strong>Customizing LUTs and Non-Destructive Editing</strong></p><p>You don’t have to stick with pre-made LUTs. Additionally, you can create your own or modify existing ones to match your needs and style. Advanced color grading software lets you tweak individual colors, contrast, saturation, and more. Save these adjustments as custom LUTs for future use.</p><p>The great thing about LUTs is that they don’t mess with your original video file.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Omnicharge Omni 20+ is a special sort of power bankthat tries to be all things for all people. With a decent 71Wh capacity and a wide variety of ways to input and output power, including USB-C and a wireless Qi charger, it comes pretty close.</p><p> Always on the lookout for ways to simplify my road kit, I recently slipped an Omni 20+ into my messenger bag to see how well it can stand-in for the assortment of chargers I normally pack. Through about a week of use and testing, I was able to get a pretty good feel for how well the Omni 20+ performs, how well it charges a variety of devices, and whether or not it’s worth the fairly stiff asking price.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/lFGiT6009F_OKGOJ-sLcNKNylt0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Omni-portable-power-bank-2-9a3217b3ee154a3ebcb38e61aac3be52.jpg"                      alt="Omnicharge Omni 20 Portable Power Bank"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Design-Slick-all-black-appearance-that’s-dulled-a-bit-by-soft-touch-rubber"><a href="#Design-Slick-all-black-appearance-that’s-dulled-a-bit-by-soft-touch-rubber" class="headerlink" title="Design: Slick all-black appearance that’s dulled a bit by soft-touch rubber"></a><strong>Design: Slick all-black appearance that’s dulled a bit by soft-touch rubber</strong></h2><p> The Omni 20+ is a great looking device, with an all-black case and gem-cut edges that fit in nicely when used alongside my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hp-spectre-x360-15t-touch-laptop-review-4773540" >HP Spectre x360 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The top and bottom are completely bereft of any markings, hiding the presence of a Qi wireless charger hidden in the top, and the labels that it does have for inputs and outputs are understated.</p><p> The power inputs and outputs are all located on the front and sides of the device, which minimizes cord clutter a bit. I prefer power bricks that allow you to plug everything into one side, but the Omni 20+ is set up more cleanly than some I’ve used.</p><p> My one real issue with the design is the choice to use soft-touch rubber. It looks nice now, and it feels nice, and I suppose it helps absorb some shock when packed away for travel, but this is a material that just isn’t made to go the distance. Soft-touch rubber tends to degrade and get sticky over time, attracting all manner of lint and dust, and also becoming quite unpleasant to touch.</p><p> The USB-C port is capable of fast charging some devices and providing up to 60W of power.</p><p> For a premium device with a premium price like the Omni 20+, I’d like to see a different material used for the case.</p><h2 id="Initial-Setup-Frustrating-due-to-a-lack-of-documentation"><a href="#Initial-Setup-Frustrating-due-to-a-lack-of-documentation" class="headerlink" title="Initial Setup: Frustrating due to a lack of documentation"></a><strong>Initial Setup: Frustrating due to a lack of documentation</strong></h2><p> While it’s clear that a lot of thought and care went into designing the Omni 20+, it’s just as clear that almost no thought was given over to the packaging and documentation. When you open the box, you’re greeted with the battery itself, a USB-A to C cable, a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/usb-c-4149490" >USB-C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to C cable, and a couple of brochures. One of those brochures is marked as a quick start guide, but it really isn’t.</p><p> The two things lacking in this presentation are a charging cable and an actual instruction manual, the latter of which ends up being a huge problem due to the confusing nature of the display and controls.</p><p> When you look at the Omni 20+, you can see that the barrel jack and USB-C plug are both marked IN&#x2F;OUT, indicating that you can use these ports to charge the battery or to charge other devices.</p><p> I tried using the included USB-A to C cable to plug the Omni 20+ into the BESTEK power strip tower I keep on my desk, but it didn’t work. There was some kind of miscommunication somewhere between the circuitry in the power strip USB ports and the Omni 20+ that caused the charging process to start and stop over and over at very short intervals.</p><p> The next thing I tried was the USB-Charger that came with my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/nintendo-switch-review-4707563" >Nintendo Switch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and that worked just fine. According to the documentation that’s available from the Omnicharge website, but not in the box, you can use a USB-C charger up to 45W, or you can use a 5.5x82.1mm barrel plug that falls anywhere in the 4.5 - 36V range.</p><p> Once you’ve fully charged the Omni 20+, you need to discharge and then charge it again to completely calibrate the battery. The USB-C port is plug and play, meaning you can plug any USB-C device in and power it up without changing any settings, but you do have to use the somewhat confusing LCD display if you want to charge using the power outlet, barrel connector, or the USB-A ports. None of this is terribly complicated, but I did need to download an instructions PDF from the official Omnicharge site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/QOfV3Sc5THi3Z0gKZq0e-ciPUEE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Omni-portable-power-bank-5-000854ae3c4347b7adc13130dcb9d1b9.jpg"                      alt="Omnicharge Omni 20 Portable Power Bank"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Display-Crisp-and-easy-to-read-but-confusing"><a href="#Display-Crisp-and-easy-to-read-but-confusing" class="headerlink" title="Display: Crisp and easy to read, but confusing"></a><strong>Display: Crisp and easy to read, but confusing</strong></h2><p> The display is small, but it’s quite bright and easy to read. The only issue is that it isn’t particularly easy to figure out what the individual icons mean, or how to use the display to change input and output settings, without referring to an instruction manual that isn’t included in the box.</p><p> I’ve already covered the issue with the manual in the previous section, so suffice it to say I recommend avoiding frustration and just downloading the manual from the Omnicharge website rather than trying to figure out the display and controls on your own.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139109/17108" target="_top" id="2139109">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139109" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139109/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Sockets-and-Ports-Excellent-array-including-wireless"><a href="#Sockets-and-Ports-Excellent-array-including-wireless" class="headerlink" title="Sockets and Ports: Excellent array, including wireless"></a><strong>Sockets and Ports: Excellent array, including wireless</strong></h2><p> The Omni 20+ includes a nice array of sockets and ports, managing to cover all of the important bases with ease. On one side, you’ll find a USB-C port and a barrel connector port, which are both capable of charging the Omni 20+ or providing power to other devices.</p><p> The USB-C port is capable of<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-fast-chargers-4774501" >fast charging <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> some devices and providing up to 60W of power. This isn’t universal, but it worked for my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-pixel-3-review-4589365" >Pixel 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and the other devices I had on hand for testing.</p><p> The barrel port can be used to power up your laptop and other devices that normally require an external power adapter. To accomplish that, however, you’ll need a 5.5 x 2.1mm barrel plug and an adapter tip designed for your device.</p><p> I did have a barrel connector and adapter tip on hand to charge my HP Spectre x360 on the road, and appreciated the fact that I was able to leave the power adapter at home. For a power bank in this price range, though, I’d expect the necessary hardware to be included in the box.</p><p> While this power bank isn’t going to keep all of your devices fed all day, the most important thing is that it features pass-through charging.</p><p> If you don’t mind packing extra adapters, or you have a device that won’t accept a fast charge over the included USB-C port, then the Omni 20+ does include a perfectly functional AC outlet on the other side. This is a nice touch for the sake of compatibility, but I see a power bank like the Omni 20+ as a way to reduce clutter, so I look at the power outlet as more of a useful backup than something I want to use every day.</p><p> On the front of the power bank, next to the display, you’ll find two USB-A ports. These ports are capable of charging all your standard USB devices. One is a Qualcomm 3.0 compatible quick charge port, and the other is a standard USB port that’s capable of putting out up to 3A.</p><h2 id="Battery-Decent-battery-capacity-for-the-size"><a href="#Battery-Decent-battery-capacity-for-the-size" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Decent battery capacity for the size"></a><strong>Battery: Decent battery capacity for the size</strong></h2><p> The Omni 20+ includes a 20,000 mAh battery, which is a decent capacity for the size of this power bank. I’d like to see a larger capacity based on the price of this unit, but it’s clear that you’re paying for extra features like fast USB-Charging and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/qi-wireless-charging-4151894" >wireless charging <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead of a big battery.</p><p> In practice, I found that the Omni 20+ wasn’t able to fully charge my HP Spectre x360, although the beefy battery and 17-hour runtime on that laptop means that I was still able to get a considerable boost from this power bank. When charging my Pixel 3, I found that I was able to get four charges out of the Omni 20+ with a little juice left over.</p><p> While this power bank isn’t going to keep all of your devices fed all day, the most important thing is that it features pass-through charging. That means you can charge the Omni 20+ while it charges or powers your devices, allowing it to function as a universal power adapter in addition to a power bank.</p><p> By plugging the Omni 20+ into power when available, I found it to be a fantastic replacement for an otherwise bulky assortment of power adapters for my laptop, phone, and other devices.</p><p> When charged over USB-C using an appropriate charger, like my Nintendo Switch charger, the Omni 20+ takes about three hours to charge to full. Charging it with a weaker charger, or over the barrel connector, takes a bit longer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/aZDfINCcUg9uIHRuhVr2k3wmX94=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Omni-portable-power-bank-1-815fe3c777eb4f46a77cb00127bd88c2.jpg"                      alt="Omnicharge Omni 20 Portable Power Bank"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137976/21526" target="_top" id="2137976">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137976" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137976/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><h2 id="Charging-Speed-True-fast-charging-available-for-some-USB-C-devices"><a href="#Charging-Speed-True-fast-charging-available-for-some-USB-C-devices" class="headerlink" title="Charging Speed: True fast charging available for some USB-C devices"></a><strong>Charging Speed: True fast charging available for some USB-C devices</strong></h2><p> For the most part, the Omni 20+ is able to charge each device as fast as it’s designed to be charged. Older devices that charge over standard USB-A ports will draw between 1 and 3 A, depending on the device, and charge quite slowly. But if you have a Qualcomm 3.0 compatible device, you can plug it into the appropriate USB port and enjoy faster charging.</p><p> My Pixel 3 drew 1.46A when plugged into the USB-A ports, regardless of which port I chose. Other devices drew between 0.37 and 1.46A.</p><p> When plugged into the USB-C port with the included USB-C cable, I found that my Pixel 3 charged just as quickly as if I were using the factory charger. It drew 11 watts of power when plugged in via USB-C and entered its “charging rapidly” mode. I also plugged the factory charger into the included power outlet, and noticed no difference in speed.</p><p> I was also able to charge other USB-C devices, like my Nintendo Switch, with no problems.</p><p> By plugging the Omni 20+ into power when available, I found it to be a fantastic replacement for an otherwise bulky assortment of power adapters for my laptop, phone, and other devices.</p><p> The built-in Qi charger is capable of putting out 10 watts, and I found it to work just as well as other 10 watt Qi chargers I’ve used. It is a bit touchy in terms of positioning, but I was able to get the hang of it pretty fast.</p><h2 id="Price-High-end"><a href="#Price-High-end" class="headerlink" title="Price: High end"></a><strong>Price: High end</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $200, Omni 20+ is a high-end battery bank with a high-end price. You get a whole lot of functionality for that price, but the device does lag behind in terms of both battery capacity and included accessories. The glaring issue is that you can find more powerful battery banks for less money, even if you won’t find one with the exact same functionality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135395/19272" target="_top" id="2135395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135395/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Omni-20-vs-Pilot-Pro-2"><a href="#Omni-20-vs-Pilot-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="Omni 20+ vs. Pilot Pro 2"></a><strong>Omni 20+ vs. Pilot Pro 2</strong></h2><p> With an MSRP of $90, you could buy two<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/poweradd-pilot-pro2-review-4843548" >Pilot Pro 2 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> battery packs for the price of a single Omni 20+. With that disparity in price, it would seem like these devices aren’t even in the same category, but they actually have some important similarities. In fact, the 23,000 mAh battery in the Pilot Pro 2 is even a bit more powerful than the Omni 20+.</p><p> The most onerous difference between these two devices is that the Pilot Pro 2 comes with a barrel connector and a nice set of adapter tips. With an MSRP almost double that of the Pilot Pro 2, it’s a bit galling that the Omni 20+ doesn’t even come with a power adapter, let alone the hardware necessary to charge your laptop.</p><p> The Omni 20+ does come out ahead in a lot of areas. It includes wireless charging, which the Pilot Pro 2 lacks. It also offers both Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 fast charging over USB-A and high wattage fast charging over USB-C, and comes with a power outlet, all of which are features that the Pilot Pro 2 lacks.</p><p> The Omni 20+ is clearly the more fully-featured of these two battery banks, so why does the much cheaper Pilot Pro 2 come with a nice assortment of accessories that Omnicharge leaves you to find on your own? The Omni 20+ is clearly the better power bank, but this kind of price tag demands a less spartan box.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>Fantastic functionality, decent battery capacity, and frustrating setup experience.</strong></p><p> The Omnicharge Omni 20+ is one of the best power banks out there, and it had better be for the price they’re asking. This is the power bank you need if you count a high wattage USB-C port, barrel connector input and output, wireless charging, and a standard power outlet among your needs. You can find cheaper power banks that provide more juice, but you won’t find one with this same feature set.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130530/26400" target="_top" id="2130530">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130530" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130530/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  20+ Wireless Power Bank</li><li>Product Brand  Omni</li><li>Price  $200.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  5 x 4.8 x 1.1 in.</li><li>Color  Black</li><li>Capacity  18650mAh Li-ion</li><li>Output  100W (outlet), 60W (USB-C), 10W (wireless)</li><li>Warranty  One year</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-innovative-techniques-improve-your-hp-laptop-screen-recordings/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Innovative Techniques Improve Your HP Laptop Screen Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/fixing-performance-lags-and-stutter-in-modern-warfare-2-on-windows-systems/"><u>Fixing Performance Lags & Stutter in Modern Warfare 2 on Windows Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-error-495-while-downloadupdating-android-apps-on-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix Error 495 While Download/Updating Android Apps On Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-getting-the-pokemon-go-gps-signal-not-found-11-error-in-vivo-v30-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, Getting the Pokemon Go GPS Signal Not Found 11 Error in Vivo V30 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-life360-learn-how-everything-works-on-oneplus-ace-2-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Life360 Learn How Everything Works On OnePlus Ace 2 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/tech-bargains-on-prime-shopping-event-secure-your-devices-with-premium-surge-protectors/"><u>Tech Bargains on Prime Shopping Event: Secure Your Devices with Premium Surge Protectors!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/unlock-more-fun-on-your-nes-classic-with-essential-game-installation-techniques/"><u>Unlock More Fun on Your NES Classic with Essential Game Installation Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/vyncs-link-analysis-unrivaled-monitoring-capabilities-overshadowed-by-puzzling-pricing-structures/"><u>Vyncs Link Analysis: Unrivaled Monitoring Capabilities Overshadowed by Puzzling Pricing Structures</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Or do you want to learn to be more professional in your creativity? Don’t worry. We got you.</p><p>Here you will learn how to take your videos to the next level using speed ramping with a professional video editor- Wondershare Filmora. Moreover, you will get to know two ways to add the effect.</p><ol><li>Using speed ramping effect and glitch effects.</li><li>Using the standard speed settings.</li></ol><p>These effects can work well for any action sports or dance video. Let’s check out about speed ramping effect and ways to add it.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-speed-ramping"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-speed-ramping" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is speed ramping?"></a>Part 1. What is speed ramping?</h2><p>You’ve probably seen speed ramping used in suspenseful moments of a basketball video before, like a ball bouncing on the rim or a long buzzer-beating shot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-1.gif"                      alt="cinematic shots of a basketball player"                ></p><p>With speed ramping, we can slow down our most exciting moments to show our audience. And then speed it up again to keep pace with the music or action. So it will give you a smooth transition effect.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-enhance-action-videos-with-the-speed-ramping-effect"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-enhance-action-videos-with-the-speed-ramping-effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

For our example footage, we want to ensure we have set our camera to a higher frame rate for filming this type of video since we’re going to use slow motion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-2.jpg"                      alt="shot footage from a higher angels"                ></p><p><strong>How to capture the best footage?</strong></p><p>You can shoot handheld with a camera or a mobile phone because it allows you to move around your talent and catch some movements and action while giving a shaky camera effect for added suspense. To make evenly balanced videos, you can use a gimbal stabilizer. Here are some tips to get better shots.</p><ul><li>Change camera angles. Try getting shots low to the ground as well as at higher angles. That will give you more options to cut between when you edit the video.</li><li>Get various shots. You can get shots of dribbling, shooting, and just running with the ball to work with.</li><li>Try shooting on a longer lens. It is because you may not be able to get close to the action.</li><li>Record footage in slow mode on your camera or phone. It will allow you to capture more frames: the more frames, the smoother the slow-motion effect.</li></ul><p>Best capturing will make your video more cinematic and visually pleasing after preparing the footage. Finally, we will dive into edit tutorials on speed ramping and glitch effects separately for better understanding.</p><h5 id="Step2-Edit-the-speed-of-footage-in-Filmora"><a href="#Step2-Edit-the-speed-of-footage-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Edit the speed of footage in Filmora"></a>Step2 Edit the speed of footage in Filmora</h5><p>There are two ways to achieve the speed ramping effect. One is to use the speed ramping feature to adjust the video speed—the other way to achieve a similar effect is by using the standard speed settings.</p><p><strong>Edit with speed ramping feature in Filmora</strong></p><p>The speed ramping feature is included in Filmora standard license. So let’s start by opening Filmora.</p><p>1. Import media</p><p>First, import a video from your media library in the Wondershare Filmora. And drag the clip down on the timeline to start editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-3.jpg"                      alt="library in wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>2. Apply the speed ramping feature</p><p>To apply the speed ramping feature, <strong>right-click</strong> on the clip on the timeline. And click speed in the menu and choose <strong>speed ramping</strong> to open the settings window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-4.jpg"                      alt="add speed ramping option"                ></p><p>You can choose different speed templates in the setting window. Or, on the left corner, click on the customize option to adjust the keyframes and create the speed you want for the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-5.jpg"                      alt="speed templates on wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>The lower keyframe is when the video is slowest, and the peak is when the video is fastest. The middle parts between the keyframes are when it speeds up or slows down to reach the specific speed you set on each keyframe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-6.gif"                      alt="adjusting key-frames wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>Grab the keyframes and move them up to increase the speed or down to slow down the rate. You can also add more keyframes by moving the playhead to the spot where you want to change speed and clicking the plus button.</p><p>After adjusting our keyframes, we can play it back to see if we like the result.</p><p><strong>Edit with standard speed settings in Filmora</strong></p><p>Since speed ramping can only be used for paid users, we also provide you with an alternative way to give an exact transition effect, like speed ramping. Check out the following steps to add it.</p><p>1. You can <strong>drag</strong> the video from your library to the timeline. While in the <strong>timeline</strong>, double-click to open the speed menu. Then choose the starting speed you want your video to be with the speed slider.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-7.jpg"                      alt="uniform speed"                ></p><p>2. Next, move your playhead to the <strong>point of the video</strong> you want to slow down the speed. Here we will cut and then double-click that clip to open the speed menu again. Change the pace with the speed slider again</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-8.gif"                      alt="split adjusting the clips"                ></p><p>Following the above steps, a speed ramping style effect can be created without using the premium feature. Stealthy, isn’t it?</p><h5 id="Step3-Add-some-intensity-to-shots-with-the-BCC-glitch-effect"><a href="#Step3-Add-some-intensity-to-shots-with-the-BCC-glitch-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add some intensity to shots with the BCC glitch effect"></a>Step3 Add some intensity to shots with the BCC glitch effect</h5><p>We will use Boris FX BCC glitch to add some intensity to our video. It is a plug-in built-in Filmora and gives a feeling of chaos to match the action in the video. To apply the BCC glitch effect to the video.</p><ul><li>Click on the effects options in the top bar. For example, a window on the left side showing you the option Boris FX will have a sub-option BCC stylize. Click on it.</li><li>Drag the effect above the place you want it in the timeline.</li><li>Double-click the effect to open its settings.</li><li>A drop-down menu at the top of the screen has tons of glitch presets to try out.</li><li>We are going to scroll down and select shake with motion blur. This preset will use the exact look we want for our basketball video to make the speed ramping more intense.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-9.gif"                      alt="present a drop-down menu and reduce the effect"                ></p><ul><li>You can change the settings around after choosing a preset. For example, let’s turn up the glitch intensity to have our glitch a little more extreme. Moving further, we can change the glitch duration to our specific needs.</li></ul><p>Now we can watch our video to see our glitch with the motion blur effect. Isn’t it crazy to make a cinematic video by yourself? The speed ramping feature and glitch effects can bring any sports video to the next level.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h5 id="Step1-Shot-the-footage-1"><a href="#Step1-Shot-the-footage-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Shot the footage"></a>Step1 Shot the footage</h5><p>To edit a montage, you must first capture it correctly.

To get this done, you first need to check if your smartphone has an HDR mode and if it does, how to use the same.</p><p>So, we are here to help you to learn in detail about HDR Android photography and how to use the HDR mode on your smartphone. Keep reading till the read and we assure you that you will be able to capture some breath-taking images with your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hdr-photography-how-to-use-hdr-mode-on-your-android-devices-7.jpg"                      alt="hdr mode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-HDR-photography"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-HDR-photography" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is HDR photography?"></a>Part 1: What is HDR photography?</h2><p>First things first. Before using the HDR feature on your smartphone, let’s learn what actually is the function of HDR.</p><p>Standing for High Dynamic Range, HDR is an image capturing method where the dynamic range of an image is high. When we talk about dynamic range, it refers to the difference between the lightest and the darkest elements of a picture. Thus, in HDR images the range dynamic range of the image is greater than the actual capture and thus making the image look more real with higher contrast, colors, and saturation.</p><p>While using the HDR image capturing method, the subject is captured in multiple shots having different exposures. These multiple captured shots are then combined into a single picture thus making it look detailed and saturated.</p><p>Though HDR enhances the overall looks of an image it is not suitable only in certain situations and subjects like landscape, subjects captured in sunlight or bright background, low or dim light conditions, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hdr-photography-how-to-use-hdr-mode-on-your-android-devices-4.jpg"                      alt="hdr mode vs non hdr"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-tell-if-I-can-shoot-HDR-images-on-my-Android-devices-or-not"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-tell-if-I-can-shoot-HDR-images-on-my-Android-devices-or-not" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to tell if I can shoot HDR images on my Android devices or not?"></a>Part 2: How to tell if I can shoot HDR images on my Android devices or not?</h2><p>HDR images can be captured using DSLR cameras, but you need to have a thorough knowledge of the camera and the process of capturing the HDR images. A simpler alternative to this is using an Android device. The principle of capturing HDR images using an Android phone is simpler in comparison to a professional DSLR camera and also quick. Using an Android device, the imbalance in the exposure is corrected and the details of the image background, as well as the foreground, are enhanced.</p><p><strong>How-to steps to check the HDR camera Android feature</strong></p><p>So now that you know that HDR images can be easily captured using your Android device, the next important thing is to check if your phone supports the HDR feature or not as not all Android devices have the HDR mode. Below listed are some of the options where you can the HDR option in the camera app of your Android device.</p><ul><li>Check for the HDR option under the Shooting Mode menu (this can be found on high-end Samsung phones.)</li><li>In the devices like HTC One X, Desire X, and others with custom Camera apps, the feature can be found under the Camera Scenes section.</li><li>In case you cannot locate the HDR option in both the above methods then try looking for it under the Settings menu of Camera. Devices like Sony Xperia T and Xperia V have the option here.</li><li>For the Nexus 4 device that runs on Android 4.2 OS, the option of HDR mode can be turned on by simply long-tapping the viewfinder and then tapping on the HDR icon.</li><li>You may also find the option of HDR mode under the labels like Backlight HDR or Backlight Correction HDR. On the Samsung Galaxy devices, HDR is labeled as Rich Tone and can be located under the Smart Modes menu.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Take-an-HDR-Shot-with-Your-Android-devices"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Take-an-HDR-Shot-with-Your-Android-devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Take an HDR Shot with Your Android devices?"></a>Part 3: How to Take an HDR Shot with Your Android devices?</h2><p>Once you have found the HDR mode on your Android device, using the feature is simple.</p><p>Below listed are the steps to take HDR shots on your Android phone.</p><p>Step1 First of all, open the camera app on your phone and find the option of HDR.</p><p>Step2 Enable the HDR option on your device.</p><p>Step3 Once the feature is enabled, you simply need to capture images like you would normally do- point and focus on the image subject and click the image.</p><p>The rest will be taken care and your <strong>HDR shot</strong> image will be captured.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> ensure to hold your phone with stable hands while capturing the image or you can even use a tripod.

The colors do not appear bright and robust on a screen as in real life.</p><p>While there are numerous reasons for the dull, uninviting look- a basic edit could fix it quickly. One of the vital, if not the first, steps in the process is color grading and color correction. However, what exactly are color grading and color correction? And how can they help fix the color ratios and balance in a video?</p><p>This article covers everything you need to know about color grading and correction and a complete guide to adjusting cinematic colors with the best video editor, Wondershare Filmora. So, without much ado, let’s dig into it!</p><h2 id="Part-1-Color-Grading-VS-Color-Correction"><a href="#Part-1-Color-Grading-VS-Color-Correction" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Color Grading VS Color Correction"></a>Part 1. Color Grading VS Color Correction</h2><p>These terms have often been used interchangeably; people consider them synonymous. However, they are two different artistic phenomena to adjust the color scheme.</p><p>Since we will discuss them in detail later, here is a brief description. Put simply, color correcting is a corrective procedure, while color grading is a cinematic adjustment.</p><p>Color correction diverts the colors to a relatively neutral baseline achieving a unified look for all captured shots. On the other hand, color grading is inclined more toward a creative look aimed at balancing colors that reflect the emotion of the sequence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/color-correction-vs-color-grading.gif"                      alt="color correction vs color grading"                ></p><p>These two work hand in hand to dramatically uplift the overall look of the sequence.

What Is Color Correction?"></a>Part 2. What Is Color Correction?</h2><p>We will start with color correction- the first step in color editing. Even with a slight glance at the raw shots, you can notice how much the tones are messed up. The crude product is oversaturated with colors.</p><p>Color correction is about making the shots look as natural as possible. It brings the sequences to the neutral baseline to achieve a unified look.</p><p>For now, we need to ignore our creative and aesthetic preferences and focus entirely on exposure and white balance. The actual end goal is to keep the colors true to life.</p><p>However, color-correcting a video is challenging if you are a beginner. There needs to be more than just understanding the fundamentals; it requires cinematic and technical skills.</p><p>Here is the basic process for a clean, color-corrected shot, irrespective of the software you use.</p><h3 id="Essential-Steps-for-Color-Correcting-a-Shot"><a href="#Essential-Steps-for-Color-Correcting-a-Shot" class="headerlink" title="Essential Steps for Color Correcting a Shot"></a>Essential Steps for Color Correcting a Shot</h3><h5 id="1-Set-the-color-profile"><a href="#1-Set-the-color-profile" class="headerlink" title="1. Set the color profile"></a>1. Set the color profile</h5><p>Different video formats (HDR, LOG, RAW, HLG, etc.) have different exposure content. Therefore, select a color profile that matches your video format for the best results before starting.</p><h5 id="2-Adjust-the-saturation"><a href="#2-Adjust-the-saturation" class="headerlink" title="2. Adjust the saturation"></a>2. Adjust the saturation</h5><p>It is the primary step of color correction. Often the exposure of raw content is high. Next, equalize the saturation for a natural look.</p><h5 id="3-Fix-the-contrast"><a href="#3-Fix-the-contrast" class="headerlink" title="3. Fix the contrast"></a>3. Fix the contrast</h5><p>Contrast is the difference between the light and dark areas of the image. Pictures with a higher contrast are sharper and more detailed.</p><p>However, adjust the contrast during color correcting so that the dark areas are not crushed, and you preserve the details maximally.</p><h5 id="4-Set-the-white-balance"><a href="#4-Set-the-white-balance" class="headerlink" title="4. Set the white balance"></a>4. Set the white balance</h5><p>It is time to adjust the white balance with the saturation and contrast fixed. The colors will shift to orange and blue hues if it is maladjusted.</p><p>Use the color curves to ensure pure whites so all colors fall correctly in place.</p><h5 id="5-Double-check-individual-color-tones"><a href="#5-Double-check-individual-color-tones" class="headerlink" title="5. Double-check individual color tones"></a>5. Double-check individual color tones</h5><p>The final step is a secondary checking of the individual colors. Double-check the skin tones so they match in each shot.</p><p>Make sure the skin tones match their natural hues for an authentic, unfiltered look.</p><p>It is a basic walkthrough for color-correcting. More steps can vary according to the professional demands of the video. However, as a beginner, this is the best process to follow.</p><p>Once we’ve corrected the color, it is time to move to the next and primary step- color grading.</p><p><strong>ChatGPT is Now Available in Filmora！</strong> Filmora now offers a ChatGPT plug-in to provide a more inspirational copywriting experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Is-Color-Grading"><a href="#Part-3-What-Is-Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What Is Color Grading?"></a>Part 3. What Is Color Grading?</h2><p>After you set all the tones to the baseline, you can start with the creative process of color grading. In this case, you do not change the colors anymore. Instead, you make artistic choices to change the moods and emotions of that particular sequence. Color grading is about manipulating the colors and contrasts that intensify the visual tone and explain your story to the world.</p><p>Color correction can be enough if you want to keep the video realistic. However, color grading is essential if you want to imply emotions and feelings in your content. Following is an essential step-by-step guide to color grading.</p><h3 id="Basic-Steps-of-Color-Grading"><a href="#Basic-Steps-of-Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="Basic Steps of Color Grading"></a>Basic Steps of Color Grading</h3><p>If you are a beginner, the color grading process can be tricky without expertise. Hence here are the basic steps of color grading a video.</p><h5 id="1-Color-correcting"><a href="#1-Color-correcting" class="headerlink" title="1. Color correcting"></a>1. Color correcting</h5><p>Correcting the colors and balance will always be the first step before you can color-grade footage. Next, the video must be normalized and should seem natural before you intensify the overall look.</p><h5 id="2-Match-the-colors"><a href="#2-Match-the-colors" class="headerlink" title="2. Match the colors"></a>2. Match the colors</h5><p>In the next step, we balance the contours between color-corrected footage and color grading. Then, you can use LUTs (Look Up Tables) to match the individual colors to the scheme.</p><h5 id="3-Shot-to-shot-matching"><a href="#3-Shot-to-shot-matching" class="headerlink" title="3. Shot-to-shot matching"></a>3. Shot-to-shot matching</h5><p>The next integral step is to match the colors between all the shots so we can achieve a unified look. The contrasting appearance of shots can make them look unprofessional and poorly cinematic.</p><h5 id="4-Adjust-the-mood-and-emotions"><a href="#4-Adjust-the-mood-and-emotions" class="headerlink" title="4. Adjust the mood and emotions"></a>4. Adjust the mood and emotions</h5><p>A well-executed color grading can potentiate the emotions in a shot.

Make the final adjustments"></a>5. Make the final adjustments</h5><p>As the final opportunity, tweak hues and chroma to ensure the colors match your palette in each scene. But, again, do not overdo anything, and play with colors to nudge the moods in the shot.</p><p>If your footage is the cake, color grading is the cherry on top that enhances the final look. You can instantly evoke connotations and bring the audience to a different page with some professional color grading.</p><p>However, while color correcting and grading, there are a few things that you should take care of. Here is a list of some To-do’s and Not To-do’s in the post-production edit.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Things-To-Consider-About-the-Editing-Environment"><a href="#Part-4-Things-To-Consider-About-the-Editing-Environment" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Things To Consider About the Editing Environment"></a>Part 4. Things To Consider About the Editing Environment</h2><p>Before you begin color-grading or color-correcting, here are some essential things to consider that can dramatically improve the results.</p><h5 id="1-Neutral-editing-environment"><a href="#1-Neutral-editing-environment" class="headerlink" title="1. Neutral editing environment"></a>1. Neutral editing environment</h5><p>Funky neon lights or fluorescent lights in the background can dominate your vision. As compensation, you will be over-saturating your footage with colors.</p><p>Make sure to use only white, neutral light with a CRI (color rendering Index) of at least 90. It will decrease inconsistencies as much as possible.</p><h5 id="2-Using-might-shifts-orange-screen"><a href="#2-Using-might-shifts-orange-screen" class="headerlink" title="2. Using might shifts&#x2F;orange screen"></a>2. Using might shifts&#x2F;orange screen</h5><p>People often activate night shifts or orange screens to protect their eyes from excessive strain. Resultantly, the screen appears dull and orange-y.</p><p>Since this alters the actual colors of the video, the results are undermined. So make sure to turn off all technologies that can sabotage the grading.</p><h5 id="3-Control-the-light"><a href="#3-Control-the-light" class="headerlink" title="3. Control the light"></a>3. Control the light</h5><p>It is necessary to control the amount of light that enters your working space area. Excessive light alters your color perception and hence obstructs achieving a balanced contour.</p><p>Ensure that the light does not directly falls on the screen or your eyes. You must maintain an adequate distance from the screen to see nuances as you grade.</p><p>After completing all the fundamentals of color correcting and color grading, let’s demonstrate how to do it in real-time.</p><p>Choosing good software can be chaos.

What Is Color Grading?"></a>Part 3. What Is Color Grading?</h2><p>After you set all the tones to the baseline, you can start with the creative process of color grading. In this case, you do not change the colors anymore. Instead, you make artistic choices to change the moods and emotions of that particular sequence. Color grading is about manipulating the colors and contrasts that intensify the visual tone and explain your story to the world.</p><p>Color correction can be enough if you want to keep the video realistic. However, color grading is essential if you want to imply emotions and feelings in your content. Following is an essential step-by-step guide to color grading.</p><h3 id="Basic-Steps-of-Color-Grading-1"><a href="#Basic-Steps-of-Color-Grading-1" class="headerlink" title="Basic Steps of Color Grading"></a>Basic Steps of Color Grading</h3><p>If you are a beginner, the color grading process can be tricky without expertise. Hence here are the basic steps of color grading a video.</p><h5 id="1-Color-correcting-1"><a href="#1-Color-correcting-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Color correcting"></a>1. Color correcting</h5><p>Correcting the colors and balance will always be the first step before you can color-grade footage. Next, the video must be normalized and should seem natural before you intensify the overall look.</p><h5 id="2-Match-the-colors-1"><a href="#2-Match-the-colors-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Match the colors"></a>2. Match the colors</h5><p>In the next step, we balance the contours between color-corrected footage and color grading. Then, you can use LUTs (Look Up Tables) to match the individual colors to the scheme.</p><h5 id="3-Shot-to-shot-matching-1"><a href="#3-Shot-to-shot-matching-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Shot-to-shot matching"></a>3. Shot-to-shot matching</h5><p>The next integral step is to match the colors between all the shots so we can achieve a unified look. The contrasting appearance of shots can make them look unprofessional and poorly cinematic.</p><h5 id="4-Adjust-the-mood-and-emotions-1"><a href="#4-Adjust-the-mood-and-emotions-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Adjust the mood and emotions"></a>4. Adjust the mood and emotions</h5><p>A well-executed color grading can potentiate the emotions in a shot. Use your artistic choices and tools from editing software to imply the director’s feelings in the video.</p><h5 id="5-Make-the-final-adjustments-1"><a href="#5-Make-the-final-adjustments-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Make the final adjustments"></a>5. Make the final adjustments</h5><p>As the final opportunity, tweak hues and chroma to ensure the colors match your palette in each scene. But, again, do not overdo anything, and play with colors to nudge the moods in the shot.</p><p>If your footage is the cake, color grading is the cherry on top that enhances the final look. You can instantly evoke connotations and bring the audience to a different page with some professional color grading.</p><p>However, while color correcting and grading, there are a few things that you should take care of. Here is a list of some To-do’s and Not To-do’s in the post-production edit.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Things-To-Consider-About-the-Editing-Environment-1"><a href="#Part-4-Things-To-Consider-About-the-Editing-Environment-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Things To Consider About the Editing Environment"></a>Part 4. Things To Consider About the Editing Environment</h2><p>Before you begin color-grading or color-correcting, here are some essential things to consider that can dramatically improve the results.</p><h5 id="1-Neutral-editing-environment-1"><a href="#1-Neutral-editing-environment-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Neutral editing environment"></a>1. Neutral editing environment</h5><p>Funky neon lights or fluorescent lights in the background can dominate your vision. As compensation, you will be over-saturating your footage with colors.</p><p>Make sure to use only white, neutral light with a CRI (color rendering Index) of at least 90. It will decrease inconsistencies as much as possible.</p><h5 id="2-Using-might-shifts-orange-screen-1"><a href="#2-Using-might-shifts-orange-screen-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Using might shifts&#x2F;orange screen"></a>2. Using might shifts&#x2F;orange screen</h5><p>People often activate night shifts or orange screens to protect their eyes from excessive strain. Resultantly, the screen appears dull and orange-y.</p><p>Since this alters the actual colors of the video, the results are undermined. So make sure to turn off all technologies that can sabotage the grading.</p><h5 id="3-Control-the-light-1"><a href="#3-Control-the-light-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Control the light"></a>3. Control the light</h5><p>It is necessary to control the amount of light that enters your working space area. Excessive light alters your color perception and hence obstructs achieving a balanced contour.</p><p>Ensure that the light does not directly falls on the screen or your eyes. You must maintain an adequate distance from the screen to see nuances as you grade.</p><p>After completing all the fundamentals of color correcting and color grading, let’s demonstrate how to do it in real-time.</p><p>Choosing good software can be chaos.

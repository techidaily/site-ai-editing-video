And why not when it allows users to communicate via different channels, including video calls, texts, media, voice calls, and files through private channels.</p><p>The digital platform is under Discord Inc and became official a while back. It operates under multiple operating systems, including macOS, Android, Linux, iOS, Android, iPadOS, and web browsers. As a result, it is an excellent way for everyone. The platform has risen to fame in the last six months, with many people using it.</p><p>As much as the platform is doing great, many things often arise, especially creating <strong>Discord GIF Avatar</strong>.

It includes relevant information about an <strong>animated avatar for Discord</strong> or GIF discord avatar. Read through the summary below.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Why Discord Is Becoming Popular Recently?](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [Why Discord Emojis?](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [How to Create Discord Emoji GIF?](#Part 3)</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-is-Discord-Becoming-Popular-Recently"><a href="#Part-1-Why-is-Discord-Becoming-Popular-Recently" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why is Discord Becoming Popular Recently?"></a>Part 1 Why is Discord Becoming Popular Recently?</h2><p>How often do you visit social media? You probably know that the current trending networking platform is Discord if it is frequent. After all, it has risen to fame with millions of users in no time. Plus, the introduction of the <strong>GIF Avatar Discord</strong> has left many fans amazed with the application. You can also confirm its popularity with the many friends using it.</p><p>Discord features multiple good points that explain why most people love it, including the <strong>avatar Discord GIF.</strong> However, many people still question its popularity and its rise recently. As a result, this section will answer this question using relevant facts.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>It is suitable for gaming communication:</strong> Discord is primarily popular among gamers. The platform is new, but it has quickly overtaken its competitors, Skype and TeamSpeak. Why? Many gamers consider it a revolutionized application that solves all their worries making gaming communication bigger and better. Before Discord, gaming communication was difficult and dangerous. After all, you need to share personal Skype details that connect with your phone, making it a not-safe option. When we consider TeamSpeak, you realize that it is limiting with the option available since you only have a voice call. Discord brings out the best network channel; gamers and friends have quickly started using it.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Most services are free: Discord includes multiple benefits that make</strong> communication straightforward and convenient. Luckily, most of the services available are free, meaning that almost everyone can access them. As a result, many people would quickly settle for Discord compared to other platforms since you can get so much at no cost. Currently, they have the <strong>Discord Nitro gif avatar</strong>, which is affordable and multiplies the fun.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create Discord bots are no cost:</strong> Discord allows users to create bots for free without including any hosting fee hence an affordable option.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Constant updates that match the audiences’ needs: Things change in no time for Discord</strong>. Why? The developers are active and listen to the community’s opinion of what they want and why they need it. Therefore, it delivers the show that people urgently need leading to popularity rise.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>It rarely includes ads in private chats:</strong> A platform can become frustrating, mainly when it features multiple ads every minute. However, Discord is different since it almost has no ads. Therefore, people can freely chat with friends and other gamers.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Discord is safe:</strong> The settings under Discord are safe since they include suitable privacy options and monitoring. Thus, it is a safe option. But many people often raise the question of open chatting in apps and the security issues that come with them. Many people can confirm that Discord is a safe option and if you feel otherwise, ensure that you only add friends you know.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Discord-Emojis"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Discord-Emojis" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?"></a>Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?</h2><p>From the information above, you can tell that Discord’s primary role is communication. And we all know that emojis are the real deal in every conversation since emojis easily communicate our feelings. Currently, most platforms with messaging options include emojis to multiply the fun. The same case happens for Discord emojis. They are there to make communication appealing, interesting, funny and reveal how you feel about a situation.</p><p><strong>Importance of Discord emojis</strong></p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Emojis help you to communicate the right emotions</strong>. Sometimes, it’s impossible to express the right feelings using words, and emojis come to the rescue in such situations. Of course, they are useless for formal communication, but Discord holds a considerable weight for various issues.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>They are fun and exciting</strong>. Sometimes you can choose to use an emoji instead of writing some phrase, and this option works for all. Besides, it feels good to see different emojis instead of a long paragraph that tells the same story.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Emojis make communication easy</strong>. We are in the 21st century with multiple revolutionary changes with our communication channels. Young people prefer emojis for different conversations.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>It offers a sense of presence in a conversation</strong>. People believed that they could only hold exciting discussions when they were together. Over time, this statement has been proved impossible since we can’t always be there to hold serious talks. We need Discord emojis since they give a sense of physical presence.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>They liven up a serious conversation</strong>. Have you ever noticed, people tend to include emojis when having serious talks making them more casual and creating a friendly environment that suits everyone? And this trick often works.</p><p>Discord emojis are conversation aids that every communication channel need. Why not, when it gives a sense of friendliness. Try out the Discord emojis and discover the simplest ways to make a conversation lively.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-Discord-Emoji-GIF"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-Discord-Emoji-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Create Discord Emoji GIF"></a>Part 3 How to Create Discord Emoji GIF</h2><p>There are two popular ways to create an emoji <strong>Discord GIF avatar, Discord Nitro animated avatar</strong> and <strong>Discord GIF avatar without Nitro.</strong> The emoji GIF you make depends on the Nitro version you are using.</p><p>Creating a Discord account is simple and free, not even considering the hosting cost. However, the developers include the Discord Nitro version, which contains multiple features that make conversations bigger and better. However, the Nitro version is a paid subscription of $4.99 monthly. Creating a discord emoji GIF is quite simple if you are under the later version. After all, it includes the available GIF options that you can choose from depending on your taste. However, if you are under the free option, you won’t have this option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/discord-emoji-gif-1.jpg"                      alt="how to make Discord emojis"                ></p><p>For standard Discord users, things work differently.

While many users record the entire video in slow motion, there are others who need only a particular section of a clip to play at a reduced speed. Nevertheless, slowing down footage is no longer rocket science, thanks to the advancements in technology, and the availability and ease of access to relevant apps.</p><p>That said, here you will learn what is needed to record a video in slow motion, and how to get the job done in a simple way.

Some of the most common ones include:</p><ul><li><strong>Add Focus</strong></li></ul><p>If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.</p><ul><li><strong>Skill or Style Demonstration</strong></li></ul><p>When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.</p><ul><li><strong>Replays</strong></li></ul><p>Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.</p><ul><li><strong>Observation</strong></li></ul><p>Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.</p><ul><li><strong>Add Suspense</strong></li></ul><p>When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.</p><p>In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.</p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Apply the Smooth Slow-Motion Effect in Post-Production?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">When to Use Slow Motion?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-Slow-Motion-Videos-via-Recording-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-Slow-Motion-Videos-via-Recording-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Make Slow Motion Videos via Recording?"></a>Part 1: How to Make Slow Motion Videos via Recording?</h2><p>The fact is, the playback speed of a video is inversely proportional to the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >frames per second <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (FPS) it has been recorded in.

Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.</p><p>For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode</strong></p><p>Launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the <strong>SLO-MO</strong> mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-slow-motion-capture-mode.jpg"                      alt="iphone slow motion capture mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Recording Preferences</strong></p><p>Tap the number at the top-right corner to switch between <strong>120</strong> FPS and <strong>240</strong> FPS as needed.

Wondershare Filmora is this, plus a lot more, its convenient and intuitive user interface is also something we believe will feel welcoming to users. Speaking of Handbrake, while effective and great for batch encoding — if you want to resize more than one video we recommend having Handbrake handy — its bare-bones interface can be intimidating. Regardless, both programs are convenient to utilize and perfectly capable of doing the task at hand with relative ease.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/2024-approved-3-ways-to-create-motion-text-effects-for-your-video/"><u>2024 Approved 3 Ways to Create Motion Text Effects for Your Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/new-deleting-white-background-in-photoshop-is-hard-no-for-2024/"><u>New Deleting White Background in Photoshop Is Hard?

It’s a close-up video effect allowing viewers to transit to the next clip from the eye. This effect is commonly used by musicians and travel bloggers to give their videos a more cinematic feel. So, without wasting time, let’s learn how to create an eye zoom transition with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><strong><em>Preparation:</em></strong></p><p>First, you need to create a close-up eye video. Although you can do that with your digital camera, a standard smartphone should do it just fine. Just ask a friend or family member to use your phone’s rear camera to record your eye centered on the screen. Ensure that the eye is as close as possible and you don’t lose focus. The camera should be around 10cm away from your face. And lest I forget, the flash should be ON.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/close-up-eye-video.gif"                      alt="create a close-up eye video"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Create-an-Eye-zoom-Transition"><a href="#How-to-Create-an-Eye-zoom-Transition" class="headerlink" title="How to Create an Eye-zoom Transition"></a>How to Create an Eye-zoom Transition</h2><h5 id="Step-1-Align-the-video-clips-on-Filmora"><a href="#Step-1-Align-the-video-clips-on-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Align the video clips on Filmora"></a>Step 1 Align the video clips on Filmora</h5><p>After recording a close-up eye video, add it on Wondershare Filmora and duplicate it.

A “montage” isn’t just for movies. Music artists use montages to tell stories that often describe their emotions and experiences; writers create poetry and prose contained in such an artistic form, and painters often use this art form. However, many people are most familiar with the term associated with movies: a montage is essentially a collection of images or scenes that populate a movie with music.</p><p>If you’ve seen any blockbuster Hollywood films in the last ten years, you’ve probably seen some Montage. The Montage is a sequence that takes place over a set period and shows us how the lead character goes from being an ordinary person to an extraordinary one. The difference between these two states is dramatic, so we see so many montages in movies. They are meant to grab your attention and excitingly introduce a character.</p><h2 id="Purpose-of-Montage"><a href="#Purpose-of-Montage" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Montage"></a>Purpose of Montage</h2><p>Montage movies are made up of a compilation of short yet powerful scenes put together to make one movie or project.

Of course, Montage can be used to show events such as battles or dancing. It can also describe emotions, including sadness, happiness, and sarcasm.

The word montage is French for “to construct from many parts .”Montages can now be seen everywhere in film and television, from silent films to blockbuster action movies.</li><li>This is frequently used in narratives when the story needs to advance quickly. The characters are going somewhere or doing something else not within the context of the moment in time that represents them.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="4-Methods-to-Resize-a-WebM-File"><a href="#4-Methods-to-Resize-a-WebM-File" class="headerlink" title="4 Methods to Resize a WebM File"></a>4 Methods to Resize a WebM File</h2><p>People resize videos for many reasons, the most common one being to reduce file size. Others might be to meet a specification, or for compatibility. When you resize a video file, you reduce its file size considerably- making it load faster on devices, reduce processing time, and save a lot of space. Most people prefer watching videos that are smaller in size compared to larger ones, that’s why some social media sites like Instagram, Tiktok, etc have preferred video resolutions, so if you are a user on these sites you might want to resize your video to fit.</p><p>The biggest concern most people have about resizing videos is whether it will retain its quality, another concern is that you don’t want to crop out your video while resizing. If the format of the video is mp4, wmv, avi, etc which usually have very large size, resizing it might be a bit of a problem because the video quality will reduce a lot, but if it’s a WebM video file, you can still achieve a good video quality even after multiple compression or changing its resolution, that’s because its codecs- VP8 and VP9 were designed specifically for that, and it’s supported by all browsers.</p><p>In the course of this article, we’re assuming you already have a WebM video and you want to resize it, and still maintain its quality so you can upload on your favourite websites without any hassles. We have handpicked some proven methods to help you with that, let’s see them:</p><h2 id="Method-1-Resize-WebM-file-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Method-1-Resize-WebM-file-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Resize WebM file with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Method 1: Resize WebM file with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Wondershare <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great video editing software that comes with a lot of features. You can easily perform basic editing techniques in a few minutes. It also comes with lots of filters to make your videos pop.</p><p>For video resizing, Filmora offers you a couple of options: First you have an option of changing the resolution just before you export your video; you also have the option of cropping your videos to your preferred size and cutting out redundant parts of your videos to save space; but the third option is what we’ll show you in this guide, because we imagine you already have your video exported and you just want to resize. You can easily do that by changing the aspect ratio and we’ll show you in a few steps:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to the official Wondershare Filmora website and download the software.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and double click to launch.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Change your aspect ratio. When you launch Filmora, you’re allowed to choose your preferred aspect ratio on the start page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-1.png"                      alt="resize-webm"                ></p><p>Select your preferred aspect ratio from the list of options- 16:9 (widescreen), 4:3 (standard), 1:1 (Instagram), 9:16 (portrait). For example, if you import a 16:9 video file into Filmora, and set it to 1:1 aspect ratio then, the final output file will be 1:1, which is the perfect aspect ratio for Instagram posts.</p><p>You’ll see below that I selected 1:1 for instagram. After you are done selecting your preferred aspect ratio, hit ‘New Project’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-2.png"                      alt="resize-webm"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Import your WebM video. After you must have selected your preferred aspect ratio, the next step is to import the video you want to resize; you can do this by clicking on the import icon shown below. Once done, drag the video to the timeline also shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-3.png"                      alt="resize-webm"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-4.png"                      alt="resize-webm"                ></p><p>A floating window will appear and you’ll be asked to change project settings to match the media. Click on ‘Keep project settings’. Filmora will change the aspect ratio of the original video you imported to your preferred aspect ratio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-5.png"                      alt="resize-webm"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-6.png"                      alt="resize-webm"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Save your video. Once the video is now properly placed in the timeline, next thing is hit ‘export’ to save your video. You can go to the ‘format tab’ to change the video output format to WebM or whatever format you choose then hit ‘Export’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-7.png"                      alt="resize-webm"                ></p><h2 id="Method-2-How-to-resize-WebM-file-with-VLC"><a href="#Method-2-How-to-resize-WebM-file-with-VLC" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: How to resize WebM file with VLC"></a>Method 2: How to resize WebM file with VLC</h2><p>VLC is a free and open source multimedia player. It is arguably the best media player out there and that’s for a reason- it can play almost everything without the need for any external codecs.</p><p>The playback feature is amazing but that’s not the only thing it can do. VLC outshines most other media players because of some extra features it possesses. It resizes and converts media files, downloads and adds subtitles, records screen, as well as is customizable in settings and expandable via plugins.</p><p>What we want to use in this guide is its media resizing feature, so let’s show you how you can use it in these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download VLC Media player from the official VLC page and install it on your windows or Mac PC.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Launch VLC after installing by double-clicking on the software.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click “Media” in the toolbar.</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Select “Convert &#x2F; Save”. You can also tap shortcut keys Ctrl + R to quickly open a new window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-8.png"                      alt="resize-webm"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Click “Add”. You can load one or more video files. Here, I’ll choose a colour grading video on my desktop. You can see it has the extension ‘.webm’. After loading the video file you want to resize, click “Convert &#x2F; Save” again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-9.png"                      alt="resize-webm"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-10.png"                      alt="resize-webm"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Choose your desired output profile type. With VLC, you can resize video to MP4, WebM, TS, and other formats.</p><p><strong>Step 8</strong>: Click the settings icon to access the settings window and select the video codec where you can adjust parameters like frame rate, bitrate, resolution, etc to change video file size. I changed the frame rate of my video to 30fps which is ideal for high quality videos. Also click the resolution tab and set your desired resolution then click save.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-11.png"                      alt="resize-webm"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-12.png"                      alt="resize-webm"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-13.png"                      alt="resize-webm"                ></p><p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Select the destination folder and click start. VLC will resize the video and retain most of its quality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-14.png"                      alt="resize-webm"                ></p><h2 id="Method-3-Resize-Videos-With-Ezgif"><a href="#Method-3-Resize-Videos-With-Ezgif" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Resize Videos With Ezgif"></a>Method 3: Resize Videos With Ezgif</h2><p>An alternative way to resize videos is by using Ezgif Video Resizer. If you are looking for a quick way to resize your WebM videos, this is a great tool. Ezgif is a free online video resizer with a very simple interface that can aid easy navigation for new users. The whole video resizing operation is pretty quick so you don’t have to worry about wasting so much time.</p><p>Ezgif supports various video formats like MP4, MOV, FLV, WEBM, MPEG, 3GP and more.

Sounds interesting? Keep reading the article to understand the context better.

Furthermore, the tool even lets you edit, customize, and share your photos and videos with ease.</p><p><strong>1. History and Current Policies</strong></p><p>Earlier, Google Photos used to offer unlimited storage to the users where they can save as many photos as they want, as long as the images were saved in ‘high-quality’ resolution. However, from June 01, 2021, Google changed its policies of using the app, and now the tool offers limited storage. If more space is needed, the users must subscribe to a paid plan.</p><p><strong>2. Accessibility</strong></p><p>Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.</p><p><strong>3. Deletion</strong></p><p>The files that are stored in Google Photos remain there for an indefinite duration, of course until the entire space is completely consumed. When you delete something, it is moved to the Trash and stays there for another 60 days, after which it is automatically deleted from the Cloud forever.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Stabilize-Videos-with-Google-Photos-on-Android-and-iPhone-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Stabilize-Videos-with-Google-Photos-on-Android-and-iPhone-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos on Android and iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos on Android and iPhone?</h2><p>Google Photos is available for both Android and iPhone smartphones, and as explained earlier, the app can be downloaded from Play Store and App Store respectively.

Furthermore, the tool even lets you edit, customize, and share your photos and videos with ease.</p><p><strong>1. History and Current Policies</strong></p><p>Earlier, Google Photos used to offer unlimited storage to the users where they can save as many photos as they want, as long as the images were saved in ‘high-quality’ resolution. However, from June 01, 2021, Google changed its policies of using the app, and now the tool offers limited storage. If more space is needed, the users must subscribe to a paid plan.</p><p><strong>2. Accessibility</strong></p><p>Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.</p><p><strong>3. Deletion</strong></p><p>The files that are stored in Google Photos remain there for an indefinite duration, of course until the entire space is completely consumed. When you delete something, it is moved to the Trash and stays there for another 60 days, after which it is automatically deleted from the Cloud forever.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Stabilize-Videos-with-Google-Photos-on-Android-and-iPhone-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Stabilize-Videos-with-Google-Photos-on-Android-and-iPhone-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos on Android and iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos on Android and iPhone?</h2><p>Google Photos is available for both Android and iPhone smartphones, and as explained earlier, the app can be downloaded from Play Store and App Store respectively.

It’s one of the most common text-revealing effects in video editing. This technique is often used to add titles or credits to a scene for cinematic vibes and creative effects.</p><p>While it may look complicated, it’s actually quite easy to create with a video editing program like Filmora. Filmora’s masking feature allows users to create impressive and eye-catching text reveals in their videos. For those looking for a tutorial on how to make text reveal, here’s a step-by-step guide to help you out.</p><h2 id="How-to-add-text-reveal-effect-using-Filmora’s"><a href="#How-to-add-text-reveal-effect-using-Filmora’s" class="headerlink" title="How to add text reveal effect using Filmora’s"></a>How to add text reveal effect using Filmora’s</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>First, make sure the video clips you are using are clear, with the subject moving across the frame.

AOMedia is a consortium of major tech companies including Google, Microsoft, Netflix, and Amazon. The AV1 codec is an improvement on VP9 in several ways, most notably in its ability to compress video more efficiently.</p><p>Although the AV1 codec is still in the early stages of development, it is already being adopted by some major tech companies. Netflix has announced that it will start using AV1 for its streaming service, and Google has said that AV1 will be the default codec for YouTube.</p><h3 id="How-can-streaming-platforms-and-users-benefit-from-a-new-codec"><a href="#How-can-streaming-platforms-and-users-benefit-from-a-new-codec" class="headerlink" title="How can streaming platforms and users benefit from a new codec?"></a>How can streaming platforms and users benefit from a new codec?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-2.jpg"                      alt="watching netflix on tv"                ></p><p><strong>The importance of codecs</strong></p><p>A codec is a device that encodes and decodes digital audio signals. Without a codec, your audio would sound garbled and distorted. There are two metrics to take into account to judge the performance of video codecs: quality and bitrate.</p><h3 id="The-benefits-of-the-new-codec"><a href="#The-benefits-of-the-new-codec" class="headerlink" title="The benefits of the new codec"></a>The benefits of the new codec</h3><p>Two of the most popular video formats, provide high-quality video at a relatively low bit rate.</p><p>The new AV1 codec offers several benefits for streaming platforms and their users. Take a look at a few of them:</p><ol><li><strong>Lower bitrate</strong></li><li><strong>Reduced costs for encoding</strong></li></ol><p>For streaming platforms, AV1 could lead to reducing costs for encoding as well as increasing quality and compatibility. For users, AV1 could improve streaming quality, especially on mobile devices.</p><ol><li><strong>Smaller size with better quality</strong></li></ol><p><strong>AV1 files</strong> will take up less space on your hard drive or be smaller in file size when streamed online. Since AV1 can compress video files to a much smaller size without sacrificing quality, users will be able to save data when streaming video on their devices!</p><ol><li><strong>More efficient</strong></li></ol><p>AV1 will use less processing power to decode a video compared to other video codecs. As a result, the streaming platforms can save on bandwidth costs, which can be passed on to users in the form of lower subscription prices eventually.</p><ol><li><strong>Royalty-free</strong></li></ol><p>The ultimate goal of AOMedia is to develop an open and royalty-free video codec that can be used by anyone. So, you will have better video quality, lower bandwidth costs, and faster loading times.</p><p>AV1 is just one of the many new technologies that are revolutionizing online media delivery. With its superior quality and efficiency, AV1 is poised to become the standard codec for online video in the years to come where everyone can access more affordable and high-quality videos.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Trends-of-Codec-War-AV1"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Trends-of-Codec-War-AV1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Trends of Codec War AV1?"></a>Part 2: What are the Trends of Codec War AV1?</h2><p>As we have already discussed, AV1 is a newer codec that promises better compression. This video format has already been widely used and gaining traction in the streaming industry. It is being used more for live broadcasts and other time-sensitive applications.</p><h4 id="Who-will-prevail"><a href="#Who-will-prevail" class="headerlink" title="Who will prevail?"></a>Who will prevail?</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-3.jpg"                      alt="video editing program on a computer"                ></p><p>Since both codecs have their pros and cons, it’s unclear which one will ultimately prevail. However, as the world moves towards more open standards for video codecs, there is growing concern that AV1 codec will be used to monopolize the market. While AV1 is free to use, it is encumbered by patents held by members of the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), which includes companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple.</p><h3 id="How-would-AV1-monopolize-the-market"><a href="#How-would-AV1-monopolize-the-market" class="headerlink" title="How would AV1 monopolize the market?"></a>How would AV1 monopolize the market?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-4.jpg"                      alt="a pile of us dollars"                ></p><p>The EU Commissions’ questionnaire, as reported by <a class="link"   href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-eu-antitrust-regulators-probing-tech-group-aoms-video-licensing-policy-2022-07-07/" >Reuters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, unveiled that the alliance and its members had been requiring companies to cross-license their patents for no charge to receive the AV1 format. These companies had no affiliation with AOM when AV1 was originally devised. This was a non-negotiable requisite for companies who owned patents that were necessary to contribute to the AV1 standard’s technical specifications.</p><p>As a result, this action is concerned to hinder innovation and thus prevents the new entities feasible to flourish. Therefore, there is a growing movement to antitrust AV1 which has been investigated by the European Commission.</p><h3 id="What-happened-after-the-AV1-Antitrust-Investigation"><a href="#What-happened-after-the-AV1-Antitrust-Investigation" class="headerlink" title="What happened after the AV1 Antitrust Investigation"></a>What happened after the AV1 Antitrust Investigation</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-5.jpg"                      alt="google logo"                ></p><p>The European Commission is looking into whether this licensing scheme violates antitrust law and whether the companies involved are colluding to keep AV1 closed off to competitors. The investigation is in its early stages, and no formal charges have been filed against Google at this time.</p><p>However, if the Commission finds that Google has indeed abused its market position, it could order Google to make changes to AV1 or face steep fines. Although the fines have yet to be determined, each company involved could ultimately pay up to 10% of their global turnover.</p><p>Nonetheless, this issue has shed light on the competitive landscape of the codec market. Well, although the outcome of the antitrust investigation is still uncertain, it is clear that it has the potential to shake up the codec market.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Should-You-Expect-in-the-Future"><a href="#Part-3-What-Should-You-Expect-in-the-Future" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Should You Expect in the Future?"></a>Part 3: What Should You Expect in the Future?</h2><h3 id="H-266-codec"><a href="#H-266-codec" class="headerlink" title="H.266 codec"></a>H.266 codec</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-6.jpg"                      alt="h.266 vvc logo"                ></p><p>H.266 is the next-generation video codec that is being developed to improve upon the current standard and the latest advances in video technology.

You can have a video of the same file size and bit rate but make it look significantly better.</p><ul><li><strong>Inter-Layer Prediction (ILP) usage</strong></li></ul><p>The H.266 codec uses a new type of inter-frame prediction called Inter-Layer Prediction (ILP). ILP allows the codec to exploit the correlations between different layers of a video signal. Therefore, it gives better results on image quality and file size when you encode a video with the H.266 codec.</p><ul><li><strong>Higher-quality video</strong></li></ul><p>We can expect higher-quality video content to become more widespread. This new codec will also enable new types of content, such as virtual reality and 360-degree video, to be streamed and enjoyed by a wider audience.</p><h3 id="AV2-codec"><a href="#AV2-codec" class="headerlink" title="AV2 codec"></a>AV2 codec</h3><p>The AV2 codec is an improvement on the current AV1. The AV2 codec is said to be more efficient and have better quality than the AV1 codec. It is still in development and is not yet available for use.</p><p>Since this codec is expected to provide better quality video at lower bit rates than other codecs, it would be ideal for use in video applications such as streaming and video conferencing. So, what can we expect from the AV2 codec in the future? Here are a few things to look out for:</p><ul><li>Improved quality at lower bitrates</li><li>Wider adoption in streaming and conferencing applications</li><li>Continued development and improvement</li></ul><h2 id="FAQs-To-cater-to-people-also-ask"><a href="#FAQs-To-cater-to-people-also-ask" class="headerlink" title="FAQs: To cater to people also ask"></a>FAQs: To cater to people also ask</h2><h3 id="1-How-do-I-open-an-AV1-file"><a href="#1-How-do-I-open-an-AV1-file" class="headerlink" title="1.

MP4 is a container format, which means it can hold multiple types of data. The data can be encoded using any codec, including AV1. Therefore, you can encode your content in AV1 and store it in an MP4 container for playback on the devices.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="How-to-Create-Sony-Vegas-Freeze-Frame"><a href="#How-to-Create-Sony-Vegas-Freeze-Frame" class="headerlink" title="How to Create Sony Vegas Freeze Frame"></a>How to Create Sony Vegas Freeze Frame</h2><h5 id="How-to-Make-Sony-Vegas-Freeze-Frame"><a href="#How-to-Make-Sony-Vegas-Freeze-Frame" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Sony Vegas Freeze Frame"></a>How to Make Sony Vegas Freeze Frame</h5><p>An easy yet powerful editor</p><p>Numerous effects to choose from</p><p>Detailed tutorials provided by the official channel</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The simplest of tools is Freeze-Frame.

We have done most of the work. Now we need to animate the graphics of the mouse cursor so that it clicks on the bell icon, thumb icon, and our subscribe button. The process is somewhat similar because we will need to add different keyframes. But still, let’s see it in detail.</p><h5 id="Step4-Animate-the-mouse-cursor"><a href="#Step4-Animate-the-mouse-cursor" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Animate the mouse cursor"></a>Step4 Animate the mouse cursor</h5><ul><li>Go to the “Mouse Cursor” icon layer and double-click on it. First, place the icon on the “Thumbs Up” so that when it animates in, it goes directly to the said icon. Then you have to add another keyframe after some time. And when you add a third one, place the “Mouse Cursor” icon on the subscribe button text.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-23.png"                      alt="adding new keyframes on the mouse cursor icon"                ></p><ul><li>Then add a similar pair of keyframes with some space from the last one and place the “Mouse Cursor” icon on the “Bell” icon.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-24.png"                      alt="mouse curson on the bell icon"                ></p><ul><li>The last keyframe we have to add will place this “Mouse Cursor” icon out of our view.

It can be a model hired by a brand, a social influencer, or maybe it’s you. Keep in mind the following things before recording:</p><ul><li>The person should get two different costumes.</li><li>All the actions need to be rehearsed before shooting</li><li>Show affinity and control of the camera.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-2.png"                      alt="character of the video"                ></p><h3 id="Shotting-Equipment"><a href="#Shotting-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="Shotting Equipment"></a>Shotting Equipment</h3><p>To record a professional video, you need a good camera. You can use a smartphone to record this footage. There is no need to have a tripod stand or any gear to hold the camera because the camera will be in a rotating position, the same as the subject’s hand.</p><p>For this, you need a filmmaker or any person living with you. Just give instructions as shown below to him to record a perfect video for yourself:</p><ul><li>Record the whole video in just one direction.</li><li>Don’t <strong>shake</strong> the camera because it gives blurry footage.</li><li>Ensure to <strong>focus</strong> on the subject during recording.</li><li>Don’t <strong>zoom</strong> in or out while recording the video.</li><li>Keep the subject in the <strong>middle</strong> of the frame during the recording process.</li><li>The <strong>hand rotation</strong> timing is the same as the camera’s rotation.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure to record one footage multiple times so that you can choose the perfect one later for editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-3.png"                      alt="smartphone for filming"                ></p><h3 id="Filming-of-the-First-Footage"><a href="#Filming-of-the-First-Footage" class="headerlink" title="Filming of the First Footage"></a>Filming of the First Footage</h3><p>To make the footage for the rotating video illusion, we have to record it at least twice to get crystal clear and high-resolution results.

The same is applicable for gamers who live stream their gameplay on Twitch. Instead of physically hanging green screens in the background, some video creators opt for virtual green screens. Yes, it is possible to shoot videos with a virtual green background, and you do not have to buy screen greens and deal with the problem of hanging them in the background.</p><p>The concept of using virtual greenscreen is rather new, but it is getting popular among amateur video creators who do not want to invest in purchasing green screens initially. When you use a virtual background to shoot your video, the actual physical background is replaced completely with a virtual green background. Thereafter, you have to replace this virtual background with anything by using a video editor. In this article, we will illustrate how to use a virtual green screen to shoot video.</p><h2 id="1-Free-Virtual-Green-Screen"><a href="#1-Free-Virtual-Green-Screen" class="headerlink" title="1. Free Virtual Green Screen"></a>1. Free Virtual Green Screen</h2><p>In order to shoot a video with green virtual background, you cannot shoot your video with your regular camera app. Otherwise, your physical background will get recorded, and replacing that through video editor is going to be time-consuming. Therefore, there are specific apps available through which you have to shoot your video so that your physical background gets completely replaced by virtual greenscreen in real-time.</p><p>Snap Camera from Snapchat is a free app through which you can shoot your video to get a virtual green background. The app comes with a Green Screen filter that makes this virtual background effect possible. However, you will need a camera recording app that can record your video with green screen effects from Snap Camera. We will be using OBS Studio for recording the video which is also available for free. Snap Camera is compatible with Windows 10 and Mac 10.11+, and hence, you can use it to shoot video from your computer webcam. Here are the steps to follow –</p><p>Step 1: Download and install <a class="link"   href="https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/" >Snap Camera app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer.</p><p>Step 2: Set up your webcam perfectly so that its angle is direct to your face.</p><p>Step 3: Open Snap Camera app and you will see yourself on the app through your webcam. Select the appropriate Lens(filter) and you have to select Green Screen Snap Filter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-virtual-green-screen.jpg"                      alt="free virtual green screen"                ></p><p>Step 4: You should see a green virtual background by now.

Most of the people check their mobile phones every 2 minutes – did they receive a new message?</p><p>What about different kinds of notifications – reactions on social network, or the ones which inform us about breaking news, or, to-do lists? People are well-connected to Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and sometimes, we just want to update our accounts with just photos or new videos we took on the go. Sometimes, we have a perfect footage we took with our Android, but we have no idea, or just no time to edit our stunning video clips on the computer.</p><p>Yes, changing or adjusting a video shouldn’t be that hard – you shouldn’t be obligated to turn to Adobe Premiere Pro or other “heavy” software in order to have a video to your whole liking. Therefore, we have mobile applications just for editing our videos, in a simple, and fast way (thank you, mobile developers!).</p><p>In this article, we will be discussing how to crop a video on Android, but since most android devices don’t have this option, you will need to do it externally, by downloading and using different apps. So, more concretely, we will touch upon how to crop our video clips using following apps: Google Photos, Clideo, and Filmora.</p><h2 id="Using-Google-Photos"><a href="#Using-Google-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Using Google Photos"></a>Using Google Photos</h2><p>In case you have Android, the Google Photos app will be there – it’s free and in most cases, already installed and ready to serve you. If you can’t find Google Photos, just find it and download it from the Google Play Store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-1.jpeg"                      alt="crop-video-android"                ></p><p>First off, you just open the application and allow it to access photos and media on your device. Tap the video you would like to crop. Then, click on Edit: it will launch the in-app video editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-2.jpeg"                      alt="crop-video-android"                ></p><p>At the bottom, you will see the Crop option and hit on it, which will result in appearing a cropping box around your video clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-3.jpeg"                      alt="crop-video-android"                ></p><p>Once you see little icons at the bottom, you need to choose the first one – it’s the Ratio button, through which you can choose the aspect you would like to apply.

Rocky (1976)</strong></p><p>One of the most notable montages is available in the 1976 action movie, the Sylvester Stallone-starrer “Rocky”. The type of video montage that is visible in this movie is rhythmic in nature, showcasing the training the character undergoes. This is edited with a musical background score, summarising some shots’ full training progression process.</p><p>To add an emotive tone to the video, music is added to the video clip that engages audiences to feel the character’s passion. A rhythmic style of video montage technique is used to cut the shorts as per the content. The lengths of each clip are not similar and differ as per the action going on in the scene.</p><p><strong>2. Mulan (1998)</strong></p><p>Video montages are also visible in animated movies, as seen in the 1998 version of Disney’s “Mulan”.

Creed (2015)</strong></p><p>Like in the Rocky movie, its 2015 sequel, “Creed”, also has a video montage. Here, the clips in the sequence are also used to depict the intense training progress. However, where it differs from the rhythmic formula is that the sequence highlights the emotional journey or determination of Adonis Creed to succeed.</p><p>Plus, this video montage is a homage to the original version; the tonal effect is further noticeable in the scene of Rocky’s health deterioration against Creed’s training.

This is edited with a musical background score, summarising some shots’ full training progression process.</p><p>To add an emotive tone to the video, music is added to the video clip that engages audiences to feel the character’s passion. A rhythmic style of video montage technique is used to cut the shorts as per the content. The lengths of each clip are not similar and differ as per the action going on in the scene.</p><p><strong>2. Mulan (1998)</strong></p><p>Video montages are also visible in animated movies, as seen in the 1998 version of Disney’s “Mulan”. The scene in question is where the song “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” plays while Mulan undergoes strict training for the military from the male lead. A sequence of shots showing her progress is shown.</p><p>Here, the video montage is shown with the background music that perfectly aligns with what is occurring in the video. The visuals and the audio in the background cohesively show the main character’s struggle, which creates an emotional response in the audience. Therefore, the style of video montage here falls under tonal or overtonal categories.</p><p>Watch this <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMX5zkYnGB0" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get an idea of how music and visuals can partner for tonal video montages.</p><p><strong>3. Creed (2015)</strong></p><p>Like in the Rocky movie, its 2015 sequel, “Creed”, also has a video montage. Here, the clips in the sequence are also used to depict the intense training progress. However, where it differs from the rhythmic formula is that the sequence highlights the emotional journey or determination of Adonis Creed to succeed.</p><p>Plus, this video montage is a homage to the original version; the tonal effect is further noticeable in the scene of Rocky’s health deterioration against Creed’s training. Thus, it juxtaposes the two scenes, creating an emotional impact on viewers to root for the main character.</p><p>Watch this <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NH1A6CLIrY" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to understand <strong>what is a montage video</strong> of the tonal type.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Creative-Montage-Ideas-for-Social-Media-1"><a href="#Part-2-Creative-Montage-Ideas-for-Social-Media-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

A Complete Guide for Beginners to Create These Transitions Using Their Camera at Home</h2><p>You must have seen it in videos when a scene changes to another place or time. How is it possible? Video transitions are a post-production technique that connects two different shots together. And it makes the whole video goes smooth and fluent.</p><p>Hopping directly from one clip to the next looks pretty queer. It disturbs the whole dynamics and charm of the video. To avoid this, we use video transitions. This makes the video appear much smoother and more linked.</p><p>You may think it is not easy, but after reading this article, you will know how simple it is. All you need is a camera and a few skills. In this article, we will focus on different in-camera transitions and let you know how to edit in a powerful video editor <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Whip-Your-Camera"><a href="#Whip-Your-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Whip Your Camera"></a>Whip Your Camera</h2><p>You may have noticed that when an object moves quickly, the camera creates a blurred image of the object. We call it motion blur. The idea with this transition is to cut and paste your shots together by whipping your camera at the end of your first shot and at the beginning of your second one. This effect depends on two aspects. The first is by the speedy motion of the object out of the frame, and the second is by the camera’s movement.</p><p><strong>Here is a stepwise guide for you to try</strong></p><ol><li>Plan your shots, where and in what direction you will make the whip.</li><li>Then take the first shot and whip the camera at the end of the shot in the direction the object is moving.</li><li>For the next shot, whip the camera into the action and complete the shot.</li><li>Import both shots in your editing tool and find the point of blur in both.</li><li>Cut and paste them to add a blurring effect to your video.</li></ol><p>You can whip your camera in any direction you want. Make sure the movement is fast enough to create a motion blur.</p><p>The result would be a smooth transition from the first shot to the second, as in this clip:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/whip-your-camera.gif"                      alt="whip your camera"                ></p><h2 id="Fill-The-Frame"><a href="#Fill-The-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Fill The Frame"></a>Fill The Frame</h2><p>In this in-camera transition technique, you must fill the frame with an object or subject.

Unfortunately, some social media platforms like Instagram require your video to be short. Therefore, many people wonder how to cut a video to make it easier to share. If you’re wondering how to cut video for Instagram on Mac, you’re in luck. This article shares the best tools to use for this purpose.</p><p><strong>What You Should Know About Instagram Video</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-instagram-1.jpg"                      alt="cut-video-instagram"                ></p><p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p><p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p><p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page.

It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p><p>Most times, your video would be longer than that.

That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p><p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page.

It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p><p>Most times, your video would be longer than that.

That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p><p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page.

Does LumaFusion Have Color Grading?</h4><p>In answering this question, it’s essential to understand the difference between color correction and color grading. Both editing techniques have vital differentiating characteristics, so it’s wrong to use them interchangeably.</p><p>Color correction ensures that videos look as natural to the human eye as possible. If there’s a technical color error, for example, due to bad lighting, color correction helps fix that.</p><p>However, the aim of color grading isn’t fixing color mistakes but using colors to convey a mood, atmosphere, or style. Some videographers classify color correction as the first phase in the color grading process.</p><p>Generally, you can use LumaFusion to color correct your footage. However, you can’t color grade with the app except you decide to tamper with the color presets tab’s color sliders. Even at that, you wouldn’t get the perfect results you want.</p><p>Fortunately, LumaFusion allows you to import and apply LUT (look-up tables). With LumaFusion LUTs, you can color grade your footage to your satisfaction.</p><h4 id="2-How-To-Color-Grade-in-LumaFusion-3"><a href="#2-How-To-Color-Grade-in-LumaFusion-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

Color correction ensures that your video doesn’t remain flat or unexciting.</p><p>○ Create Your LUTs</p><p>LUT allows you to save specific color grades to use anytime you need them. This helps to save time by ensuring that you don’t develop color spaces all over again when working on various footage. You can also download as many free LUTs as you like.</p><p>○ Bring In a LUT</p><p>After creating LUTs, import and apply them to your LumaFusion. Next, blend or adjust your LUt by shifting the slider to get your desired effects. It’s that simple!</p><h4 id="3-Can-I-Use-Multiple-LUTs-in-LumaFusion-3"><a href="#3-Can-I-Use-Multiple-LUTs-in-LumaFusion-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Top-10-Sony-LUT-for-Different-Purposes"><a href="#Top-10-Sony-LUT-for-Different-Purposes" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Sony LUT for Different Purposes"></a>Top 10 Sony LUT for Different Purposes</h2><p>If you’ve ever worked in the color grading profession, you’re aware of how time-consuming and labor-intensive it is to achieve a specific look on a scene. To master color grading, you must practice constantly, one of the reasons for the existence of specialists in this field. While everybody can color grade, not everyone can do it well. People in this business have devised remedies to make the editing workflow considerably more accessible and less time-consuming.</p><p>Achieving a specific ambiance in a scene demands ongoing effort and naturally takes longer. LUTs, or Lookup Tables, were created as a result. LUTs are ideal for storing a set of colors to use later or in another program. A LUT is the most effective technique to color or alters your image’s colors.</p><h2 id="Benefits-of-using-LUTs"><a href="#Benefits-of-using-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of using LUTs"></a>Benefits of using LUTs</h2><p>There are numerous advantages to using lookup tables to edit your footage. We’ve already discussed that it helps to give your films a more polished and professional appearance, which is one of the primary explanations why individuals use LUTs, but there are many more.</p><h3 id="1-A-beginning-towards-professionalism"><a href="#1-A-beginning-towards-professionalism" class="headerlink" title="1. A beginning towards professionalism"></a>1. A beginning towards professionalism</h3><p>This is a fantastic approach for beginners to have a good idea of how to build their own trademark looks in their videos. The time it takes to develop your color grading craft is unavoidable. So, as a novice, LUTs will come in useful for you to establish your approach and save your ass, big time.</p><p>You’ll eventually come up with a blend of your own LUTs to use, resulting in your own LUT. Not only will LUTs aid in color grading learning, but they will also save funds and resources. You will not only devote time to learning color grading, but you will also spend a significant amount of money on color grading tools and equipment, such as software and color panels. You’ll see why color grading equipment is necessary when you get to this point.</p><p>However, for the time being, employing LUTs is the most cost-effective way to obtain a cinematic look.</p><h3 id="2-It-saves-your-time"><a href="#2-It-saves-your-time" class="headerlink" title="2. It saves your time"></a>2. It saves your time</h3><p>Because LUTs are predefined colors used to establish a specific look on a picture, they save you time. Having a trustworthy LUT to use for video will save the life of freelance editors who are constantly meeting commitments and modifications. Isn’t the purpose of color grading to generate a visual emotion for your movie? So, with LUTs, you can create one without going through the time-consuming process of manual color correction. Only one-color preset will be applied to all scenes in a single LUT.</p><p>However, there’s a good probability that it won’t look the same in all of the images. This is where you’ll adjust the colors to make them more evenly match the film. It’s nothing significant most of the time, just some little saturation adjustments, etc.</p><h3 id="3-Work-on-a-budget"><a href="#3-Work-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="3. Work on a budget"></a>3. Work on a budget</h3><p>Time spent in a color-grade suite may be highly costly, and it can lead your films to go over budget in order to achieve a specific aesthetic. LUTs, on the other hand, are available for free online or for a fee for more complex versions. Even if you buy your LUTs, you could save thousands of dollars based on the size of your film. LUTs can also assist you in meeting tight deadlines, and setting targets too optimistically is something I’m sure we’ve all done at some point.</p><p>Whether it’s a client or a personal project, things can often get pushed to the last minute, so having something in your arsenal that can save you time is always a good bonus. There are, however, projects where you need to appear competent without investing a lot of time on them due to budget limits; this is where a lookup table comes in handy because you can modify the complete style of your movie in a matter of seconds by pressing a few buttons. Even complicated editing can be completed quickly, giving you more time to work on other tasks that will earn you more money.</p><h3 id="4-It-provides-an-artistic-approach"><a href="#4-It-provides-an-artistic-approach" class="headerlink" title="4. It provides an artistic approach"></a>4. It provides an artistic approach</h3><p>LUTs are beneficial because they allow videos shot with cameras that shoot very dark, discolored images to have more vivid tones and contrast. This is excellent for grabbing viewers’ attention and making videos more intriguing and engaging. LUTs add an artistic element to videos and can help you develop a visual artistic identity for your videos if you use the same colors. Another advantage of LUTs is that they enhance the color quality of videos shot on smartphones with particular color schemes. Although this varies significantly from brand to brand, you can use LUTs to make a Smartphone video more vibrant and appealing.</p><h2 id="Top-10-Sony-LUT-for-Different-Purposes-1"><a href="#Top-10-Sony-LUT-for-Different-Purposes-1" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Sony LUT for Different Purposes"></a>Top 10 Sony LUT for Different Purposes</h2><p>The highlights in your videos will seem smooth with this set of Free Sony LUTs, while the shadows will add intensity and depth without sacrificing any details. It’s easy to use Sony LUTs in.CUBE and.LOOK versions, and they help you get the cinematic appearance you want.</p><h3 id="1-SLog2-SLog3-to-Enhanced-Rec709-LUTs"><a href="#1-SLog2-SLog3-to-Enhanced-Rec709-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="1.

If you do not know what it is, Wondershare has its own Drive, which allows you to save and remotely view your video files.</p><p>In the meantime, if you have a decent PC, you can enable “Hardware acceleration for video encoding.” This option will utilize as much computer power as you have to export the video and make the process significantly faster.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Steps-to-Create-Gold-Text-Effects-After-Effects"><a href="#Steps-to-Create-Gold-Text-Effects-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Create Gold Text Effects After Effects"></a>Steps to Create Gold Text Effects After Effects</h2><p>Have you always wanted to create the gold text effect in After effects but you don’t know how? This polished effect can make your video’s title stand out and is one of the best ways to create a stunning title for YouTube and Instagram clips. In this article, we will be looking at how to create the gold text using After Effects.</p><h2 id="Steps-to-Create-Gold-Text-Effects-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Steps-to-Create-Gold-Text-Effects-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Create Gold Text Effects After Effects"></a>Steps to Create Gold Text Effects After Effects</h2><p>Follow these steps to create a gold text effect in your After Effects video project;</p><p>Step1Start by creating an environment. To do that just right-click and choose “New Comp” and click “OK” to create one.</p><p>Step2Then we need to add fractal noise. To do that, click on “Effects and Presets” and type in “fractal” to choose “Fractal Noise.” You can double-click on it or drag it to the comp.</p><p>Step3Once this is done, you will need to do a little bit of housekeeping on the contrast and brightness. Increase the “Contrast” and reduce the “Brightness.”</p><p>Then go to the “Sub Settings” and reduce the “Sub Influence” down to zero.</p><p>Go to “Transform Option” and decrease the scale just a little bit. Then increase the “Scale Height” just a little.</p><p>Step4The next step is to add color to the scene. To do that, right-click on the layer and choose “New &gt; Solid.” Select the gold color and click “OK.” Do the same with the second layer.</p><p>Step5Now you want to blend both colors by choosing a blending mode. Hold the “Shift” key and “hyphen” or “&#x3D;” sign on the keyboard and choose “Overlay.”</p><p>Step6To make the color stronger, go to “Layer &gt; Solid Settings” and choose a color.</p><p>Step7Go back to “Comp 3.” Right-click on it and select “New &gt; Light” to add a new point of light.</p><p>Step8Go back to the project panel to click on “Comp 4” to add the environment. Right-click on the Comp 4 layer and make it an environment layer.</p><p>Step9In the options that appear, set “Appears in Reflections” to “Only” and you can then increase and decrease the color saturation until you have the desired result.</p><h2 id="Free-Gold-Text-Effects-Template-to-Use"><a href="#Free-Gold-Text-Effects-Template-to-Use" class="headerlink" title="Free Gold Text Effects Template to Use"></a>Free Gold Text Effects Template to Use</h2><p>As you can see from the steps above, creating your gold text effects can be quite difficult. The good news is that you can download pre-made titles that you can simply edit. The following are some of the best to choose from;</p><ol><li><strong>Christmas Title Template</strong></li></ol><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://mixkit.co/free-after-effects-templates/christmas-title-template-819/" >https://mixkit.co/free-after-effects-templates/christmas-title-template-819/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Despite the name, this is an ideal title for elegant projects or when you want your title to stand out.

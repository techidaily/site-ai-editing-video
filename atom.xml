There are currently more than 2.5 billion gamers, and most of them love watching gaming video content on YouTube. Whether people use a montage to parody gaming montages themselves or show off their skills, the effort and time put into them create impressive results.</p><p>We will explain how to create gaming montages and give you some tips that you might want to keep in mind to make epic videos.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Gaming-Montage"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Gaming-Montage" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Gaming Montage"></a>How to Make a Gaming Montage</h2><p>You have several options when it comes to creating gaming montages. You can include a random cut of great scenes, a mixture of the highlighted moments you found thrilling and would like to share with other gamers. In other cases, you’ll have to think of an engaging story in advance, then base your gameplay on this story.</p><p>Essentially, the workflow will be slightly different for these two scenarios. It’s much easier with the random cut type, especially when using a reliable video editor. Editing montages is as exciting as playing the game.</p><p>With that in mind, here is how to make a gaming montage.</p><h3 id="1-Decide-Your-Montage-Story-Type"><a href="#1-Decide-Your-Montage-Story-Type" class="headerlink" title="1) Decide Your Montage Story&#x2F;Type"></a>1) Decide Your Montage Story&#x2F;Type</h3><p>Deciding your montage type beforehand helps clear your mind and create an epic gaming montage that will keep viewers watching. It allows you to choose the relevant video clips for your gaming montage.</p><p>Choose the topic of the video and decide the length of each clip and the sequence of the clips. Be sure to put the most epic or funny clips in the last section of your video. And this will make your viewers watch the video until the end.</p><h3 id="2-Record-Your-Gameplay-Footage"><a href="#2-Record-Your-Gameplay-Footage" class="headerlink" title="2) Record Your Gameplay Footage"></a>2) Record Your Gameplay Footage</h3><p>The methods to capture the gameplay varies depending on the platform where the game is. The most important thing you have to keep in mind is to ensure your recorder supports Replay Buffer; this will allow you to record scenes that occurred minutes or seconds ago.</p><p>That means you do not need to record the gameplay the whole time and burn your hardware. Instead, you’ll capture the moment after interesting things occur.</p><p>Game consoles like PS4 allow you to record the video natively for a maximum of one hour with the gamepad. A capture card lets you record it longer than 60 minutes.</p><p>Once you’ve all the clips you want on your PC, head over to <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html" >https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and download Filmora and install the software on your computer. This program allows you to edit your video clips and add cool effects that will make viewers keep watching.</p><h3 id="3-Import-You-Videos-to-Media-Library"><a href="#3-Import-You-Videos-to-Media-Library" class="headerlink" title="3) Import You Videos to Media Library"></a>3) Import You Videos to Media Library</h3><p>You only have to import the videos to Filmora’s media library and then drag and drop them into the timeline, where you can start making the edits.</p><p>By right-clicking on the clip in your timeline, you’ll see the options to zoom, speed, change, split, or trim your videos. You can also add sound effects by going to the Audio Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gaming-montage-1.png"                      alt="How to make a game montage - import videos"                ></p><p>Import Videos</p><h3 id="4-Choose-Background-Music-for-Your-Montage"><a href="#4-Choose-Background-Music-for-Your-Montage" class="headerlink" title="4) Choose Background Music for Your Montage"></a>4) Choose Background Music for Your Montage</h3><p>Music will help make your gaming montage engaging. Make sure you use a license-free track if you plan to post it on social media.</p><p>Using copyrighted music tracks and uploading the video on social media platforms can lead to video strikes. Luckily, Filmora has loads of non-copyrighted music tracks.</p><p>Navigate to Stock Media, where you’ll find non-copyrighted music on Pixabay, and choose the one you prefer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gaming-montage-2.png"                      alt="How to make a game montage with Filmora - Choose Background Music"                ></p><p>Choose Background Music</p><h3 id="5-Edit-the-Gaming-Montage"><a href="#5-Edit-the-Gaming-Montage" class="headerlink" title="5) Edit the Gaming Montage"></a>5) Edit the Gaming Montage</h3><p>With Filmora’s auto gaming montage maker, you can watch the video clip with the music you have selected.

However, it is a simple concept for video editors where the encoding settings determine the frequency at which the whole picture is transmitted.</p><p>The <strong>Keyframe Interval</strong> is responsible for how often a keyframe is generated within the video. A keyframe, also known as an i-frame, is a single frame that contains all of the necessary information for displaying a video. If the Keyframe Interval is set too high, it could lead to visible compression without compromising the quality of a video.</p><p><strong>Keyframe Interval</strong> is essential in video streaming and recording, but it can be confusing. In this guide, we’ll help you understand this concept to enable you to create better animations.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Keyframe-Interval"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Keyframe-Interval" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Keyframe Interval"></a>Part 1. What Is Keyframe Interval</h2><p>Keyframe Intervals, also known as “Keyframe Frequency” in Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder (FMLE) and vMix or “GOP size” by some encoders, is the frequency at which keyframes are generated in an animated sequence. This is an important parameter to consider when creating animations, as it can impact the animation’s file size, quality, and smoothness.</p><p>Keyframe Intervals are the distance in time between two keyframes. For example, if an animation is set to every 2 seconds interval and the frame rate is 30 per second, it means that every 60 frames, a keyframe is created.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/keyframe-interval-in-a-video.png"                      alt="keyframe interval in a video"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Keyframe-Interval-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Keyframe-Interval-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Does Keyframe Interval Work?"></a>Part 2. How Does Keyframe Interval Work?</h2><p>Keyframes are important in video and animation because they mark specific points in time that can be used to create a smooth and consistent transition between different states or images. The Keyframe Interval is the amount of time that passes between two keyframes.</p><p>In order to create a smooth and consistent transition, the Keyframe Interval must be carefully calculated. In a 60-frame-per-second video, a keyframe is recorded every 5 or 300 frames. Delta frames are “difference” frames that provide an incremental change from the previous frame.</p><p>Keyframes are different from delta frames in that a higher keyframe value results in a clearer video with fewer transmission artifacts and vice versa.</p><p>The Keyframe Interval can be adjusted to create a faster or slower transition between two keyframes. A shorter Keyframe Interval will create a faster transition, while a longer one will create a slower transition.</p><p>For example, if you want your transition to look smoother, use a longer interval, like two seconds. Conversely, a zoom effect over a 0.2-second interval will be quicker.</p><h2 id="Part-3-A-concept-closely-connected-to-Keyframe-Interval-Bitrates"><a href="#Part-3-A-concept-closely-connected-to-Keyframe-Interval-Bitrates" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. A concept closely connected to Keyframe Interval - Bitrates"></a>Part 3. A concept closely connected to Keyframe Interval - Bitrates</h2><p>The relationship between keyframes and bitrates is important to understand when creating video content. Keyframes are the frames in a video that are used to define the start and end points of an encoding process. The bitrate measures how much information is being transferred in a given time from one place to another.</p><p>When encoding video, keyframes are used to establish a consistent quality throughout the video. The bitrate is then used to determine how much information can be transferred without affecting the quality of the video. Thus, the higher the video’s bitrate, the better the quality.</p><p>Your mileage may vary regarding this explanation, as different encoders manage bitrates and keyframes in different ways.</p><p>For example, if you’re using an encoder like Wirecast, you might notice that broadcasting in a still background with someone talking results in a higher quality video as compared to a moving background. This can be reproduced using the same average bitrate and Keyframe Interval between them.</p><p>This happens because the delta frames have to share a lot more information to share in each frame in the video with a moving background. When you have an encoder like Wirecast, it’s working to keep your stream at an average bitrate. This can result in reduced quality if there is a lot of extra information in the <a class="link"   href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/delta-frame#:~:text=In%20interframe%20video%20coding%2C%20a,%2Dframes%20or%20B%2Dframes." >delta frames. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-4-What-You-Need-To-Know-To-Set-A-Right-Keyframe-Interval"><a href="#Part-4-What-You-Need-To-Know-To-Set-A-Right-Keyframe-Interval" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. What You Need To Know To Set A Right Keyframe Interval"></a>Part 4. What You Need To Know To Set A Right Keyframe Interval</h2><p>After understanding the important concepts in video editing, let’s see how to set the keyframe level in our videos appropriately.</p><p>Most streaming services will automatically set it for you based on your stream’s frame rate and bitrate. However, if you want to set the keyframe gap manually, there are a few things you need to keep in mind.</p><ul><li>Set the frame interval at 2 seconds. Do not increase it from 4 seconds.</li><li>Disable the “auto” keyframe feature.</li><li>To allow for b-frames, use an encoding profile higher than baseline and use IDR-based keyframes.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047406/19272" target="_top" id="2047406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-How-To-Change-The-Keyframe-Interval-On-OBS-Studio"><a href="#Part-5-How-To-Change-The-Keyframe-Interval-On-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Then, wil-l or how it affects your video’s performance?</p><p>In a stream, it determines the balance between smoothness and picture quality. A keyframe is a point that determines how often the entire frame is sent, as opposed to just the differences from the previous frame.</p><p>Therefore, if you set the Keyframe Interval higher, your video will be more stable with fewer artifacts but requires more bandwidth and processing power. Conversely, a lower Keyframe Interval value causes more artifacts but is less resource intensive.</p><p>A lower Keyframe Interval value will result in lower video quality, while a higher keyframe value will result in higher video quality. However, the optimal Keyframe Interval value can vary depending on the specific case.</p><p>For instance, you don’t need a higher Keyframe Interval for streaming a live video, but you have to use a higher Key Interval value for recording.</p><p>Video- What is the Maximum Bitrate &amp; Keyframe Interval for OBS</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>In this article, we’ve explored Keyframe Interval, how it works, and the relationship between keyframes and bitrates.

Before you start, make sure you put the camera on a tripod or a steady surface, so it doesn’t move while filming.</p><p>Step1 For the first shot, you must throw a jacket on a stool. Make sure it lands on the stool or wherever your talent is going to sit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_1.jpg"                      alt="throw a jacket on a stool"                ></p><p>Step2 Make a shot of your talent appearing from where the jacket landed. You can add some acting skills to make this shot more realistic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_2.jpg"                      alt="make a shot of your talent appearing"                ></p><p>Step3 Download Filmora to edit your footage. You can get started by going to their official website.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_3.jpg"                      alt="download filmora"                ></p><p>Step4 Now split the first clip on the frame where your jacket lands on the stool. Place it on the first track.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_4.jpg"                      alt="split the first clip on the frame"                ></p><p>Step5 Trim the second shot until the talents start acting and place it on the second track to match the first clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_5.jpg"                      alt="trim the second shot"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-an-Explosion-Appearance"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-an-Explosion-Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make an Explosion Appearance"></a>Part 3: How to Make an Explosion Appearance</h2><p>Step1 This effect is the easiest. You need to film the empty plate with just a background. Then let the talent enter the frame and jump into the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_6.jpg"                      alt="let the talent enter the frame"                ></p><p>Step2 Now import the clip into Filmora and place it onto the first video track.</p><p>Step3 Freeze the frame of the empty plate with just the background and extend it as necessary. Place the clip onto the second video track and trim it until the action of the talent jump starts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_7.jpg"                      alt="freeze the frame of the empty plate"                ></p><p>Step4 Delete the rest on the left. The trick is to use some explosion or smoke effect to hide the transition.</p><p>Step5 Use the green screen sample in the default menu here. Add some smoke effects available in film stock. Place it on the third video track and move it to hide the transition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_8.jpg"                      alt="use the green screen sample"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-Roof-Appearance"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-Roof-Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make Roof Appearance"></a>Part 4: How to Make Roof Appearance</h2><p>The last trick here is combining the techniques from the two previous effects.</p><p>Step1 First, record the empty plate with just a background. Let the talent jump in the frame and set up a green screen for the talent to jump in front of it. It will look like they’re falling from the ceiling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_9.jpg"                      alt="record the empty plate"                ></p><p>Step2 Now import the clip into Filmora again. Follow the steps from the second example so we have the subject appearing on the screen like this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_10.jpg"                      alt="import the clip into filmora again"                ></p><p>Step3 Add the green screenshot onto the third video track.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_11.jpg"                      alt="add the green screenshot onto the third video track"                ></p><p>Step4 Double-click on it, activate the setting window and then key out the background using the chroma key feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_12.jpg"                      alt="activate the setting window "                ></p><p>Step5 Move the clip until it covers only the first frame of the appearing clip. Now keyframe the following subject from the outer frame to the final position.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_13.jpg"                      alt="move the clip"                ></p><p>Step6 Now search for some smoke effects and put it upside down. So it looks like the ceiling is broken when the subject falls. Then add some camera shake to the fall.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_14.jpg"                      alt="search for some smoke effects"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014851/22899" target="_top" id="2014851">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014851" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014851/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step7 Drag the camera shake effect back to the top track and shorten it to an ideal length.

Here I’m Going to Share some of the Tips to Make a Better Event Videography</h2><p>There is no doubt that if you have an upcoming corporate event, you will want to record it using professional</p><p>corporate event video production. This is something that can’t be stressed enough. Providing video footage of events is an excellent method to raise people’s awareness of your brand, as well as interest in and enthusiasm for the work that your firm does.</p><p>Let’s start!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/event-videography.jpg"                      alt="event videography"                ></p><h2 id="1-A-quality-corporate-event-video-represents-your-business"><a href="#1-A-quality-corporate-event-video-represents-your-business" class="headerlink" title="1. A quality corporate event video represents your business"></a>1. A quality corporate event video represents your business</h2><p>People who are watching your corporate event video aren’t just learning about who your company is and what your company does. They’re also learning about your commitment to quality. If your event video looks like it was shot off the cuff by an employee on someone’s phone, people may assume you take that kind of approach to your business and service to your customers.</p><p>You don’t, but it’s an easy assumption to make. A professionally shot, high-quality video signals to viewers that your company appreciates quality and seeks it out in everything they do. It also shows your attention to detail and what they can expect when they choose your business to handle their own occasions or services.</p><h2 id="2-A-professional-videographer-is-capable-of-editing"><a href="#2-A-professional-videographer-is-capable-of-editing" class="headerlink" title="2. A professional videographer is capable of editing"></a>2. A professional videographer is capable of editing</h2><p>Videoing your corporate event is about more than just filming, it’s knowing how to cut the event together, how to mix the shots and the sound, and add music and any subtle effects or graphics that will make the video really shine. There is a lot that goes into post-production that an amateur simply cannot replicate.</p><p>Editing your video without the benefit of a dedicated studio with years of experience just won’t have the same</p><p>effect when it comes to amplifying the energy and mission of your event. It also will not show the level of detail that your video could contain if a professional corporate event video production company did it.</p><h2 id="3-A-professional-video-is-completed-on-schedule"><a href="#3-A-professional-video-is-completed-on-schedule" class="headerlink" title="3. A professional video is completed on schedule"></a>3. A professional video is completed on schedule</h2><p>It can take longer than you anticipate if you opt to handle your corporate or conference videos yourself or</p><p>delegate the task to one of your workers. Without a lot of post-production knowledge, it could take a lot of trial and error to put your material together in a way that produces the desired outcome.</p><p>If you’re trying to summarize an event and demonstrate to stakeholders or customers how effective it was, you might not have time for that. Even though unforeseen issues might always arise, if you and a competent</p><p>videographer agree on a finish date, they will be able to deliver. This is crucial if you want to utilize your video</p><p>to promote a recent event or for marketing purposes.</p><h2 id="4-A-skilled-videographer-avoids-interference"><a href="#4-A-skilled-videographer-avoids-interference" class="headerlink" title="4. A skilled videographer avoids interference"></a>4. A skilled videographer avoids interference</h2><p>A skilled videographer is trained to film an event without getting in the way, so things can keep going as usual.</p><p>If you’re not used to doing professional videography, you might not realize you’re bothering your guests and</p><p>messing up the event while you’re trying to film it. This can turn people off and hurt your finished product, as</p><p>well as the success of your event. If your occasion is streamed online, you don’t want the videographer to get in the way or become visible in the frame your live show.</p><h2 id="5-A-video-that-is-done-well-tells-a-story"><a href="#5-A-video-that-is-done-well-tells-a-story" class="headerlink" title="5. A video that is done well tells a story"></a>5. A video that is done well tells a story</h2><p>Companies with experience creating videos do more than just capture actions digitally, they also find the story</p><p>in the event they are recording and use their videography skills to tell that story. This storyline is defined in</p><p>what they choose to shoot, when they shoot it and how they edit it all together. It’s that storyline that is going</p><p>to capture the attention from the audience and give your video the desired impact.</p><p>It’s also going to stir up emotions and passion in your audience, creating momentum in your company and with your customers that will last until your next event. Remember that any video you share with your customers or employees is a video marketing exercise that helps you build brand awareness. Let your corporate event video reflect positively on your business.</p><h2 id="6-A-videographer-has-a-shot-list"><a href="#6-A-videographer-has-a-shot-list" class="headerlink" title="6. A videographer has a shot list"></a>6. A videographer has a shot list</h2><p>It is not enough to simply create a list; you must also put it to good use. The idea that you should plan your shot and then execute your plan is a fundamental element of production. Create a strategy and put it into action since your videographer will be knowing his job to adhere to this concept regardless of whether or not they are aware of it.</p><p>Also, get things you may or may not need for editing. It is usually excellent practice to use some B roll audio</p><p>and video, in addition to establishing shots, no matter what kind of event you are filming, be it a wedding or a business function. If you anticipate that it will be overly crowded during the event, take your creative shoton a pleasant day that occurs before the main event.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We sincerely hope that some of these pointers will be of assistance to you as you navigate the area of special</p><p>events videos. Whether you are able to employ all of them or not will depend on your client, the event, and</p><p>your own workflow; nonetheless, the takeaway from this anecdote is that you should be prepared for the</p><p>worst-case scenario and find that you are better equipped to offer the best possible results. There won’t be</p><p>many situations that you won’t be able to manage with grace and professionally if you have the ability to</p><p>remain calm, cool, and professional.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Splitting-Video-in-VSDC-Step-by-Step"><a href="#Splitting-Video-in-VSDC-Step-by-Step" class="headerlink" title="Splitting Video in VSDC [Step by Step]"></a>Splitting Video in VSDC [Step by Step]</h2><p>VSDC is a proper editor for freely available videos and has various controls.

According to recent reports, the site hosts over 265,000 photographers contributing to a library of over 3.5 million photos. Initially, all photos were under a creative commons license zero, meaning you could distribute the photos without restriction. However, following lobbying from some creators, all photos are now under the Unsplash license.</p><p>This means you can still copy, modify, share, and download images for free. However, under the new licensing terms, you cannot use unedited copies of the images for commercial purposes such as T-Shirt printing or branding and using the photos on a similar or competing service.</p><p>Most Unsplash users praise it for the following features:</p><ul><li>The library contains tons of high-resolution photos.</li><li>You can access the site through your web browser or the app available on Android and iOS devices.</li><li>There are no download limits to the photos, and everything is free.</li><li>Unsplash is a plugin for various content editing software such as Filmora 11, Adobe XD, and Figma.</li></ul><p>Despite all the positives, here are a few improvements to make Unsplash even better.</p><ul><li>The website lacks a free HD video library, which would be a great addition for aspiring content creators.</li><li>In addition, the search algorithm is not as accurate, and you may struggle to find suitable images for your subject matter.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139116/17108" target="_top" id="2139116">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139116" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139116/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="No-2-Shutterstock"><a href="#No-2-Shutterstock" class="headerlink" title="No.2 Shutterstock"></a>No.2 Shutterstock</h3><p>Another Pexels alternative to consider is Shutterstock.

In addition, the website offers different pricing models for each user, depending on your unique requirements. For example, you can subscribe to an image-only subscription that allows you ten image downloads monthly for $29. Alternatively, you can purchase the Mix and Match subscription that offers you 25 credits monthly to download different media from the site.</p><p>Currently, the website boasts a collection of over 200 million royalty-free images and over 10 million video clips. In addition, the company also offers a percentage-based compensation model to contributors, with first-timers earning up to 15% of content sales. Furthermore, the site continues to populate its library through the acquisition of different companies in a similar space.

However, a few tweaks to how you receive these creative assets make it slightly better. For example, StockSnap allows you to download ten free images from Shutterstock if what you need is unavailable in their library.</p><p>In addition, the platform also displays the most recent additions to their library in the top search results.

Even though OBS is a completely free application, its features are comparable to any premium video editor. We always look for available transition effects in a video editor and OBS takes it to the next level by allowing users to add custom transitions.</p><p>Among custom transitions, Stinger transitions have gained a lot of traction from the users. Stinger transitions are made popular by sports channels who use Stinger frequently whenever there is a change in the scene. We will illustrate how to add custom transitions in OBS and apply Stinger transitions in your video.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Stinger-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Stinger-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Stinger in OBS"></a>Part 1. What is Stinger in OBS</h2><p>Stinger is a special type of customized animated video transition effect that is available in the latest version of OBS Studio. It is a combination of a transparent video animation and a cut transition. Stinger begins with the transparent video animation that grows into full-screen overlay, and it is followed by the cut transition. After the cut transition, you place the next scene or video clip. You will notice Stinger transition whenever sports channels show an instant replay during a live match.</p><p>The transparent video animation starts on top of the current video you are editing. When the animation expands and covers up the entire screen, you place the cut transition, and thereafter, you place the next video clip or scene as per your requirement. Some customized stinger effect also includes audio effects along with video effect.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-add-stinger-transitions-to-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-add-stinger-transitions-to-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to add stinger transitions to OBS"></a>Part 2. How to add stinger transitions to OBS</h2><p>The Stinger transition is available on OBS Studio and Streamlabs, and both of them are open-source and free applications. Before you add stinger transition, you should have a video animation ready that you will play on top of the current video followed by the cut transition effect. You can download several stinger video animations from the internet and include any of them in OBS while adding stinger transition. Here are the steps on how to add a custom transition to OBS.</p><p>Step1 Go to Scene Transitions section and click on Effects option to open the drop-down menu.</p><p>Step2 From the drop-down menu, click on “Add: Stinger” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-stinger-obs.jpg"                      alt="add stinger obs"                ></p><p>Step3 Give a name to the Stinger transition and click Ok button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/name-stinger-transition-obs.jpg"                      alt="name stinger transition obs"                ></p><p>Step4 You will see Properties window now. Click on Browser button against Video file and select the transparent video animation file that you want to play on top of the current video before applying the cut transition effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/apply-cut-transition-effects.jpg"                      alt="apply cut transition effects"                ></p><p>Step5 For Transition Point Type, select Time(milliseconds) option. In the Transition Point field, add the duration of the transparent video animation so that the transition to the next scene takes place immediately after the video animation gets completed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-transition-point-field.jpg"                      alt="select transition point field"                ></p><p>Step6 If your video animation has audio, go to Audio Monitoring and select Monitor and Output option from the dropdown. For Audio Fade Style, you can select Crossfade option for better output.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/audio-monitor-output-obs.jpg"                      alt="audio monitor output obs"                ></p><p>Step7 Scroll down and click on Preview Transition button to check if the stinger transition is taking place as expected. You can adjust the transition point and other parameters to get it perfect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/preview-stinger-transition.jpg"                      alt="preview stinger transition"                ></p><p>Step8 Finally, click on Ok button and play the video to check out the stinger transition on the big screen.</p><p>The steps on how to add a custom transition to Streamlabs OBS are almost similar, and therefore, you can add stinger transition using Streamlabs comfortably.</p><h2 id="Part-3-OBS-Alternative-to-Add-Transitions"><a href="#Part-3-OBS-Alternative-to-Add-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

The best part is to know it is not just a video player. It is an editor; yes, you heard it right. VLC is the correct choice for splitting or cutting your videos without facing any difficulties.</p><p>The article is a guide about the split of the videos in VLC.

It is still on top of all the media players because of its simple interface. Below are the very easy steps to split the videos in the VLC media player.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> After completing the download, install the updated version of the VLC media player if it is not on your PC. Once it is installed, you need to double click on its icon for launching it.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> This step is the activation of the advanced controls in the media player. Click on “View” visible on the menu bar. Click on the “Advanced Controls” and appears the menu of four additional buttons more than the button for play or pause.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/split-clip-vlc-1.jpeg"                      alt="split clip in vlc"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, you can easily play the video simply by clicking the “Open File” option present in the media menu. The drag and drop option is available inside the VLC media player.</p><p>You should start playing the video now and recording the parts with the help of a decoder. Look for the position from where you want to begin the recording and press both Play and Pause buttons one after the other.</p><p>Even the Frame-by-Frame button is also available. It is the last one in the advance controls for navigating the actual frame from where you want to begin the recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/split-clip-vlc-2.jpeg"                      alt="split clip in vlc"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p><p>Press the button “Record” again whenever you want the recording to stop. This is the final step for cutting the videos in VLC. The split video from the actual video saves automatically as the MP4 video file in the folder of Libraries or Videos if you are using Windows operating system.</p><p>Almost all, playing any video and audio format is possible in VLC media player. It includes AVI, MP4, FLV, WMV, RMVB and Quick time. You can even play the videos partially or preview them even before completing the downloads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/split-clip-vlc-3.jpeg"                      alt="split clip in vlc"                ></p><h2 id="An-easier-way-to-split-the-video"><a href="#An-easier-way-to-split-the-video" class="headerlink" title="An easier way to split the video"></a>An easier way to split the video</h2><p>The whole process of splitting the video into a VLC media player is extremely easy for managing and handling without any requirement of technical knowledge. But unfortunately, you can apply the frame-by-frame technique on the short videos. Monitoring is essential during the split and looking at the complete process whenever the recording is in VLC.</p><p>This causes the loss of quality.

We call it motion blur. The idea with this transition is to cut and paste your shots together by whipping your camera at the end of your first shot and at the beginning of your second one. This effect depends on two aspects. The first is by the speedy motion of the object out of the frame, and the second is by the camera’s movement.</p><p><strong>Here is a stepwise guide for you to try</strong></p><ol><li>Plan your shots, where and in what direction you will make the whip.</li><li>Then take the first shot and whip the camera at the end of the shot in the direction the object is moving.</li><li>For the next shot, whip the camera into the action and complete the shot.</li><li>Import both shots in your editing tool and find the point of blur in both.</li><li>Cut and paste them to add a blurring effect to your video.</li></ol><p>You can whip your camera in any direction you want.

Anyone can do it, but before you get started, we will share some do’s and don’ts to help you get the best results.</p><p>In fact, there are many ways to set up a green screen, but the most cost-efficient way is with a green screen fabric. If you are using a green fabric as a DIY green screen, make sure you steam or iron it out, whether taping it to a wall or hanging it off the rack. Keep in mind the green screen should not leave any wrinkles.</p><p>It is because wrinkles will make lighting the green screen a nightmare, and uneven lighting will leave you with shadows and disappointing results. It would help if you also pulled the green screen tight to get a seamless background. The better you do with the setup, the easier it will be the key it out later</p><h2 id="Part-3-Lighting-a-Green-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Lighting-a-Green-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Lighting a Green Screen"></a>Part 3: Lighting a Green Screen</h2><p>It doesn’t matter how nice your green screen is. You won’t get good results if you don’t light it properly. When you light a green screen, be aware of these things.</p><ul><li>Make sure there are at least six feet of space between you and your green screen; therefore, you’re not casting a shadow that cannot be keyed out later.</li><li>Remember, any shadow on the green screen is bad. The lighting on the screen should be flat, even, and one-dimensional meaning. Please don’t place the screen leaning at an angle since they’ll make it harder to light evenly.</li><li>Do light yourself and your background separately. It will ensure your subject wouldn’t bleed into the green, which will create a halo around them.</li><li>After you key out the green screen and lighting, your subjects should emulate the lighting from your final footage. For example, if you know sunlight is coming from the left light, your subject is from the left direction as well.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148633/16836" target="_top" id="2148633">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148633" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148633/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Keying-out-your-green-screen"><a href="#Part-4-Keying-out-your-green-screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Many <strong>video silence removers</strong> are available, but first, learn how silence affects video content. Let’s explore some of how silence can damage the quality of video content:</p><h3 id="1-Loss-of-Interest"><a href="#1-Loss-of-Interest" class="headerlink" title="1. Loss of Interest"></a>1. Loss of Interest</h3><p>When viewers encounter long silent moments in a video, they lose interest. Silence fails to hold their attention and leaves them craving for something more stimulating. As a result, they may lose interest in the content and look for other videos. This is somewhat discouraging for a content creator. That’s why short and meaningful content is what the audience demand.</p><h3 id="2-Lack-of-Emotional-Connection"><a href="#2-Lack-of-Emotional-Connection" class="headerlink" title="2. Lack of Emotional Connection"></a>2. Lack of Emotional Connection</h3><p>Sound and audio play an essential role in creating an emotional connection with the audience. Silence, on the other hand, fails to start any emotional response. Without appropriate sound effects or dialogue, videos can feel empty and emotionless. The absence of audio elements also fails to establish a connection with the viewer.</p><h3 id="3-Breaks-the-Flow"><a href="#3-Breaks-the-Flow" class="headerlink" title="3. Breaks the Flow"></a>3. Breaks the Flow</h3><p>Silent moments in videos can disrupt the natural flow and rhythm of the content. Viewers expect a seamless progression from one scene to another. However, sudden silences in a video may create frustration for some individuals. It may also lead to a disjointed viewing experience for the viewer. Meanwhile, the audience sometimes couldn’t understand the intended message.</p><h3 id="4-Awkwardness-and-Uncomfortable-Silence"><a href="#4-Awkwardness-and-Uncomfortable-Silence" class="headerlink" title="4. Awkwardness and Uncomfortable Silence"></a>4. Awkwardness and Uncomfortable Silence</h3><p>Silence can create awkward moments in videos, especially when it’s unexpected or prolonged. These silent gaps can make viewers feel uncomfortable. The viewer becomes unsure of what to expect or how to interpret the situation. Moreover, awkward silences can detract from the overall viewing experience. It also leaves a negative impression and makes the content less enjoyable.</p><h3 id="5-Reduced-Engagement-and-Sharing"><a href="#5-Reduced-Engagement-and-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="5. Reduced Engagement and Sharing"></a>5. Reduced Engagement and Sharing</h3><p>Videos that contain excessive silence are less likely to be shared or discussed among viewers. Silent moments fail to generate excitement or spark conversations. In contrast, videos with dynamic audio elements are more likely to capture attention. If your video has long pauses or awkward silent moments, it may not get the expected response.</p><p><strong>Video Slience Detector</strong></p><p>Easily and precisely detect slience in video with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>!

Everybody has a smartphone, which is a capable video camera, in their pocket. In fact, the use of smartphones for mobile creation has increased to the point that some people consider it to be the main function and equally crucial to communication.</p><p>Pocket-lint has compiled ten ideas in an effort to assist you in getting whatever it is you want in the best possible way. Even if some of the advice may seem apparent, using it all should always produce fantastic videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/shoot-a-video-on-phone.jpg"                      alt="shoot a video on phone"                ></p><h2 id="1-Get-ready-for-filming"><a href="#1-Get-ready-for-filming" class="headerlink" title="1. Get ready for filming"></a>1. Get ready for filming</h2><p>Make sure that you have everything you need to start recording your videos, including the necessary</p><p>equipment, props, scripts, actors, and locations, before you start the recording process. In addition, ensure that your mobile device is of high quality and that it has a sufficient amount of storage space (available memory) to save the film. High definition (HD) video files can be quite large and storing them can quickly deplete a battery’s capacity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/get-ready-for-filming.jpg"                      alt="get ready for filming"                ></p><p>They add a great point; you need to think about stabilization, and they’ve included a few great options for</p><p>obtaining steady video. This video by Filmic Pro titled “5 Things to Do Before You Shoot iPhone Video” covers a lot of what we’ve discussed as well, including memory storage, battery life, audio, and resolution.</p><h2 id="2-Use-good-lighting"><a href="#2-Use-good-lighting" class="headerlink" title="2. Use good lighting"></a>2. Use good lighting</h2><p>Because smartphone cameras have smaller image sensors and lenses, proper illumination has a significant impact on their performance. As much as you can, try to film your video in well-lit environments. By doing this, you can reduce the amount of unwanted shadow and grain in your video. On the other hand, you also need to be cautious to avoid pointing the camera straight towards bright light sources because this will result in useless overexposed footage and lens flare. The lighting should be consistent and steady because most smartphone image sensors take a while to respond to abrupt changes in brightness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/use-good-lighting.jpg"                      alt="use good lighting"                ></p><p>If shooting your video in low light is still difficult, experiment with your phone’s or app’s backlighting and white balance settings. In case your camera is focusing on the incorrect part of your composition, most phones now provide “touch focusing.” The automatic exposure control will have an easier time making minor adjustments if the lighting condition changes once the focus has been placed on the most crucial part of the video.</p><h2 id="3-Film-horizontally-not-vertically"><a href="#3-Film-horizontally-not-vertically" class="headerlink" title="3. Film horizontally, not vertically"></a>3. Film horizontally, not vertically</h2><p>Your natural inclination may be to hold the smartphone in a vertical position when you are using it to record video, just as you do when you are using it for the vast majority of other purposes. However, if you want to edit your video and post it online and on social media, this may place certain restrictions on your ability to do so.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/film-horizontally-mobile-phone.jpg"                      alt="film horizontally mobile phone"                ></p><h2 id="4-Make-sure-to-have-good-audio"><a href="#4-Make-sure-to-have-good-audio" class="headerlink" title="4. Make sure to have good audio"></a>4. Make sure to have good audio</h2><p>We’re going to go ahead and say that sound is one of the most essential components of any video. The difficulty is in the fact that the audio quality on your smartphone is not always of the highest caliber. When it comes to audio, there is a general rule that the smartphone should be as close to the speaker as is physically possible in order to obtain the clearest sound possible from it. Even if you are only a few meters away from the person whose voice you want to record on your smartphone, you won’t be able to get a good recording of them.</p><p>This is not the fault of your smartphone; rather, smartphones are intended to be used by speaking into them at close range; hence, you should think about employing the use of an external microphone in order to improve the sound quality. However, if you are unable to do so, there is no need for concern because you can use an additional smartphone in its place.</p><p>You can record audio on your mobile device by opening the voice memo app and selecting the record button. Your audio will immediately be improved if you position the phone’s microphone such that it is facing your topic and is somewhat close to them. Clap once at the beginning of the recording to serve as a reference point for both the video and the audio, which will help you save time while editing. After that, it will be simple for you to locate the point at which the clap occurred and synchronize the high-quality audio that is on the memo with the audio that is in your film.</p><h2 id="5-Edit-your-video"><a href="#5-Edit-your-video" class="headerlink" title="5. Edit your video"></a>5. Edit your video</h2><p>Now that you’ve gathered all of your film, it’s time to cut it up, add some color, and get creative with effects! Fortunately, there are numerous video editing apps available that make it easier and faster than ever to use. You can edit videos on your phone just as you would on a computer using apps like Adobe Rush and iMovie, and it’s easier than you think.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/edit-video-on-mobile-phone.jpg"                      alt="edit video on mobile phone"                ></p><p>You’ve probably heard of iMovie, Apple’s free video editing software that works on both your iPhone and Mac. You can add titles, music, and additional effects to your video clips, much like in Adobe Rush. iMovie is really easy to use, especially if you’re new to editing. The main distinction between Adobe Rush and iMovie is that Adobe Rush includes more professional and technical changes, whilst iMovie has a considerably larger selection of video effects and transitions.</p><p>Adobe Rush is the most user-friendly app for editing and creating high-quality films on your smartphone. One of Adobe Rush’s best features is the ability to incorporate motion graphics, video effects, text, and mix audio. If you prefer a larger screen to edit on, Adobe Rush seamlessly transfers the files to your computer, allowing you to resume editing where you left off on your smartphone. This program is simple to use, and there are numerous guidelines and tutorials available online to help you get started.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135315/14409" target="_top" id="2135315">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2135315" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135315/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-6"><a href="#Conclusion-6" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>You probably weren’t aware of this, but your smartphone is actually a very capable piece of equipment that can be used to record videos of a high quality.

You can use to create or remove a video’s background. Advanced Chroma Key features such as Color Key and Ultra Key make it possible to produce background-free content quickly.</p><p>Although both Keys work similarly, many users prefer to use the Ultra key for a better result in the video. This article will explain how to remove video background in Premiere Pro if you are a newbie.</p><p>Let’s get right to it and start the tutorial!</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Premiere-Pro-to-Remove-Video-Background"><a href="#How-to-Use-Premiere-Pro-to-Remove-Video-Background" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Premiere Pro to Remove Video Background?"></a>How to Use Premiere Pro to Remove Video Background?</h2><p>Adobe Premiere Pro can remove video backgrounds quickly using the <strong>Ultra Key</strong> feature with the following steps:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, launch a browser, and download the appropriate Adobe Premiere Pro version for your <a class="link"   href="https://adobe-premiere.en.softonic.com/" >Windows PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://filehippo.com/mac/download%5Fadobe-premiere-pro-cc-for-mac/" >Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Next, install the software on your system and launch it from your Desktop or Dock.</p><p>Step2 Now, use the <strong>Media Browser panel</strong> in the software to browse the video clips you want to import into the software. Next, right-click on your selected video file in which you want to remove the background and choose the <strong>“Import”</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/premiere-pro-media-browser.png"                      alt="premiere pro media browser"                ></p><p>Step3 Click the <strong>“Effects”</strong> tab in the software panel and select Video Effects. Here, you will see the <strong>“Keying”</strong> option; select the <strong>Ultra Key</strong>, press and hold it to grab the key, and place it on your video clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/premiere-pro-ultra-key.png"                      alt="premiere pro ultra key"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also search for the Ultra Key in the Adobe Premiere Pro search bar. Drag it to the video clip containing a background you want to remove.</p><p>Step4 As soon as you drop the Ultra Key to your footage, an <strong>Effects Control panel</strong> will pop up. Next, use the <strong>eyedropper tool</strong> in the Effects Control panel. Finally, select the background color on your video that you want to remove.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/premiere-pro-effects-control-panel.png"                      alt="premiere pro effects control panel"                ></p><p>Step5 In the next step, click the drop-down menu next to the <strong>“Output”</strong> option, and select <strong>“Alpha Channel”</strong> from the list. This will reveal the details of your video and the edits. Also, click the “<strong>Setting”</strong> drop-down menu and select the Relaxed, Aggressive, or Custom option for the video effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/premiere-pro-output-and-setting.png"                      alt="premiere pro output and setting&lt;"                ></p><p>Step6 Select the “<strong>Matte Generation</strong>“ below Key Color.

To master color grading, you must practice constantly, one of the reasons for the existence of specialists in this field. While everybody can color grade, not everyone can do it well. People in this business have devised remedies to make the editing workflow considerably more accessible and less time-consuming.</p><p>Achieving a specific ambiance in a scene demands ongoing effort and naturally takes longer. LUTs, or Lookup Tables, were created as a result. LUTs are ideal for storing a set of colors to use later or in another program. A LUT is the most effective technique to color or alters your image’s colors.</p><h2 id="Benefits-of-using-LUTs"><a href="#Benefits-of-using-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of using LUTs"></a>Benefits of using LUTs</h2><p>There are numerous advantages to using lookup tables to edit your footage. We’ve already discussed that it helps to give your films a more polished and professional appearance, which is one of the primary explanations why individuals use LUTs, but there are many more.</p><h3 id="1-A-beginning-towards-professionalism"><a href="#1-A-beginning-towards-professionalism" class="headerlink" title="1.

A beginning towards professionalism</h3><p>This is a fantastic approach for beginners to have a good idea of how to build their own trademark looks in their videos. The time it takes to develop your color grading craft is unavoidable. So, as a novice, LUTs will come in useful for you to establish your approach and save your ass, big time.</p><p>You’ll eventually come up with a blend of your own LUTs to use, resulting in your own LUT. Not only will LUTs aid in color grading learning, but they will also save funds and resources. You will not only devote time to learning color grading, but you will also spend a significant amount of money on color grading tools and equipment, such as software and color panels. You’ll see why color grading equipment is necessary when you get to this point.</p><p>However, for the time being, employing LUTs is the most cost-effective way to obtain a cinematic look.</p><h3 id="2-It-saves-your-time"><a href="#2-It-saves-your-time" class="headerlink" title="2.

Having a trustworthy LUT to use for video will save the life of freelance editors who are constantly meeting commitments and modifications. Isn’t the purpose of color grading to generate a visual emotion for your movie? So, with LUTs, you can create one without going through the time-consuming process of manual color correction. Only one-color preset will be applied to all scenes in a single LUT.</p><p>However, there’s a good probability that it won’t look the same in all of the images. This is where you’ll adjust the colors to make them more evenly match the film. It’s nothing significant most of the time, just some little saturation adjustments, etc.</p><h3 id="3-Work-on-a-budget"><a href="#3-Work-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="3. Work on a budget"></a>3. Work on a budget</h3><p>Time spent in a color-grade suite may be highly costly, and it can lead your films to go over budget in order to achieve a specific aesthetic. LUTs, on the other hand, are available for free online or for a fee for more complex versions. Even if you buy your LUTs, you could save thousands of dollars based on the size of your film. LUTs can also assist you in meeting tight deadlines, and setting targets too optimistically is something I’m sure we’ve all done at some point.</p><p>Whether it’s a client or a personal project, things can often get pushed to the last minute, so having something in your arsenal that can save you time is always a good bonus. There are, however, projects where you need to appear competent without investing a lot of time on them due to budget limits; this is where a lookup table comes in handy because you can modify the complete style of your movie in a matter of seconds by pressing a few buttons. Even complicated editing can be completed quickly, giving you more time to work on other tasks that will earn you more money.</p><h3 id="4-It-provides-an-artistic-approach"><a href="#4-It-provides-an-artistic-approach" class="headerlink" title="4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-Can-I-Control-Speed-of-a-Video"><a href="#How-Can-I-Control-Speed-of-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="How Can I Control Speed of a Video"></a>How Can I Control Speed of a Video</h2><p>Speed doesn’t course at the same level for everyone. You can change momentum. You can slow it down and speed it up to convey a particular mood. In this article, you will learn how and when to control the speed of the video and its importance.</p><h2 id="Importance-of-Speeding-up-Slowing-Down-Your-video"><a href="#Importance-of-Speeding-up-Slowing-Down-Your-video" class="headerlink" title="Importance of Speeding up&#x2F;Slowing Down Your video?"></a>Importance of Speeding up&#x2F;Slowing Down Your video?</h2><p>Speeding up or slowing it down, known as slow or fast motion, can make your video faster or slower than its actual speed, called speed ramping. Overall, adjusting the speed of video clips can enhance the video’s visual effects, especially if you want to convey a particular mood to the audience. Speeding up your video may create a comical and dramatic impact, while slowing down your video can give viewers a time-lapse feel or an emotional mood.</p><p>This video speed controlling software can instantly speed up video up to 50x times. On the contrary, you can also slow down the video up to 0.1x, which means a one-minute video will run for 10 minutes.</p><p>How important is this Feature? The technique plays an essential role in adjusting the video’s speed. You will appreciate this technique once you’ve started editing your video. At first, controlling the speed of your video without music will give you a plain or bare impression. Based on my experience, I cannot quickly identify which video part needs to control the speed. Still, once you’ve added music at the start, you can quickly determine when and where you should maintain the momentum based on the beat of the music.</p><h2 id="How-to-Speed-up-Slow-down-a-Video"><a href="#How-to-Speed-up-Slow-down-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Speed up&#x2F;Slow down a Video?"></a>How to Speed up&#x2F;Slow down a Video?</h2><p>Nowadays, most video editing software offers an effortless way of giving special cinematic effects through speed ramping? Speed ramping is an approach to adjusting the clip’s speed to send the message across and provide the audience with an element of confusion. Since speed ramp is a gradual increase in the acceleration or deceleration of a video clip, reasons to slow down or speed up video vary from merely decorative to practical, but whatever your reasons, speed effects can add some production value to your projects.</p><p>This article gives you a guide on how to slow down or speed up video on your video editing software, for example, using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your device.</p><p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to change the speed of your video using Wondershare Filmora</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h5 id="Step1-Open-your-Video-editing-software"><a href="#Step1-Open-your-Video-editing-software" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Open your Video editing software"></a>Step1 Open your Video editing software</h5><p>Launch Wondershare Filmora from your system and select New Project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-01.png"                      alt="launch wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>Import the selected videos and open them in the program to enhance the speed and duration of the video.

All the developers have focused themselves on speed and also performance. The team at Adobe have worked very hard to make this application more responsive and when we go along in this article, that can be seen in many ways</p><p>The main improvement which is immediately clear to all users, is the renewed preview playback optimization. What we noticed is that After Effects is creating the ram preview for your projects a lot faster. However, while working with the software for this article, we did find the user interface to be more responsive, the playback is way smoother, so is it a lot more stable overall.</p><p>While using shape layers, there was a significant improvement.

Motion Graphics"></a>5. Motion Graphics</h2><p>Motion graphics can sound quite scary. It’s a new term for a specific genre of animation. Motion graphics is the intersection between animation and graphic design. These are purpose-driven visual aspects with the goal of showing information to the viewer through the use of animated graphics or text. Sometimes they include voice-overs narrating what the text or graphics are showing. Where it gets a little complex is that the more popular the term motion graphics becomes, the more people are misaligning animations to it. They need to represent information and illustrate the idea to the viewer clearly, so they do that using animation and motion graphics.</p><h2 id="6-Titles-and-Outros"><a href="#6-Titles-and-Outros" class="headerlink" title="6. Titles and Outros"></a>6. Titles and Outros</h2><p>Adobe released a new combination of features for you. For Adobe Stock: Graphics templates. Those pre-made templates give you a super smooth way to discover new motion graphics within Premiere Pro, without needing to spend time creating titles, overlays, or animations from scratch. The world has digitalized, and videos often need visual aspects such as titles, lower thirds, to present information. The templates not only assist video editors increase the quality of the content by showing certain information, but they also give a strong visual touch to keep the viewer engaged throughout the video. The audience nowadays is a lot more sophisticated, meaning that motion graphics are a necessity in a driven media world.</p><p>Motion Graphics templates are valuable for video editors of all levels. For the beginning content creators, the templates offer great quality, ready-made footage to help their creative goal. They can explore and work on their skills. Motion graphics that are pre-made are an excellent way to express the vision and express inspiration to new opportunities.</p><p>So now that you are aware of what After Effects templates are, we can move on to the actual workflow, why it is important, and how to use it as efficient as possible.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657395/16446" target="_top" id="1657395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657395/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Workflow"><a href="#7-Workflow" class="headerlink" title="7.

Workflow</h2><p>Whether you are using Adobe After Effects to create motion graphics, or composite realistic visuals, you usually follow the same workflow, you may repeat the process of adjusting layer properties, editing, and compositing until everything looks good. You can change any property of any element, such as position, opacity and size. Make use of motion tracking to stabilize footage so that it follows the motion from another clip, and so much more!</p><h2 id="8-Rendering-Speed"><a href="#8-Rendering-Speed" class="headerlink" title="8. Rendering Speed"></a>8. Rendering Speed</h2><p>When it comes to exporting your project in After Effects, you don’t need to buy an expensive workstation. You can speed up your rendering process from your own laptop without investing too much and by using the following tips we have for you below!</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Enable-Multiprocessing"><a href="#Tip-1-Enable-Multiprocessing" class="headerlink" title="Tip #1: Enable Multiprocessing"></a>Tip #1: Enable Multiprocessing</h3><p>What exactly is multiprocessing? That is when After Effects uses multiple cores from your CPU to export multiple frames at once. If your processor has one or more cores, you can enable this feature to reduce your rendering time. We want to mention that you need to check whether or not this option is turned on. Once enabled, you’ll see a great decrease in export time.</p><p>To enable Multiprocessing, navigate to Preferences &gt; Memory &amp; Multiprocessing. Then you click the check box next to ‘Render Multiple Frames Simultaneously’ and remember also to adjust the settings that you need.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Optimize-Your-RAM-Usage"><a href="#Tip-2-Optimize-Your-RAM-Usage" class="headerlink" title="Tip #2: Optimize Your RAM Usage"></a>Tip #2: Optimize Your RAM Usage</h3><p>The RAM memory inside your workstation can be used to write and read data at a lot higher speeds than regular hard drives and portable drives. Configuring your RAM in a system is one of the easiest upgrades for better performance. Giving you affordable solutions for both desktop and laptop systems, the RAM memory upgrade does not require a lot of knowledge. The more RAM you allow applications to use, the higher the performance you will get out of it.</p><p>It also shows a noticeable increase in rendering speed. When the export time in your work is longer than needed, look at your RAM memory and see if you can make the necessary changes or upgrades.</p><h3 id="Tip-3-Use-the-Media-Encoder"><a href="#Tip-3-Use-the-Media-Encoder" class="headerlink" title="Tip #3: Use the Media Encoder"></a>Tip #3: Use the Media Encoder</h3><p>Let’s talk about the Media Encoder. It’s the software that comes up with Adobe Creative Cloud products such as After Effects and Premiere Pro to simplify the export process. You can easily render your project from After Effects to Adobe Media Encoder and begin the project render process from that point on. The Media Encoder will increase your rendering performance and will significantly decrease rendering time.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Disable-Ray-Traced-3D"><a href="#Tip-4-Disable-Ray-Traced-3D" class="headerlink" title="Tip #4: Disable Ray-Traced 3D"></a>Tip #4: Disable Ray-Traced 3D</h3><p>The included After Effects Ray-Traced 3D feature enables you to produce 3D models within After Effects without any struggle. Calculating all the motions and visual graphics is such a heavy process for your workstation. When you disable raytracing, you will get a faster export time. By looking that ‘Classic 3D’ is checked instead of ‘Ray-Traced 3D’ from your composition preferences, you can speed your rendering speed up to 50%. Isn’t that incredible?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adobe-after-effects-review-03.jpg"                      alt="disable ray traced 3d"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-5-Activate-GPU-Exporting-with-Cuda-Acceleration"><a href="#Tip-5-Activate-GPU-Exporting-with-Cuda-Acceleration" class="headerlink" title="Tip #5: Activate GPU Exporting with Cuda Acceleration"></a>Tip #5: Activate GPU Exporting with Cuda Acceleration</h3><p>Exporting your videos with GPU rather than CPU will increase the efficiency of your render process. The export length will decrease a whole lot when you activate Mercury GPU Acceleration, also known as ‘CUDA’ from the ‘Project Settings’.</p><p>After Effects doesn’t really require CUDA features from a special kind of Nvidia GPU. Only the GPU accelerated 3D renderer, that is based on the raytracing algorithm, requires that. The other GPU features are running on any GPU that meets the basic minimums, including Intel and AMD GPUs.</p><h2 id="9-System-Requirements-for-Windows"><a href="#9-System-Requirements-for-Windows" class="headerlink" title="9.

Should You Buy It?"></a>12. Should You Buy It?</h2><p>Well first, you cannot buy After Effects, Premiere Pro or other software from Adobe. You have to rent them by paying monthly. After Effects is primarily a compositing and graphics software. Premiere is primarily a video editing program. In the case of After Effects and Premiere Pro, it’s not really an either&#x2F;or. They’re both software with different purposes. After Effects is a lot more powerful and essentially showcases most of Premiere’s functionality, but according to our experience, the Premiere Pro interface and workflow is way more superior for video editing.</p><p>Premiere Pro is essentially built around its timeline, the region where you cut your video clips and drag and place them into your appropriate sequence. Hollywood filmmakers and professional YouTube content creators are using Premiere Pro to edit high-performing content and award-winning films. The software is very intuitive and easy for beginners to start with.</p><p>Are going to work with After Effects to create an income? Or are just going to use it for a hobby? It’s crucial to mention that question because Adobe After Effects is not something that is cheaply available. You will be investing much money on the program, and if you are working to use the software, paying a good amount, and earning nothing in return, then you might want to shift to another alternative which would cost you less. For instance, let’s assume you are using the application to earn an income, and have a few low-paying clients. In such a situation, you will have to rethink your options of software and analyze whether what you are paying in comparison to what you are getting is enough for you or not. We all are different individuals and have different preferences. Once we can see what is more important to us, or what is our need at this moment, then we will be able to judge the worth of purchasing Adobe After Effects better.</p><p>Are you going to use After Effects to earn an income? Or are just using it as a hobby? It is very important to address this question because Adobe After Effects is not something cheaply accessible. You will be investing a lot of money into this software, if you are using the software while paying a good amount and earning nothing in return yet, then you could shift to a different alternative which will cost you a lot less. Let’s say you are using After Effects to earn an income and have some low-paying work. In that case, you will have to reconsider your options of video editing software and look at whether what you are paying in comparison to what you are getting is possible for you. When we can see what is more important to us, we will be able to see the worth of buying After Effects.</p><p>Did you previously use After Effects or are you new to the program? The return that you will get using Adobe After Effects, depends on how good you know how to work with the options, functions and features in the software.</p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>So summing it all together, Adobe After Effects takes care of all your assets and creates a final product, considering that After Effects is usually an asset-generation tool. Most video editors complete their projects in After Effects non-stop. It’s excellent for making visual videos come to life.</p><p>AE version 22.3 is very impressive. Giving you a wealth of new features created to make VFX editing a lot faster and easier. Offering new features on a regular basis, improving their subscription model making it more attractive. Especially if you’re a professional editor and designer.</p><p>Once you get comfortable with Adobe After Effects, you learn how to dynamically combine After Effects compositions to your Premiere projects.

You can exchange thoughts, interact with them right away. You can also enhance your speaking skills in front of the camera. A very much needed ability if you want to be a YouTuber like us.</li><li>If you’re a newbie in vlogging, YouTube set its requirements for you to be their YouTube Partner; which includes 1000 subscribers and 4000 watch hours (240,000 minutes). So, if you want to get pass above it as fast as you could, YouTube livestreaming could be the best key to achieve it. Imagine you’re going to be on live for about 3 hours in a row, so that’s 180 minutes already.</li></ol><p>To sum it up, if you’re someone who wants to share your ability to the virtual world out there; then YouTube platform can be one of your go-to-stage. You can also choose Facebook if you want to target large audiences. Although YouTube is the second largest search engine next to Google, I think Facebook are a way ahead when it comes to reaching potential viewers or audiences because Facebook statistics show that more than two billion users have an account, 65 million businesses have Facebook pages and advertisers are crazy about it. Most of our friends and relatives are on Facebook. And that’s freaking insane. So, what are you waiting for, choose your social platform and GO ON LIVE!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-perfect-your-subtitle-skills-with-this-complete-guide-and-tips/"><u>[New] Perfect Your Subtitle Skills with This Complete Guide & Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-top-7-free-dvd-player-software-for-windowsmacphone/"><u>[New] Top 7 Free DVD Player Software for Windows/Mac/Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-figure-skatings-top-talent-review-of-22-moments/"><u>[Updated] Figure Skating's Top Talent Review of '22 Moments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-ultimate-ai-powered-image-editor/"><u>2024 Approved Ultimate AI-Powered Image Editor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/1725285337189-macdvd/"><u>初心者におすすめ!MacでDVDをクローンする簡単な方法：標準ツールと特化型ソフトウェア</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/how-to-record-video-streams-with-ffmpeg-on-windows-and-mac/"><u>How to Record Video Streams With FFmpeg on Windows and Mac?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-repair-apple-iphone-6-plus-ios-system-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How To Repair Apple iPhone 6 Plus iOS System? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/in-2024-have-you-ever-tried-using-the-premiere-pro-motion-blur-plugin-read-this-article-to-learn-how-to-efficiently-use-the-reelsmart-motion-blur-plugin-in-/"><u>In 2024, Have You Ever Tried Using the Premiere Pro Motion Blur Plugin?

A raw video footage is never appealing to the eyes because of sudden cuts, unnecessary parts, and lack of eye-catching effects. That is why video editing is crucial for turning an unappealing raw video into an attention-grabbing video. As a matter of fact, the way you edit your video makes your video stand out when you are posting on social media platforms.</p><p>One of the most important aspects of video editing is adding transitions to video clips. When you jump from one scene to another and make sudden cuts, you need to apply some video transitions so that the move from one scene to another becomes soothing to the eyes. Different video editors have different transition effects and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has the best collection of transitions.

What is a Video transition effect?"></a>Part 1. What is a Video transition effect?</h2><p>A video transition effect is the most commonly used graphical effect in video editing. A video transition effect is essential whereby you connect one shot to another, especially when you are making sudden cuts in the video. Therefore, a video transition effect sits in between two shots and connects them together smoothly so that it does not look odd to the eyes. Video editing with transitions is a common practice for short videos on social media, presentation videos, and even movies.</p><p>A video transition effect is effective when you are jumping from two moods and emotions in the video. It is equally useful while jumping between storylines, points of view, and timelines. Besides, you can spice up your narrative and make your video eye-catching as well as eye-soothing. There are different types of video transition effects such as fade in and out, zoom in and out, dissolve, wipe and pan.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-add-transitions-in-video"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-add-transitions-in-video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

You should choose a video editor that has a wide collection of transition effects so that you can apply them to your video as per your preference.

Video transitions tips and tricks"></a>Part 3. Video transitions tips and tricks</h2><p>If you want to make your video stand out by simply using video transition effects, you have to follow the following tips and tricks.</p><p><strong>Consistency</strong> – Amateur video editors tend to use several extravagant transitions in one video that distract and even annoy the audience. You are using video transition effects not to distract but to smoothen the video content. Therefore, you need to be consistent with the video transition effect you use. You should use one or maximum of two transition effects throughout the video so that the audience does not get distracted.</p><p><strong>Experiment</strong> – While it is true that you should not be using too many video transitions in one video, but you should definitely apply different video transition effects in different videos initially. This will help you to understand which transition is getting better traction, and thereafter, you can stick to it for the rest of your videos. This is particularly useful when you are making similar type of content for social media and video streaming sites.</p><p><strong>Out of the Box</strong> – The reason you recommended <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is that there is a huge collection of different types of transition effects. If you use the regular transitions such as fade, zoom, wipe, and dissolve, you cannot create an impression among your viewers. You have to use out of the box transitions so that your video can look and feel different even when you content is not. There are 3D effects, social media effects, and different genres of effects that can go well with your video content.</p><p><strong>Judicious</strong> – There is a difference between transition effects and video effects. Transition effects should last only for a fraction of a second so that there is no aftereffect in mind. On the contrary, a video effect can last as long as required in the video.

Video transitions tips and tricks"></a>Part 3. Video transitions tips and tricks</h2><p>If you want to make your video stand out by simply using video transition effects, you have to follow the following tips and tricks.</p><p><strong>Consistency</strong> – Amateur video editors tend to use several extravagant transitions in one video that distract and even annoy the audience. You are using video transition effects not to distract but to smoothen the video content. Therefore, you need to be consistent with the video transition effect you use. You should use one or maximum of two transition effects throughout the video so that the audience does not get distracted.</p><p><strong>Experiment</strong> – While it is true that you should not be using too many video transitions in one video, but you should definitely apply different video transition effects in different videos initially. This will help you to understand which transition is getting better traction, and thereafter, you can stick to it for the rest of your videos. This is particularly useful when you are making similar type of content for social media and video streaming sites.</p><p><strong>Out of the Box</strong> – The reason you recommended <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is that there is a huge collection of different types of transition effects. If you use the regular transitions such as fade, zoom, wipe, and dissolve, you cannot create an impression among your viewers. You have to use out of the box transitions so that your video can look and feel different even when you content is not. There are 3D effects, social media effects, and different genres of effects that can go well with your video content.</p><p><strong>Judicious</strong> – There is a difference between transition effects and video effects. Transition effects should last only for a fraction of a second so that there is no aftereffect in mind. On the contrary, a video effect can last as long as required in the video. Therefore, do not stretch the duration of a transition effect and keep it as short as possible. Similarly, you should not use transition effects here and there unnecessarily. It should be used only when there is a proper scope such as scene cuts, mood changes, and subject changes.</p><p><strong>Meaningful</strong> – Even transition effect has a meaning behind it and you should understand it and use wherever appropriate. For example, fade out effect signifies the fading of a scene or changing of mood. Similarly, a dissolve effect is appropriate when the subject is dissolved in certain thoughts or a scene is getting dissolved. That way the effect will look natural and more meaningful as well as impactful.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-1"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-1" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Video transition effects are essential in almost all types of videos.

Let’s Get Started</h2><p>Masking is a video effect that allows you to cut out a scene and use the overlay to duplicate, hide, modify, or reveal your video footage. Just think of it as cutting something on your video so you can see what’s in the bottom layer. So, without wasting time, let me show you how to mask a video in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

To do that, find a doorway with enough space to walk back and forth before setting up a camera with a tripod facing the entrance. Make sure you set the camera at the center height of the door to prevent lens distortion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/place-the-camera-facing-the-door.gif"                      alt="place the camera facing the door"                ></p><p>With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let’s get editing with Wondershare Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/walk-backwards.gif"                      alt="walk backwards"                ></p><p>Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-1.jpg"                      alt="fire up wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-2.jpg"                      alt="proceed to hide the first track"                ></p><p>Step 3 Next, click the <strong>Effect</strong> button and find the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect in the <strong>Utility</strong> folder. Now drag the effect to the top layer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-3.jpg"                      alt="click the effect button"                ></p><p>Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking <strong>Ok</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-4.jpg"                      alt="double-click the clip"                ></p><p>Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-5.jpg"                      alt="unhide the first track"                ></p><h3 id="Masking-Trick-2"><a href="#Masking-Trick-2" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick: 2"></a><em>Masking Trick: 2</em></h3><p>In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/tree-with-clear-background.gif"                      alt="create a subject walking in and outside a tree"                ></p><p>Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they’ll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That’s all!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/walk-away-from-the-tree.gif"                      alt="film the subject walking from one side of the tree"                ></p><p>Step 1 Import the clip on Filmora, then add the footage on the first and second timelines. After that, hide the first track, then find the scene where the subject walks forward away from the tree in the second track. Cut off the area before that action.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-6.jpg"                      alt="import the clip on filmora"                ></p><p>Step 2 Next, click <strong>Effects</strong>, choose <strong>Utility</strong>, then drag the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select <strong>Video Effects</strong>, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.</p><p>Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip’s timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-7.jpg"                      alt="adjust the mask"                ></p><p>Step 3 Play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-8.jpg"                      alt="play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938677/19272" target="_top" id="1938677">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938677" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938677/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Masking-Trick-3"><a href="#Masking-Trick-3" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 3:"></a><em>Masking Trick 3:</em></h3><p>For this masking illusion, we’ll create a video with a subject jumping over a house. So, set up your camera tripod on a low level in front of the building.

To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-2.jpg"                      alt="proceed to hide the first track"                ></p><p>Step 3 Next, click the <strong>Effect</strong> button and find the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect in the <strong>Utility</strong> folder.

After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-9.jpg"                      alt="import the clip into filmora"                ></p><p>Step 2 Now, it’s time to customize the clip with a mask. To do that, head to the <strong>Utility</strong> folder under <strong>Effects</strong> and choose <strong>Image Mask</strong>. Click the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> box to invert the mask.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-10.jpg"                      alt="customize the clip with a mask"                ></p><p>Step 3 Double-click the video track and choose an image mask under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Note that you may need several combinations of masks to mask out the sky and leave the building. So, play around with different masking shapes until the sky is covered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-11.jpg"                      alt="double-click the video track"                ></p><p>Step 4 After masking, unhide the first track on the timeline before playing the video to find the scene where the subject appears and cut off everything before that scene. Also, find the scene where the subject jumps in the air and cut the clip in the second track. Then, delete everything after that scene.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-12.jpg"                      alt="unhide the first track on the timeline"                ></p><p>Step 5 Play the video to see your subject jumping over the building and walking away from the scene.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-13.jpg"                      alt="play the video to see your subject"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>That was easy, right? Playing around with Filmora’s masking tools can create incredible masking illusions like the ones we’ve discussed. And don’t forget this video editor has many more creative possibilities. You should try these masking tricks!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h3 id="Masking-Trick-1-3"><a href="#Masking-Trick-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 1:"></a><em>Masking Trick 1:</em></h3><p>First, you need to shoot footage to add the masking effect. To do that, find a doorway with enough space to walk back and forth before setting up a camera with a tripod facing the entrance. Make sure you set the camera at the center height of the door to prevent lens distortion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/place-the-camera-facing-the-door.gif"                      alt="place the camera facing the door"                ></p><p>With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let’s get editing with Wondershare Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/walk-backwards.gif"                      alt="walk backwards"                ></p><p>Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-1.jpg"                      alt="fire up wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-2.jpg"                      alt="proceed to hide the first track"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105877/7443" target="_top" id="2105877">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105877" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105877/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 3 Next, click the <strong>Effect</strong> button and find the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect in the <strong>Utility</strong> folder.

On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-5.jpg"                      alt="unhide the first track"                ></p><h3 id="Masking-Trick-2-3"><a href="#Masking-Trick-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick: 2"></a><em>Masking Trick: 2</em></h3><p>In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/tree-with-clear-background.gif"                      alt="create a subject walking in and outside a tree"                ></p><p>Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back.

Cut off the area before that action.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-6.jpg"                      alt="import the clip on filmora"                ></p><p>Step 2 Next, click <strong>Effects</strong>, choose <strong>Utility</strong>, then drag the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select <strong>Video Effects</strong>, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.</p><p>Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip’s timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-7.jpg"                      alt="adjust the mask"                ></p><p>Step 3 Play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-8.jpg"                      alt="play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree"                ></p><h3 id="Masking-Trick-3-3"><a href="#Masking-Trick-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 3:"></a><em>Masking Trick 3:</em></h3><p>For this masking illusion, we’ll create a video with a subject jumping over a house.

Whether it was in a blog post, a how-to guide, or on your preferred social media platform. Each of us has seen at least one image of one of them. However, what makes a difference? You’re about to learn in this article!</p><p>With that said, let’s begin!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-timelapse-and-how-is-it-used"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-timelapse-and-how-is-it-used" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is a timelapse, and how is it used?"></a>Part 1. What is a timelapse, and how is it used?</h2><p>Timelapses are familiar to you, whether they were used in a series to demonstrate a swift change from night today or at the beginning of your favorite influencer’s vlog. But exactly what is it? The term “timelapse” refers to a photography method in which static images are stitched together to produce a time-warping video. When the video is played, the time seems to pass more quickly, creating the illusion that time is slipping away.</p><p>Put your camera in a fixed position, stop it from moving, panning, or tilting, then record for a long time to make your own timelapse. This period of time could last for five minutes, an hour, days, or even years. Once the film is gathered, all that’s left to do is speed everything up.</p><p>The fact that time-lapses make for a pleasant visual effect is what makes them so popular in Vlogs and other media. This method enables you to describe the passage of time, the movement of individuals through space, etc. utilizes time-lapse.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/car-light-timelapse-video.jpg"                      alt="car light timelapse video"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-a-hyperlapse"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-a-hyperlapse" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What is a hyperlapse?"></a>Part 2. What is a hyperlapse?</h2><p>On the other side, there are these things that we refer to as hyperlapses. In the subgenre of time-lapse photography known as cinematography, a hyperlapse is a filmmaking method used to generate motion shots by capturing movies rather than taking images. In order to create a hyperlapse, the camera does not remain stationary; rather, it follows the subject around and is typically held by the photographer.</p><p>The amount of time that elapses between pictures in a stop-motion video typically ranges from tenths of a second up to a few fractions of a second, although this can change significantly depending on what you want to show. However, after you have picked it, it must remain consistent in the same way that the timelapse does.</p><p>The attractive 3D look that hyperlapse produces is the primary draw for its utilization. The hyperlapse that is formed can produce a dreamy image, regardless of whether the camera is attached to a moving vehicle or is mounted on a tripod that is moving towards its target.</p><p>Additionally, you may use this approach to make stunning photographs with motion blur by employing long exposures. In most cases, the final image will be stabilized in post-production in order to eliminate some of the flaws that may have been captured in the original photo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/hyperlapse-sky-video.jpg"                      alt="hyperlapse sky video"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-What-differentiates-them-from-each-other"><a href="#Part-3-What-differentiates-them-from-each-other" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What differentiates them from each other?"></a>Part 3. What differentiates them from each other?</h2><p>The movement of the camera is what differentiates these two approaches the most from one another. When capturing a time lapse, the camera is kept relatively still and in the same position throughout. In addition, when you use a hyperlapse, the camera is continuously moving, which creates a 3D appearance in the image.</p><p>You could be scratching your head right about now, wondering when you should employ one of the two methods. If your subject is moving, you should take a time-lapse photograph; if the camera is moving, you should take a hyperlapse photograph. This question has a relatively straightforward answer.</p><p>The act of recording video for a hyperlapse can cause your storage to be filled up really rapidly. Therefore, you may wish to swap between the two methods depending on the length of time that you want to shoot for. If you are going to be filming for a significant amount of time, you should consider using a timelapse.</p><p>It is simple to determine the timelapse interval if you already know these answers. Choose the video’s final frame rate. It may be 24, 25, or 30 fps. You shouldn’t select more quickly. Choose the option that best fits your audience and location. Additionally, a time-lapse calculator is available.</p><p>The shoot time should then be converted to seconds. For instance, two hours are equal to 2 x 60 x 60 seconds, or 7200 seconds. Determine how many frames are required for your chosen timelapse now. For instance, the final product should be 30 seconds of 25fps video. You’ll need to capture 750 frames in total because 30 x 25 is 750.</p><p>Divide the time (7200s in this case) by the number of frames to obtain the interval (750). You can round up the result, which is 9.6, which is pretty near to 10 seconds. Therefore, in our case, your interval should be set to 10s.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Motion-control-timelapse"><a href="#Part-4-Motion-control-timelapse" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Motion control timelapse"></a>Part 4. Motion control timelapse</h2><p>Now that we understand how the timelapse images that are static are created, we are able to incorporate some movement into the shots that are static. Moving the camera around during a timelapse is much more difficult than it appears to be in the video. Every movement of the camera is slowed down when using slow motion, which means that you can make even a shaky handheld movie look good when using slow motion. The situation is completely reversed while viewing a timelapse.</p><p>Because every movement of the camera is sped up, shooting with the handheld mode is nearly impossible. If you want the camera to appear to be moving slowly in the final timelapse, you will need to move it very slowly while shooting in order to achieve this effect.</p><p>For this reason, we will need to make use of motion control devices in order to accomplish our goal. Therefore, we refer to these kinds of photos as motion control timelapses. The camera can be moved very slowly and accurately along one, two, or all three axes using motors that are controlled electronically. The three-axis systems, which include a slider as well as a pan-tilt head, are by far the most popular.</p><h2 id="Extra-Info-Best-Time-Lapse-Video-Maker-–-Filmora"><a href="#Extra-Info-Best-Time-Lapse-Video-Maker-–-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Extra Info: Best Time Lapse Video Maker – Filmora"></a>Extra Info: Best Time Lapse Video Maker – Filmora</h2><p>To create a time lapse video with cool effects, you can use the best video editor with rich effects – <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Therefore, you shouldn’t be afraid to try out new things by combining time-lapse photography with slow motion and video. In addition, make sure you visit the Hyperlapse Academy so you can become familiar with all of the different approaches. Use your imagination, and don’t stop firing.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-20-visionary-metaverse-projects-with-educational-value/"><u>[New] 20 Visionary Metaverse Projects with Educational Value</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-instagram-perfection-on-ios-and-android-choose-the-top-8-schedulers/"><u>[Updated] Instagram Perfection on iOS & Android - Choose the Top 8 Schedulers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-capturing-unrooted-audio-4-easy-steps-for-android/"><u>2024 Approved Capturing Unrooted Audio 4 Easy Steps for Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-6-drones-for-videography/"><u>2024 Approved Top 6 Drones for Videography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-frp-on-motorola-razr-40-ultra-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Bypass FRP on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-gmail-password-on-vivo-s17t-devices-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Reset Gmail Password on Vivo S17t Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-add-subtitles-to-videos-with-kapwing/"><u>New 2024 Approved How to Add Subtitles to Videos With Kapwing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/new-vsdc-free-video-editor-review-for-2024/"><u>New VSDC Free Video Editor Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/powerless-to-start-a-guide-to-repairing-computers-with-no-electrical-response/"><u>Powerless to Start?

It’s simple; in the 1950s, video-making technologies were slightly advanced, although films were more about rock and roll and poodle skirts. So, without further dilly-dallying, let’s learn how to create a retro 1950-style video with this simple Filmora tutorial.</p><h2 id="Preparation"><a href="#Preparation" class="headerlink" title="Preparation"></a>Preparation</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1950-vintage-scene.gif"                      alt="1950 vintage scene"                ></p><p>Shooting a video to teleport yourself to the 1950s doesn’t need to be complicated. You simply need to look the part in the video. For example, you can wear velvet-collar jackets, stovepipe trousers, carefully combed back hair, and other trendy styles in the 50s. It’s even better if you can find those vintage chairs in your grandparent’s collection.</p><p>How to create a 1950s vintage film:</p><h5 id="Step-1-Add-your-video-on-Filmora"><a href="#Step-1-Add-your-video-on-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Add your video on Filmora"></a>Step 1 Add your video on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-1.jpg"                      alt="add your video on filmora"                ></p><p>First, fire up Filmora and load the video you want to send back to the 1950s.

This is because VLC Media Player offers several useful and advanced features that the default media player like Windows Media Player lacks. There are situations when users need to zoom into certain parts of a video, and that is where VLC zoom in video feature comes in handy.</p><p>You may need to zoom into videos to pay attention to details and focus on parts around the subject that others are missing out. For example, you have recorded a video, and you have played it on VLC to zoom in and ensure that there is nothing distracting before you publish the video. Now, we will illustrate all the different ways on how to zoom in VLC Media Player. We will also suggest a better alternative to zoom into videos easily.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Zoom-VLC-Video-Using-Interactive-Zoom"><a href="#Part-1-Zoom-VLC-Video-Using-Interactive-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom"></a>Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom</h2><p>VLC Media Player comes with Interactive Zoom feature that lets you zoom into a section of a video irrespective of its resolution. You can use Interactive Zoom feature to zoom nearly eight times the original size of the video. While you zoom your video with Interactive Zoom option, VLC Media Player zooms the video digitally, and if the video resolution is not high, you can see some deterioration in video quality as you zoom in. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom with Interactive Zoom.</p><p>Step1First, you have to enable Interactive Zoom feature. Launch VLC Player and go to Tools menu option.</p><p>Step2Select Effects and Filters and you will see Adjustments and Effects window open.</p><p>Step3Go to Video Effects tab and then go to Geometry tab.</p><p>Step4Turn on Interactive Zoom option. Click on Save and Close buttons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-adjustments-and-effects.jpg"                      alt="zoom in vlc"                ></p><p>Step5Play a video and you will see a Picture in Picture window in the top-left corner where you can see live preview of the video. You will notice a rectangular box that you can drag around the PiP window to zoom that section of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-pic-in-pic.jpg"                      alt="zoom in vlc"                ></p><p>Step6Wherever you place the rectangular box in PiP window, that part will be zoomed and shown outside the PiP window.

While Interactive Zoom is for detailed zooming, Zoom through Video menu on VLC is for instant zooming. Moreover, Zoom through Video menu is effective only when you view the video on VLC Player. If you are watching the video on full screen, the zooming effect will not be easily noticeable. Here are the steps on how to zoom in VLC player using VLC Video menu.</p><p>Step1Open VLC Media player in windowed mode and play the desired video.</p><p>Step2Go to Video menu and select Zoom option.</p><p>Step3You will come across several options such as 1:4 quarter, 1:2 half, 1:1 original, and 2:1 double.

A Complete Guide for Beginners to Create These Transitions Using Their Camera at Home</h2><p>You must have seen it in videos when a scene changes to another place or time. How is it possible? Video transitions are a post-production technique that connects two different shots together. And it makes the whole video goes smooth and fluent.</p><p>Hopping directly from one clip to the next looks pretty queer. It disturbs the whole dynamics and charm of the video. To avoid this, we use video transitions. This makes the video appear much smoother and more linked.</p><p>You may think it is not easy, but after reading this article, you will know how simple it is. All you need is a camera and a few skills. In this article, we will focus on different in-camera transitions and let you know how to edit in a powerful video editor <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="Whip-Your-Camera"><a href="#Whip-Your-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Whip Your Camera"></a>Whip Your Camera</h2><p>You may have noticed that when an object moves quickly, the camera creates a blurred image of the object. We call it motion blur. The idea with this transition is to cut and paste your shots together by whipping your camera at the end of your first shot and at the beginning of your second one. This effect depends on two aspects. The first is by the speedy motion of the object out of the frame, and the second is by the camera’s movement.</p><p><strong>Here is a stepwise guide for you to try</strong></p><ol><li>Plan your shots, where and in what direction you will make the whip.</li><li>Then take the first shot and whip the camera at the end of the shot in the direction the object is moving.</li><li>For the next shot, whip the camera into the action and complete the shot.</li><li>Import both shots in your editing tool and find the point of blur in both.</li><li>Cut and paste them to add a blurring effect to your video.</li></ol><p>You can whip your camera in any direction you want. Make sure the movement is fast enough to create a motion blur.</p><p>The result would be a smooth transition from the first shot to the second, as in this clip:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/whip-your-camera.gif"                      alt="whip your camera"                ></p><h2 id="Fill-The-Frame"><a href="#Fill-The-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Fill The Frame"></a>Fill The Frame</h2><p>In this in-camera transition technique, you must fill the frame with an object or subject. Compose the shot with the main subject filling the frame from edge to edge. In this way, those who view the video immediately know what you want them to see.</p><p>Here is step-by-step guidance for this transition</p><ol><li>Plan the two shots you are going to take.</li><li>Find a subject or an action that will fill the frame during recording.</li><li>In the first shot, please make the subject move toward the frame so that it fills the frame.</li><li>The second shot will take place at another time or place.</li><li>To record the second shot, cover the frame with an object and then reveal the shot.</li><li>Import both shots into <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li>Cut the two shots to the point where the frame is filled and paste these shots together.</li></ol><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>One important thing is to match the color and brightness of the object or subject.

Ensure the camera is placed under a <strong>good light</strong> source so that the picture is not dim and the object is exposed. Make sure the camera is placed at the <strong>level of the eye</strong> so that it will help you record your video clearly and accurately.</p><p>Also, keep in mind to <strong>zoom out</strong> the camera lens, which will fix the frame of the video so that the object or the person is entirely on the screen. Another tip for creating a realistic fire effect would be the person acting as the object.

It will be beneficial if you have a <strong>warmer color</strong> light or a light that can change its temperature. You can use <strong>tungsten</strong> light bulbs or small circular <strong>LEDs</strong> that are pretty famous with Vloggers and tick-tock users.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-make-a-realistic-effect-fire-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-make-a-realistic-effect-fire-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Follow the steps below to create a realistic fire effect like a pro.</p><h5 id="Step1-Record-your-footage-1"><a href="#Step1-Record-your-footage-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Record your footage"></a>Step1 Record your footage</h5><p>While recording the video, you can <strong>slightly shake</strong> your light source, which will give it the flickering effect of the flame. Here, you can do this in two ways.</p><p><strong>Shaking the light manually</strong></p><p>Just make sure when you are shaking the light, it is not shaken aggressively, or it will lose its realism to a real fire.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-1.gif"                      alt="shaking the light source"                ></p><p><strong>Shaking the light using a dimmer</strong></p><p>You can also use some skills to create the flickering effect of the fire without literally shaking the LED light. Dimmers come to help. A dimmer is a device that enables you to change the temperature of the LED light. If you have a <strong>dimmer</strong>, your work will be more accessible.</p><p>A <strong>regulator</strong> on the dimmer will help you switch between low and high tones. It will flicker the light on the object like a flame and make it look like it was placed in front of a real fire.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-2.jpg"                      alt="dimmer for shaking"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Record-the-object-1"><a href="#Step2-Record-the-object-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Record the object"></a>Step2 Record the object</h5><p>Our next step will be to record the object on which the effect is taking place. Ensure the camera is placed under a <strong>good light</strong> source so that the picture is not dim and the object is exposed. Make sure the camera is placed at the <strong>level of the eye</strong> so that it will help you record your video clearly and accurately.</p><p>Also, keep in mind to <strong>zoom out</strong> the camera lens, which will fix the frame of the video so that the object or the person is entirely on the screen. Another tip for creating a realistic fire effect would be the person acting as the object. The more natural the acting is, the more realistic would be the fire effect.</p><h5 id="Step3-Edit-the-footage-1"><a href="#Step3-Edit-the-footage-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Edit the footage"></a>Step3 Edit the footage</h5><p>We are being safe and saving time by not using actual fire.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Easy-Way-to-Create-a-DIY-Green-Screen-Video-Effect"><a href="#Easy-Way-to-Create-a-DIY-Green-Screen-Video-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Easy Way to Create a DIY Green Screen Video Effect"></a>Easy Way to Create a DIY Green Screen Video Effect</h2><p>No matter how big the budget of a Hollywood movie is, at the end of the day, it has to rely on the humble green screens for special video effects. The stunning studios from where your favorite YouTubers and gamers stream their videos are graphical video effects created through green screens. Even the studios that you see on TV channels are a graphical creation of green screens. You must be wondering how they could achieve such awesome graphics with a simple green screen.</p><p>All you need is a good-quality green fabric, a professional video editing software, and a camera. You may not believe it, but that is all you need for creating DIY green screen video effect. You do not have to be a professional video editor to edit the green screen on your videos and add any special video effect. In this article, you will learn how to create your own DIY green backdrop.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Green-Screen-Technique"><a href="#What-Is-Green-Screen-Technique" class="headerlink" title="What Is Green Screen Technique?"></a>What Is Green Screen Technique?</h2><p>A green screen is nothing but a green fabric. In a video, a green screen is placed in the background behind the subject. In the editing phase of the video, the green screen is replaced with any background image or video effect that stays intact in the video as long as possible. In short, the green screen technique involves superimposing photos and videos on the green screen in a video.</p><p>Starting from the video game industry, movie industry to video streaming and TV channels, the green screen technique is used everywhere. The stunning graphical component of these industries is totally dependent on the green screen technique. In fact, DIY green screen for zoom meetings and video conferencing is widely used. Along with that, YouTubers and Twitch streamers use DIY green screen for streaming live.</p><p>Technically speaking, instead of a green screen, you can use any other color of screen. However, green screens are widely used, and it has become a norm. The main point to remember when using a green screen is that nothing else should have green color such as the dresses the subject is wearing. Therefore, in technical terms, the green screen is referred to as Chroma Key, and you will find Chroma Key option instead of green screen in most video editors.</p><h2 id="Why-Use-Green-Screen-Technique"><a href="#Why-Use-Green-Screen-Technique" class="headerlink" title="Why Use Green Screen Technique?"></a>Why Use Green Screen Technique?</h2><p>The main reason why the green screen technique is used in movie and video making is that the video editor can replace the entire background at once instead of replacing the background frame by frame. Once you replace a green screen with an image or video effect, it stays the same throughout the video as long as required.</p><p>Therefore, the video editor can save a lot of time in editing and the editing stays uniform throughout which gives a realistic effect. If the green screen technique is not used and editing is done frame by frame of a video, there could be a manual error, inconsistent, and graphical glitches.</p><p>You can replace green screens with anything you want. It could be a still image of a beautiful studio with 3D effect like you see in case of YouTubers and gamers. It could be a moving, real-life landscape on any place in the world instead of a beautiful background picture. Similarly, it could be replaced by video effects such as explosions, stadiums full of people, battlefields, and likewise. At times, it could be live animations as you see on TV channels.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886073/19272" target="_top" id="1886073">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886073" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886073/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-To-Create-DIY-Green-Screen-Stand-Setup-and-Add-Green-Screen-Effect"><a href="#How-To-Create-DIY-Green-Screen-Stand-Setup-and-Add-Green-Screen-Effect" class="headerlink" title="How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?"></a>How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?</h2><p>If you want to have a green screen setup for your video, you need to have the following things ready.</p><ul><li>A green cloth that is large enough to cover the entire background.</li><li>A video editing software to replace green screen in your video with anything.</li><li>External light for more video clarity and a good camera with mic.</li></ul><p>Step 1: Setup DIY Green Backdrop</p><p>Your green fabric should be soft and bright. If you are going to be the subject of the video, make sure you are not wearing anything green. Moreover, do not keep any object within the video frame that is green in color. If there are too many green objects, you can use a blue screen.</p><p>When it comes to hanging the green cloth in the background, people find it very difficult. If your video frame is going to be a close-up to the subject, you can use a green screen panel to hang green cloth. A green screen panel generally has a collapsible structure for easy storage and transportation.</p><p>Otherwise, you need to install hooks in the wall if you are planning to replace the green screen with a studio-like scene so that the entire background of the video frame stays covered with green screen. You should opt for multiple green screens and stitch them together to cover the background completely.</p><p>Step 2: Setup Camera and Light</p><p>Whether you are shooting with a DSLR camera or smartphone camera or webcam, make sure you are shooting at least HD video quality so that the editing could be great. Lights are important when you are using green screen though they are not a necessity. The video quality and brightness get enhanced with lights. Diffused lights work the best and the background should be well-lit.</p><p>Most importantly, you have to place the lights in such a way that your body arms should not be casting any shadow on the green screen. You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.</p><p>Step 3: Get The Best Video Editor For Green Screen Effect</p><p>There are various video editors available, but not all of them are suitable for green screen effect. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best video editor to apply green screen effects on your video while editing. The reason behind the recommendation is that the steps to replace the green screen with any image or video are super simple and anyone can do it. There is no need to be a professional video editor.</p><p>Wondershare Filmora also lets you capture video through webcam and you can also capture your screen. It is perfect for recording gameplay as well as your reaction and commentary. Similarly, you can record demonstrations, tutorial videos, as well as video conferences. You can apply green screen effects to your recorded video instantly and publish on different platforms. In fact, you can adjust all the parameters such as color scheme, audio ducking, keyframing, motion tracking and much more to enhance the video output quality.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Making videos with DIY green screen stand is no more an esoteric concept. You can set it up anywhere and start shooting video. The magic begins in the post-production stage where you can use Wondershare Filmora to replace the green screen with video effects that will blow the mind of your viewers and followers.

If there are too many green objects, you can use a blue screen.</p><p>When it comes to hanging the green cloth in the background, people find it very difficult. If your video frame is going to be a close-up to the subject, you can use a green screen panel to hang green cloth. A green screen panel generally has a collapsible structure for easy storage and transportation.</p><p>Otherwise, you need to install hooks in the wall if you are planning to replace the green screen with a studio-like scene so that the entire background of the video frame stays covered with green screen. You should opt for multiple green screens and stitch them together to cover the background completely.</p><p>Step 2: Setup Camera and Light</p><p>Whether you are shooting with a DSLR camera or smartphone camera or webcam, make sure you are shooting at least HD video quality so that the editing could be great. Lights are important when you are using green screen though they are not a necessity. The video quality and brightness get enhanced with lights. Diffused lights work the best and the background should be well-lit.</p><p>Most importantly, you have to place the lights in such a way that your body arms should not be casting any shadow on the green screen. You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.</p><p>Step 3: Get The Best Video Editor For Green Screen Effect</p><p>There are various video editors available, but not all of them are suitable for green screen effect. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best video editor to apply green screen effects on your video while editing. The reason behind the recommendation is that the steps to replace the green screen with any image or video are super simple and anyone can do it.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Ideas-for-Time-Lapse-Video"><a href="#Ideas-for-Time-Lapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="Ideas for Time-Lapse Video"></a>Ideas for Time-Lapse Video</h2><p>Are you thinking of stepping out of the familiar world of still photography to make a time-lapse video?</p><p>As you all know I am a fan of travel videos and time-lapse video because why not? There is no denying that time-lapse techniques are a perfect medium for travel videos.</p><p>In this article will give you some ideas to get started in time-lapse video or photography and let’s define what a time-lapse video and what makes them great.</p><h2 id="What-is-Time-Lapse"><a href="#What-is-Time-Lapse" class="headerlink" title="What is Time Lapse"></a>What is Time Lapse</h2><p>Time-lapse is a creative filming and video editing technique that manipulates how the frame rate is captured. Frame rate is the number of images or frames appearing in a second of video. In most videos, the frame rate and playback speed are the same. In a time-lapse video, the frame rate is stretched out far more: when played back at average speed, time appears to be sped up.</p><p>Time-lapse can also refer to a camera’s shutter speed (How long the camera’s shutter remains open to let light in). A similar effect to time-lapse is found in stop-motion videos. The subject doesn’t move but seems to be in motion because it’s manually or repeatedly moved and then photographed. The images are then strung together to create video-like motion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/time-lapse-car-video.jpg"                      alt="time lapse car video"                ></p><h2 id="How-Time-lapse-Works"><a href="#How-Time-lapse-Works" class="headerlink" title="How Time-lapse Works"></a>How Time-lapse Works</h2><p>Time-lapse photography is a technique that records a scene or objects that change at a slow speed and turns it into a video that plays back at high speed.</p><p>Most time-lapse videos are projected at a speed of 30 frames per second. The frame rate of your time-lapse video can be determined in the editing process, but you will need to account for how quickly the action is taking place in the camera or your video will be a collection if stills. Consider what FPS you want to use in your video. You need to capture that many frames per second to create a time-lapse effect. If you’re shooting a 10 second video at 30fps, you should end up with 300 images.</p><p>What equipment needed for time-lapse video?</p><p>Time-lapse photography requires only a few special pieces of equipment.</p><p><strong>1. Camera &#x2F; Smartphones</strong></p><p>Technically any point and shoot camera or smartphone can be used for time-lapse video, the easiest ones to work are DSLR or mirrorless cameras, some even have an in camera intervalometer (often called a time-lapse feature or time-lapse mode), which means you’ll need less equipment to take great time-lapse video.</p><p><strong>2. High-capacity Memory Card</strong></p><p>For the best results, shoot in RAW format which takes image in the highest resolution with actual image dimensions. You’ll need to prepare for very large RAW file sizes, so bring multiple high capacity memory cards.</p><p><strong>3.Tripod</strong></p><p>A tripod is essential to time-lapse video or photography, because the camera needs to stay perfectly still in order to emphasize the steady movement of your subject and to avoid overlay blurry videos or photos.</p><h2 id="How-to-Capture-Times-lapse-Video"><a href="#How-to-Capture-Times-lapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Capture Times-lapse Video"></a>How to Capture Times-lapse Video</h2><p>A technique that was once found only in video editing software is now on nearly every mobile device. So what’s the best way to make an amazing time-lapse video that stands apart from the rest? That depends on how you plan to capture the footage.</p><p><strong>Smartphones:</strong></p><p>Most phones have a time-lapse feature in their camera app. Be advised: you will need to record for an extended period, as 30 minutes equates to about 10 seconds of footage. Like a video camera, you will need a tripod to steady your shots. On an iPhone, you can either film a time-lapse or stitch one together from your photo collection, all without a video editor.</p><p><strong>DSLR Camera</strong></p><p>For DSLR camera you’ll need a tripod and a device called intervalometer. The first is essential to make sure your camera is stationary and is taking photos if the exact same location without moving anywhere.</p><p>An intervalometer, or a remote control, is a device that allows you to set your camera to hit the shutter button at an interval of your choice. In other words, an intervalometer is there to let you rest aside without having a manually click the shutter button yourself.</p><p><strong>Here are some video ideas for your time-lapse</strong></p><ul><li>Ice melting</li><li>Flower and plants</li><li>Clouds moving</li><li>Sunrise&#x2F;sunset</li><li>Star movement</li><li>Traffic movement</li></ul><p><strong>Ice melting</strong></p><p>Time-lapse is an ideal way to capture the mesmerizing transition between water and ice. Even something as simple as watching ice melt can be appealing.</p><p><strong>Flower and plants</strong></p><p>Flowers and plants can be beautiful to behold, but their transformation from seed to adult plant is often absolutely breathtaking. If you have an indoor plant that you are about to start growing you can set up a camera on a mount of a tripod at the angle with which you want to capture. As you water, groom or fertilize on a regular schedule, you can incorporate taking a photograph at the same time.</p><p><strong>Clouds moving</strong></p><p>The clouds can provide a whole host of phenomena that will both enlighten the observer to the complexities of the atmosphere or cosmos but will also provide a beautiful spectacle in the daytime, the movement of clouds can be quite spell binding and the rolling in of rain or a thunderstorm can be particularly interesting.</p><p><strong>Sunrise&#x2F;Sunset</strong></p><p>Shooting a sunset is more difficult. The light changes during the selected time period.</p><p>To overcome this, use remote control camera software. This can be compensated by increasing the ISO or decreasing the shutter speed as the light dims.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/shoot-sunset-timelapse-video.jpg"                      alt="shoot sunset timelapse video"                ></p><p><strong>Star movement</strong></p><p>At night, if the sky is clear and you are in an area dark enough, the stars in the sky can provide a beautiful time-lapse as the stars move in relation to the observer due to earths rotations.</p><p><strong>Traffic movement</strong></p><p>The interconnectedness of vehicles moving along busy roads, trailing light patterns, and the general hustle and bustle of city life can be brought to you in a dynamic way via time-lapse videos.</p><p>It is the smooth impression of motion which time-lapse is able to produce that can emphasize and help to invigorate something as ordinary and everyday as the coming and going of traffic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/traffic-movement-timelapse-video.jpg"                      alt="traffic movement timelapse video"                ></p><p><strong>Edit your video with Wondershare Filmora</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has the action camera tool that allows you to fasten up your video without re-encoding.

A Complete Guide for Beginners to Create These Transitions Using Their Camera at Home</h2><p>You must have seen it in videos when a scene changes to another place or time. How is it possible? Video transitions are a post-production technique that connects two different shots together. And it makes the whole video goes smooth and fluent.</p><p>Hopping directly from one clip to the next looks pretty queer. It disturbs the whole dynamics and charm of the video. To avoid this, we use video transitions. This makes the video appear much smoother and more linked.</p><p>You may think it is not easy, but after reading this article, you will know how simple it is. All you need is a camera and a few skills. In this article, we will focus on different in-camera transitions and let you know how to edit in a powerful video editor <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134227/18498" target="_top" id="2134227">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134227" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134227/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Whip-Your-Camera"><a href="#Whip-Your-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Whip Your Camera"></a>Whip Your Camera</h2><p>You may have noticed that when an object moves quickly, the camera creates a blurred image of the object. We call it motion blur. The idea with this transition is to cut and paste your shots together by whipping your camera at the end of your first shot and at the beginning of your second one. This effect depends on two aspects. The first is by the speedy motion of the object out of the frame, and the second is by the camera’s movement.</p><p><strong>Here is a stepwise guide for you to try</strong></p><ol><li>Plan your shots, where and in what direction you will make the whip.</li><li>Then take the first shot and whip the camera at the end of the shot in the direction the object is moving.</li><li>For the next shot, whip the camera into the action and complete the shot.</li><li>Import both shots in your editing tool and find the point of blur in both.</li><li>Cut and paste them to add a blurring effect to your video.</li></ol><p>You can whip your camera in any direction you want. Make sure the movement is fast enough to create a motion blur.</p><p>The result would be a smooth transition from the first shot to the second, as in this clip:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/whip-your-camera.gif"                      alt="whip your camera"                ></p><h2 id="Fill-The-Frame"><a href="#Fill-The-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Fill The Frame"></a>Fill The Frame</h2><p>In this in-camera transition technique, you must fill the frame with an object or subject.

Add Video Font Effects on Mac"></a>Part 2. Add Video Font Effects on Mac</h2><p>If you are using a Mac where you want to edit your video and add font effects, you do not have to install any external video editor. This is because Mac comes with a built-in video editor called iMovie by Apple where you can easily add font effects. There are different types of video font effects available on iMovie starting from animated titles to credits and callouts. You can get similar font for After Effect on iMovie. Here are the steps to add video font effects on Mac.</p><p>Step1Open iMovie on your Mac from Applications folder.

Try getting shots low to the ground as well as at higher angles. That will give you more options to cut between when you edit the video.</li><li>Get various shots. You can get shots of dribbling, shooting, and just running with the ball to work with.</li><li>Try shooting on a longer lens. It is because you may not be able to get close to the action.</li><li>Record footage in slow mode on your camera or phone. It will allow you to capture more frames: the more frames, the smoother the slow-motion effect.</li></ul><p>Best capturing will make your video more cinematic and visually pleasing after preparing the footage.

One is to use the speed ramping feature to adjust the video speed—the other way to achieve a similar effect is by using the standard speed settings.</p><p><strong>Edit with speed ramping feature in Filmora</strong></p><p>The speed ramping feature is included in Filmora standard license. So let’s start by opening Filmora.</p><p>1. Import media</p><p>First, import a video from your media library in the Wondershare Filmora. And drag the clip down on the timeline to start editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-3.jpg"                      alt="library in wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>2. Apply the speed ramping feature</p><p>To apply the speed ramping feature, <strong>right-click</strong> on the clip on the timeline. And click speed in the menu and choose <strong>speed ramping</strong> to open the settings window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-4.jpg"                      alt="add speed ramping option"                ></p><p>You can choose different speed templates in the setting window. Or, on the left corner, click on the customize option to adjust the keyframes and create the speed you want for the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-5.jpg"                      alt="speed templates on wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>The lower keyframe is when the video is slowest, and the peak is when the video is fastest. The middle parts between the keyframes are when it speeds up or slows down to reach the specific speed you set on each keyframe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-6.gif"                      alt="adjusting key-frames wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>Grab the keyframes and move them up to increase the speed or down to slow down the rate. You can also add more keyframes by moving the playhead to the spot where you want to change speed and clicking the plus button.</p><p>After adjusting our keyframes, we can play it back to see if we like the result.</p><p><strong>Edit with standard speed settings in Filmora</strong></p><p>Since speed ramping can only be used for paid users, we also provide you with an alternative way to give an exact transition effect, like speed ramping. Check out the following steps to add it.</p><p>1. You can <strong>drag</strong> the video from your library to the timeline. While in the <strong>timeline</strong>, double-click to open the speed menu.

Go to File &gt; Export &gt; Add to Render Queue, then open the Render Queue dialog box by going to Window &gt; Render Queue. From there, you can choose the Output Module and change the settings in the options dialog box. Finally, choose the Output To option and select the location on your computer where you would like to save the video clip that we are currently rendering and exporting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/add-to-render-queue-after-effects.jpg"                      alt="add to render queue after effects"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>No matter how you make your time lapse videos, After Effects has a ton of features you can use to modify and enhance the way they look.

    <updated>2024-10-03T04:38:56.155Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-To-Create-A-Green-Screen-Video-In-After-Effects"><a href="#How-To-Create-A-Green-Screen-Video-In-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="How To Create A Green Screen Video In After Effects"></a>How To Create A Green Screen Video In After Effects</h2><p>You’ll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We’ll demonstrate how to do easily for you.</p><p>Let’s start off!</p><h2 id="1-Importing-your-footage"><a href="#1-Importing-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="1. Importing your footage"></a>1. Importing your footage</h2><p>After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the “Image Utilities” heading.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-green-screen-video-footage-ae.jpg"                      alt="import green screen video footage ae"                ></p><h2 id="2-Remove-the-green-color"><a href="#2-Remove-the-green-color" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove the green color"></a>2. Remove the green color</h2><p>After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the “Animation Presets” window, searching for the “Keylight” preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the “Effects Controls” window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen’s background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/remove-green-color-from-video-in-ae.jpg"                      alt="remove green color from video in ae"                ></p><h2 id="3-Clean-up-the-shot"><a href="#3-Clean-up-the-shot" class="headerlink" title="3. Clean up the shot"></a>3. Clean up the shot</h2><p>You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.</p><p>Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg"                      alt="clean up green screen shot ae"                ></p><p>You can go to the “Screen Matte” area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you’ve applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="The-Best-Cinematic-LUTs-in-The-Market"><a href="#The-Best-Cinematic-LUTs-in-The-Market" class="headerlink" title="The Best Cinematic LUTs in The Market"></a>The Best Cinematic LUTs in The Market</h2><p>With the development of new editing tools and apps, we all want our content to look different and better from others. Moreover, increasing social media usage has also made people more concerned about their photos and videos.

They can be used to make the footage look vintage or retro or to create a dark, moody atmosphere or a bright, colorful tone. Furthermore, these <strong>cinematic LUTs</strong> can match the footage’s colors and tones so they all look the same. They can also be used to contrast and color your photos and images.</p><p>It can also make your media files look like they were filmed on a real film camera, giving them a more natural, organic feel.

Balance Beam</p><p>Ever wanted to walk across a small beam way high up in the air? Me neither, but you can make a cool effect that looks like you did. Throwing a green screen on the ground and then building a balance beam over top of it you can start recording the main shot. Strap a GoPro to your head and look down while walking across the beam.</p><p>2. Shrink Effect</p><p>Okay this one is really easy. Take some footage of a person walking in front of a green screen, ideally looking at something to be featured in the main shot to sell the effect. Then take a close up of a small object. Key out the green behind the person, take the footage and drop it over your close up, and then scale it to match. Duplicate it, mirror it horizontally to act as a reflection and then drop the opacity and add some blur to make it look more realistic. It’s a fun little trick.</p><p>3. Floating Object</p><p>This is a simple one, making an object appear to be floating. This is another two clip shot. First, take a shot with the object hanging in front of a blue screen. Then on the same location, take another shot but while pretending to levitate the hammer. Masking around the hammer will get rid of the string for hanging, key out the blue, and then dropping it on top of the other clip is all you need.</p><h2 id="Best-Green-Screen-Video-Editor-for-YouTube"><a href="#Best-Green-Screen-Video-Editor-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Best Green Screen Video Editor for YouTube"></a>Best Green Screen Video Editor for YouTube</h2><p><strong>Filmora</strong></p><p>If you’re just starting out with video editing, or just want a simple program that works, Wondershare Filmora might be what you’re looking for.

Removing the colored background is also referred to as “chroma keying.”</p><p><strong>Steps with Images</strong></p><p>The first step is to record footage in front of a green screen so that you can import it into WeVideo as a media file. To capture footage that is optimal for the Green Screen effect, please ensure the following:</p><ul><li>There is ample lighting distributed evenly around you with no shadows.</li><li>You are in front of a <strong>solid background with no creases</strong>. Green or blue is the recommended color for your background.</li><li>The quality of your camera is high enough so that the footage is not pixelated or grainy. 720p HD footage or above is recommended.</li></ul><p>Step 2) Add media to the Timeline</p><p>Once you’ve captured the footage you want to use for the Green Screen effect, import that media file and add it to the Timeline.

However, if you would like to make these additional modifications, you can use the scroll bars to make the following adjustments:</p><ul><li>**<strong>Show</strong>- You can select Mask to reveal a black and white representation of the mask you are applying using the color keying tool. Notice that the black area represents transparent sections of your video, while the white area represents opaque sections.</li><li>**<strong>Color Balance</strong>- This adjusts how selective the effect is. The further right you scroll, the wider the range of tints and shades are removed.</li><li>**<strong>Color Sensitivity</strong>- This smooths out any pixelation and rough edges of color that remain.</li><li>**<strong>Defringe</strong>- This helps reduce color bleeding at the edges of your mask. The left and right sliders control the level of white and black respectively to help match the edges of the mask with your new background color.</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934188/19272" target="_top" id="1934188">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934188" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934188/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Use-Adjustment-Layer-in-Photoshop"><a href="#How-to-Use-Adjustment-Layer-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Adjustment Layer in Photoshop?"></a>How to Use Adjustment Layer in Photoshop?</h2><p>Adobe Photoshop is a famous and powerful image editor through which you can draw captivating illustrations proficiently.

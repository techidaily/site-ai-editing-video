Alternatively, click on the “Import” button in the upper left corner to browse and load the MOV file from your hard drive or external storage device. A third option is to right-click on the video in the media library and choose “Import Media Files” from the drop-down menu.

From here, you can choose how you want your file exported from a number of options including GIF under the Formats tab.

Alternatively, click on the “Import” button in the upper left corner to browse and load the MOV file from your hard drive or external storage device. A third option is to right-click on the video in the media library and choose “Import Media Files” from the drop-down menu. This will open up a new window where you can select your desired video file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-9.jpg"                      alt="import media files in wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>Now that you have successfully imported your MOV file into Filmora, let’s look at how to proceed with making a GIF out of it.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Trim to shorten the video</strong></p><p>Next, you will need to trim the video. This is optional, but important if you want to make a GIF from a video. A longer video means a bigger file size and an increased loading time for your final GIF, so try to keep it as short as possible!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-10.jpg"                      alt="trim the video in wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>To trim your video, add another start and endpoint by clicking on the scissors icon below. You can also put them in manually by typing in the time (in seconds) into the box provided.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Export as GIF</strong></p><p>Click on the Export button to open up the Export dialog box. From here, you can choose how you want your file exported from a number of options including GIF under the Formats tab. Under the Video tab, select the video quality settings that best suit your requirements. You can also set the frame rate and resolution for your GIF image file at this point. Once you are done, click on Save to specify a location for your file as well as a name for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-11.jpg"                      alt="export mov to gif in wondershare filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Save the GIF file</strong></p><p>Click “Convert” to start the MOV to GIF conversion.</p><p>When it’s done, click “Open Folder”, and you’ll see the generated GIF file there, which could be shared with others via social platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook directly or used for other purposes.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We have not gathered several MOV to GIF converters for you to buy, but we have gone ahead and selected some and explained how to use them in easy steps.

Alternatively, click on the “Import” button in the upper left corner to browse and load the MOV file from your hard drive or external storage device. A third option is to right-click on the video in the media library and choose “Import Media Files” from the drop-down menu. This will open up a new window where you can select your desired video file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-9.jpg"                      alt="import media files in wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>Now that you have successfully imported your MOV file into Filmora, let’s look at how to proceed with making a GIF out of it.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Trim to shorten the video</strong></p><p>Next, you will need to trim the video. This is optional, but important if you want to make a GIF from a video. A longer video means a bigger file size and an increased loading time for your final GIF, so try to keep it as short as possible!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-10.jpg"                      alt="trim the video in wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>To trim your video, add another start and endpoint by clicking on the scissors icon below. You can also put them in manually by typing in the time (in seconds) into the box provided.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Export as GIF</strong></p><p>Click on the Export button to open up the Export dialog box. From here, you can choose how you want your file exported from a number of options including GIF under the Formats tab. Under the Video tab, select the video quality settings that best suit your requirements. You can also set the frame rate and resolution for your GIF image file at this point. Once you are done, click on Save to specify a location for your file as well as a name for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-11.jpg"                      alt="export mov to gif in wondershare filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Save the GIF file</strong></p><p>Click “Convert” to start the MOV to GIF conversion.</p><p>When it’s done, click “Open Folder”, and you’ll see the generated GIF file there, which could be shared with others via social platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook directly or used for other purposes.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We have not gathered several MOV to GIF converters for you to buy, but we have gone ahead and selected some and explained how to use them in easy steps.

Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p><p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p><p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p><p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p><p>From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final touch.</p><p>Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7:</strong>  Enjoy your GIF.</p><p>Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.</p><p><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Use <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> to easily edit your videos using amazing tools, filters and affects.

Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p><p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p><p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p><p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p><p>From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final touch.</p><p>Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7:</strong>  Enjoy your GIF.</p><p>Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.</p><p><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Use <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> to easily edit your videos using amazing tools, filters and affects.

Consumers are now savvy as they now take a step further, like using ad blockers or tuning out ads.</p><p>However, it doesn’t imply the end of advertising as a brand promotion tool altogether. Individuals still desire best-in-class deals and products and spend their money shopping. All they need is to get informed about the product or service more entertainingly and innovatively.</p><p>This is one of the reasons why many established brands are now shifting toward their <strong>brand storytelling</strong>. And there’s no better and highly effective way to portray <strong>your brand story</strong> than with video. Simply making a video resembling any conventional TV commercial ad with an irritating ‘Call Today’ voiceover won’t be enough to get results.</p><p>Modern-day consumers are much more educated and sophisticated than before. You must learn how many creative and successful brands are infusing their <strong>branding and storytelling</strong> strategies to engage their customers. If you’re reading this article, you’re aiming to build your own <strong>brand storytelling video</strong> and are wondering how to make it a successful one.</p><p>Take no worries as the further sections will clear all your doubts and give you the perfect answer.

The Most Successful Video Practises of Brand Storytelling</h2><h3 id="1-Spotify-All-Ears-On-You"><a href="#1-Spotify-All-Ears-On-You" class="headerlink" title="1. Spotify - All Ears On You"></a>1. Spotify - All Ears On You</h3><p>Since 2008, Spotify has continued gathering as much information (personal preferences, likes, and dislikes) about their audiences as possible. It has helped them set personalized ad campaigns that will best fit their customers’ interests.</p><p>One of their latest, popular campaigns is ‘All Ears On You.’ Take a glimpse of this <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCXJrqUdrk" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to check how the video ad appears. Launched in June, this campaign focuses on celebrating your weird listening habits. It leveraged the users’ in-app experience to let them be proud of their unique choices. This helped Spotify to strengthen its emotional relationship with its listeners.</p><p><strong>Learn From Spotify’s Famous Marketing Practices:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Get the Most Out of Big Data:</strong> The customer insights and data helped Spotify make precise, on-point ads. Your firm should also acquire customers’ data and later leverage it to amplify the user experience and make marketing campaigns more relatable.</li><li><strong>Leverage User-Generated Content:</strong> Your audience is more interested in what other customers think and say about your business. The most successful video ads don’t involve facts about the company but the customers instead. Make a video using clips where your customers tell a story about themselves and their experience with your brand.</li><li><strong>Utilize The Trending Hashtags &amp;</strong> <strong>Topics</strong>: Social medial trends and news feed is what attracts today’s customers the most. Spotify’s advertisement team always wraps their ad campaigns into a package of top-events-and-stories. Find the most popular and trending hashtags and topics related to your business niche and incorporate them in your brand storytelling video.</li></ul><p>Some other marketing practices that teach valuable lessons to businesses for brand video marketing include:</p><ul><li>Leveraging the mentions on social media platforms</li><li>Going for a customer-centric marketing approach with personalized interactions</li></ul><h3 id="2-Airbnb-The-Story-of-a-Symbol-of-Belonging"><a href="#2-Airbnb-The-Story-of-a-Symbol-of-Belonging" class="headerlink" title="2.

Airbnb - The Story of a Symbol of Belonging</h3><p>The center of focus of <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMITXMrrVQU" >Airbnb’s brand story <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> revolves around the basic ideology of ‘belonging.’ The brand found its mission - to shape the world into a place where individuals can ‘belong anywhere.’</p><p>Their official tagline also turned out to be ‘Belong Anywhere,’ which eventually led to the development of their whole brand story and new logo. This symbol was created to make sure it’s instantly recognizable.</p><p><strong>Valuable Storytelling Lessons From Airbnb’s Marketing Practices:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Let Your Customers Be At The Heart Of Your Organization</strong>: After interviewing users, Airbnb found out that no one can better inform them about their company than the community of their regular users. The conversations and interviews with such users helped Airbnb to prepare its entire brand story. Thus, you should, too, keep your customers at your core.</li><li><strong>It’s Never Too Late To Discover Your Story</strong>: Although launched in 2008, the company Airbnb realized they’d need to discover their business mission to scale and progress. They are an example that it’s never too late for your brand to find the brand story.</li><li><strong>Content Is The King:</strong> Airbnb always keeps posting content on its own blog and YouTube channel. Most of their content is based on user experiences and revolves around stories from within the brand’s community. Such high-quality content helped them to engage with the customers more efficiently.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Apple-Chase"><a href="#3-Apple-Chase" class="headerlink" title="3. Apple - Chase"></a>3. Apple - Chase</h3><p>Chase recently announced via email their latest introduction to the market - Apple Pay. They introduced it in collaboration with Apple as the new mode to pay. Chase leveraged this email communication to inform people about their latest collaboration with Apple.</p><p>They also used email to reinforce their commitment to helping people to buy Apple products like the <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=175GAmhgzSk" >iPhone 14 pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with accessible funds. While ensuring to align with Apple’s marketing strategy for the Apple Pay service announcement (primarily based on social media), Chase put more emphasis on real-time media.</p><p>Their marketing practice used direct, real-time media to connect with the on-the-go audience seemingly ready to buy an Apple product with a quick source of funds. Their brand story ad focused more on the ‘on-the-go’ audience who would readily agree to make such a purchase.</p><h3 id="4-Nike-Most-Powerful-Brand-Story-Videos"><a href="#4-Nike-Most-Powerful-Brand-Story-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4.

Occasionally, individuals use their phones to shoot slow-motion films if they have an in-built function, and if their phone does not have an in-built feature, they may use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >slow-motion video creator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> applications to assist them.</p><p>But what happens if you have previously filmed a video at regular speed and now want the movie to be converted to slow motion?</p><p>Maybe a video of you from the pool when you’re flipping your hair, but no one remembers to take it in slow motion?

For example, you may use the Photos App pre-installed on Windows 10 machines to apply the slow-motion effect to your photographs.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Right click the video and choose Open with Photos. If it has been recorded by an iPhone or Android device and stored up to OneDrive, it should appear in the Microsoft Photos app without any further effort. Just click it to preview the video.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the <strong>Edit &amp; Create</strong> option on the right corner on the top, and then select <strong>Add slo-mo</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-slo-mo-effect-windows-photos-app.jpg"                      alt="add slo mo effect windows photos app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using the slider, you can determine how slowly you want it to go. Microsoft has built-in support for “<strong>Slow</strong>“ and “<strong>Super-Slow</strong>“ performance levels. Drag the slide to the right end will trigger the super slow mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-10-photos-adjust-slow-motion-speed.jpg"                      alt="windows 10 photos adjust slow motion speed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Specifiy the part that you want to apply slow motion in the playback bar at the bottom, and then save the video that you have just <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >created with slow motion effects on Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>The possibility exists that you are using an older version of Windows 10 on your computer if you do not see the option anywhere in the Photos app. You can also follow the steps above to create a slow motion video on Windows 11.</p><p>Browse Windows Update from the system menu and click on the appropriate button. When all of the updates have been installed, you will have the most recent version of the Photos app, which includes this functionality.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Convert-Normal-Video-to-Slow-Motion-for-Free-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Convert-Normal-Video-to-Slow-Motion-for-Free-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Convert Normal Video to Slow Motion for Free on Mac?"></a>Part 2: How to Convert Normal Video to Slow Motion for Free on Mac?</h2><p>Slow-motion videos are among the most enjoyable parts of utilizing your iPhone for videography.

The good news is that iMovie for Mac can do this for you. We’ll show you how in this guide.</p><p>Slow-motion films are easy to make <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >using iMovie on your Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Creating a <strong>Project</strong> is required at this stage. To do so, click on the Projects option.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you’ve entered a name for your project, click the blue <strong>OK</strong> button.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> By dragging the movie onto your timeline, you may modify the video.

You may just choose the “<strong>Normal</strong>“ option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video’s frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the <strong>Check</strong> box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-video-speed-capcut-normal.jpg"                      alt="change speed  in capcut"                ></p><p>Make a slow motion video at this stage to spice things up.

Green Screen Video Tips to Use"></a>Part 3. Green Screen Video Tips to Use</h2><p>We have already stated that replacing green screen in your video with an eye-catching background is the easiest part. On the contrary, shooting the green screen video is the most important part. If you shoot the video perfectly, replacing the background accurately in the video editor becomes super easy. Here are some important tips to use while shooting green screen video.</p><p><strong>Distance</strong> – There should be enough distance between the subject and the green screen background so that the subject does not cast a shadow on the green screen. This distance is also important to place lights in between so that the green screen is perfectly lit for a great video shooting session.</p><p><strong>Quality</strong> – You should opt for a high-quality green screen cloth for the background. This means the green screen should have a solid color instead of light and dark patches here and there. Besides, you should ensure that there are no wrinkles on the green screen.</p><p>Otherwise, when you will apply green screen effect through the video editor, the transformation will be uneven. You have to spend a lot of time adjusting the parameters to cover up uneven patches in the background.</p><p><strong>Lighting</strong> – The way you set up your lights plays a major role in shooting green screen video perfectly. The light falling on the green screen will light up the screen evenly so that there are no light and dark patches. Transforming the green screen in the video editor will become that much easier.</p><p>You should focus on soft and even lighting for the entire green screen, and you should check through your camera to ensure the lighting is perfect. Sometimes, you can place lights behind the subject if the subject is staying stationary throughout the video. Otherwise, you can place the light above the subject for even distribution.</p><p><strong>Aperture</strong> – The settings of your camera are equally important to smoothen out the green screen in the background and focus on the subject sharply. That is where aperture comes into the scene, and you need to use low aperture while shooting green screen videos. Low aperture opens up the camera lens, and the green screen turns softer in the background.

Green Screen Video Tips to Use"></a>Part 3. Green Screen Video Tips to Use</h2><p>We have already stated that replacing green screen in your video with an eye-catching background is the easiest part. On the contrary, shooting the green screen video is the most important part. If you shoot the video perfectly, replacing the background accurately in the video editor becomes super easy. Here are some important tips to use while shooting green screen video.</p><p><strong>Distance</strong> – There should be enough distance between the subject and the green screen background so that the subject does not cast a shadow on the green screen. This distance is also important to place lights in between so that the green screen is perfectly lit for a great video shooting session.</p><p><strong>Quality</strong> – You should opt for a high-quality green screen cloth for the background. This means the green screen should have a solid color instead of light and dark patches here and there. Besides, you should ensure that there are no wrinkles on the green screen.</p><p>Otherwise, when you will apply green screen effect through the video editor, the transformation will be uneven. You have to spend a lot of time adjusting the parameters to cover up uneven patches in the background.</p><p><strong>Lighting</strong> – The way you set up your lights plays a major role in shooting green screen video perfectly. The light falling on the green screen will light up the screen evenly so that there are no light and dark patches. Transforming the green screen in the video editor will become that much easier.</p><p>You should focus on soft and even lighting for the entire green screen, and you should check through your camera to ensure the lighting is perfect. Sometimes, you can place lights behind the subject if the subject is staying stationary throughout the video. Otherwise, you can place the light above the subject for even distribution.</p><p><strong>Aperture</strong> – The settings of your camera are equally important to smoothen out the green screen in the background and focus on the subject sharply. That is where aperture comes into the scene, and you need to use low aperture while shooting green screen videos. Low aperture opens up the camera lens, and the green screen turns softer in the background. The subject stands out while the background turns uniformly green.</p><p><strong>Shutter Speed</strong> – While shooting a green screen video, you should keep a high shutter speed to prevent motion blur and uneven background. If the subject stays fixed throughout, the shutter speed should be double the frame rate. If the subject is moving throughout, the shutter speed should be around 4 times the frame rate such as 1&#x2F;100.</p><p><strong>ISO</strong> – The last thing you want in a green screen video is grainy footage. Your life will turn upside down editing the video and getting the green screen effect perfectly in any video editor. ISO determines the sensitivity and thereby, the grainy effect in your video.

Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don’t need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.</p><p>Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you’re on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don’t have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we’ve put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you’ll need to know to make stunning films, even if you’ve never done it before. We’ll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS"></a><strong>Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS</strong></h2><p>OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It’s open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.</p><p><strong>Step 1. Download and Install OBS</strong></p><p>Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.</p><p><strong>Step 2. Setup Screen Recording</strong></p><p>The window is divided into separate parts called “docks” when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you’ll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-setup-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="obs setup screen recording"                ></p><p>You’ll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).</p><p><strong>Step 3. Customize the Recording Source</strong></p><p>You’ll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select “Display Capture” by clicking the “+” icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click “OK”. At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-customize-the-recording-source.jpg"                      alt="obs customize the recording source"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4. Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p><p>You’ll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you’re ready to begin recording. When you’re finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-start-stop-recording.jpg"                      alt="obs start stop recording"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The sensitivity level determines the size of the pause. Thus, a lower sensitivity level records longer pauses. You can fine-tune three crucial Filmora Silence Detection settings in this step.</p><p>First, you should adjust the volume threshold to fix a specific value for silence. This parameter tells the algorithm how loud you want it to be before it becomes annoying. By default, 25% is the volume threshold. It implies that the software will consider segments silent if their volume threshold value is less than 25%.</p><p> Now, you should adjust the Minimum Duration option. It tells Filmora how long a period of quiet or low-volume sound should be. Just 0.5 seconds is the default minimum duration. In other words, for 0.5 seconds to be considered quiet, there must be no sound.</p><p> You can also set the Softening Buffer value. This setting allows you to add a little delay before and after audible parts begin and finish. With 0.1s set as the default, the softening buffer starts to work. It implies that the beginning and end of the audible parts may each have their own 0.1-second buffering time.</p><h5 id="Step4Eliminate-Any-Found-Silences"><a href="#Step4Eliminate-Any-Found-Silences" class="headerlink" title="Step4Eliminate Any Found Silences "></a>Step4Eliminate Any Found Silences <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step4.jpg"                      alt="choose analyze option"                ></h5><p>Hit the “Analyze” button after you’re happy with the settings.

Instead, to fly objects in our videos, we will use simple techniques that you may also be familiar with.</p><h3 id="Video-Cameras"><a href="#Video-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="Video Cameras"></a>Video Cameras</h3><p>The camera, in this scenario, will be the essential accessory as it will capture your video with the proper aspect ratio. This video camera can now be from a mobile phone or a high-quality DSLR. It will all depend upon your preference for quality and frame rate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/dslr-camera.jpg"                      alt="dslr camera"                ></p><h3 id="Tri-Pod"><a href="#Tri-Pod" class="headerlink" title="Tri-Pod"></a>Tri-Pod</h3><p>Selecting the Tri-Pod is also crucial to your quality of video taking as it will ensure stability while capturing the video from the camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/tri-pod-stand.jpg"                      alt="tri pod stand"                ></p><p>Stability is the key here, as the captured videos will be masked and combined in the later stages of the steps. To do so, consistently capturing the video in the same ratio is necessary. You can stabilize the video with a simple gorilla pod that you can get of good quality or a simple tripod.</p><h3 id="The-prop"><a href="#The-prop" class="headerlink" title="The prop"></a>The prop</h3><p>The prop will be the object that we will be flying in the video.

Then you might have seen the actors and the stunt workers hanging from big ropes performing stunts in front of green screens.</p><p>Well, the directors capture the video in real-time. But they can do those big stunts on TV with editing and CGI, and one of the effects is “<strong>Masking</strong>.”</p><p>The masking effect allows you to mask the object on the screen with a reference video.

The software functions effectively on Mac, Windows, and Linux computers.</p><p>Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) is free and open-source software that allows users to record videos and live stream events right at their comfort. The software functions effectively on Mac, Windows, and Linux computers.</p><p>Since its initial launch in 2012, OBS has made tremendous moves – This is not only from the constant release of its new versions but also the relentless increase in the functionality features. Besides, OBS is equipped with a robust API that enables plugins and scripts which provide extensive customization to precisely suit one’s needs.</p><p>However, OBS being a free application can function to date due to enough support from sponsors and backers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Apply-Color-Correction-in-OBS-3"><a href="#How-to-Apply-Color-Correction-in-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Apply Color Correction in OBS"></a>How to Apply Color Correction in OBS</h2><p>When you carry out basic edits to your videos or images with OBS and realize that your project has poor shade, color, or tone, you don’t have to export it to another software to correct it. Instead, you can use filters for color correction in OBS.</p><p>Apart from using OBS filters to color correct video clips and images, you can correct games, browser sources, and video capture devices.</p><p>There are various aspects of color correction in OBS. It includes:</p><h4 id="1-Gamma-3"><a href="#1-Gamma-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Gamma"></a>1. Gamma</h4><p>Gamma is a fundamental aspect in OBS that functions by balancing the brightness of an image through contrast. To be precise, Gamma works almost similarly to change in brightness while simultaneously increasing or decreasing the contrast.</p><p>In editing, Gamma is applicable mainly for removing shiny foreheads and webcam footage in gaming and browsing.</p><p>High Gamma is represented by “L,” whereas low Gamm is represented by “R.”</p><h4 id="2-Contrast-3"><a href="#2-Contrast-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Contrast"></a>2. Contrast</h4><p>Contrast is the difference in the degree of colors and tones in an image. Usually, the low contrast image has a narrow color range, whereas the high contrast images have dark shadows and bright highlights.</p><p>“L” represents high contrast in OBS contrast, whereas “R” represents low contrast.</p><h4 id="3-Brightness-3"><a href="#3-Brightness-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Brightness"></a>3. Brightness</h4><p>Brightness is the degree to how light or dark a picture is. To be able to understand an image clearly, it is best to correct its brightness. A change in brightness of a picture has a simultaneous change in pixels of that image.</p><p>High brightness in OBS is denounced by the letter “L,” whereas Low brightness is denounced by “R.”</p><h4 id="4-Saturation-3"><a href="#4-Saturation-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Saturation"></a>4. Saturation</h4><p>Saturation is the intensity of colors in a video or an image. High saturated images are bright, strong, and are rich, whereas the low saturated photos appear washed out. Black and white (grayscale) photos have no color saturation. In OBS, high saturation and low saturation are represented as “L” and “R.”</p><h4 id="5-Hue-Shift-3"><a href="#5-Hue-Shift-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Hue Shift"></a>5. Hue Shift</h4><p>Hue shift is the change in an image’s saturation, lightness, and hue colors. Hue shifting occurs when highlighting or shading images. In OBS, you can use the hue shift functionality to reimage your image with a completely different color palette.</p><p>With the hue shift functionality in OBS, you can place the image on top of another and have an 80% opacity. It means that you will still see the first image when you place the second one on top of it.</p><p>The “L” sign in the OBS hue shift represents 50% opacity, while the “R” represents 100% Opacity.</p><h2 id="Color-Grade-in-OBS-3"><a href="#Color-Grade-in-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="Color Grade in OBS"></a>Color Grade in OBS</h2><p>Color grading is the process of enhancing the appearance of an image through attributes such as contrast, saturation, and color, making them enchanting for presentations. Color grading is not only done for still images but also for motion pictures and images.</p><p>Color grading functionality in OBS is encompassed with several tools – This includes:</p><h4 id="1-Lift-tool-3"><a href="#1-Lift-tool-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Lift tool"></a>1. Lift tool</h4><p>As the name suggests, lift tools are used in lifting or removing specific colors from an image. It does so without necessarily affecting other colors in an image.</p><p>With this tool, you can selectively remove unwanted colors from your image or video, replace them with your desired ones, and create astonishing results.</p><h4 id="2-Offset-3"><a href="#2-Offset-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Offset"></a>2. Offset</h4><p>Offset is another outstanding tool in OBS color grading that controls the blacks&#x2F;Shadows of an image. It functions by altering the brightness levels and leaving the highlights and the mid-tones unaffected.</p><h4 id="3-Gain-3"><a href="#3-Gain-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Gain"></a>3. Gain</h4><p>A gain is a tool in OBS color correction that functions by only adjusting the white levels in an image. With the gain tool, brighter colors become brighter or darker.</p><p>Many people, especially beginner editors, experience difficulty differentiating between the Gamma and Offset tools. Yes, there is a closer similarity between the two, and for you to be on the safe side, you need to know that Gamma goes with the mid-tones (middle gray levels) whereas the Gain goes with highlights&#x2F;whites.</p><h2 id="How-to-Apply-LUTs-in-OBS-3"><a href="#How-to-Apply-LUTs-in-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Apply LUTs in OBS"></a>How to Apply LUTs in OBS</h2><p>Look up tables (LUTs) is a functionality feature that allows editors, colorists, and filmmakers to save certain colors as their templates.

A thumbnail is a small image inserted into a video that exemplifies larger content inside the video or article. Millions of videos are produced and uploaded on the Internet every single day, so it’s essential for yours to stand out. Text on videos has several different added benefits as well. In this video, we’ll give four reasons why you should start adding text to your videos.</p><h3 id="1-Content-becomes-easy-to-remember"><a href="#1-Content-becomes-easy-to-remember" class="headerlink" title="1. Content becomes easy to remember"></a><strong>1. Content becomes easy to remember</strong></h3><p>Viewer Retention (sometimes referred to as “Audience Retention”) is the average percentage of a video that people watch. Videos with high Viewer Retention scores tend to sell more. Adding some Text&#x2F;Title in your video is one of the critical factors to remember because the viewers get multiple cue points (example: audio and text on video) to confirm their understanding and retain the essence of the messaging.</p><h3 id="2-Make-sense-even-without-sound"><a href="#2-Make-sense-even-without-sound" class="headerlink" title="2.

A recent study indicates that 85% of Facebook videos are watched without sound. A lot of us consume videos while in transit and sometimes at work as well :).</p><p>Text is very expository for most of these videos since it’d help in building the proper context for the viewer.</p><h3 id="3-It-Helps-Summarize-Key-Points"><a href="#3-It-Helps-Summarize-Key-Points" class="headerlink" title="3. It Helps Summarize Key Points"></a><strong>3. It Helps Summarize Key Points</strong></h3><p>Some audiences are looking for a summary of the video in an instant to save more time. As Youtuber, it is very helpful if you will add Text&#x2F;Titles as caption perse in a video. For example, one needs to remember 2-3 tips for driving. If the captions or text show up on the video when the driver talks about this and that, that’s better!</p><h3 id="4-Aesthetics"><a href="#4-Aesthetics" class="headerlink" title="4. Aesthetics"></a><strong>4. Aesthetics</strong></h3><p>Some people don’t care much about the graphics; they just go through the textual content. This is because texts are the major sources of information. Adding Styling Text&#x2F;Titles can make a video engaging and attractive.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="5-Methods-to-Denoise-a-Video"><a href="#5-Methods-to-Denoise-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="5 Methods to Denoise a Video"></a>5 Methods to Denoise a Video</h2><p>In today’s world, the quality of digital product such as photos and videos increase day by day, prompting us to create our content crystal clear and keep it that way. Of course, different kinds of effects and filters are great, and something called “noise” is one of them, but sometimes it is actually unwanted and makes our footage less likable. What is noise, or denoising, anyway? Well, instead of clear video, it’s something quite different – the footage looks grainy, sometimes excessively, and makes our eyes hurt, or simply, more difficult to see what’s going on on the screen. And if you didn’t decide to use a noise effect, then from where does it appear?..</p><p>Noise means a mix of different variations of brightness or color information in the shot. It is likely to show up when there is a low light, and&#x2F;or when the video is taken with small sensors such as smartphones and action cameras. It works as follows: if someone tries to compensate for low-light settings with gain and ISO, more noise is produced.</p><p>But, as our readers already know, almost nothing is ever impossible to solve. There is a way to get rid of this annoying grain, and it is called, as pretty obvious, denoising. Hence, denoising in image and video production is used as a technique to take footage from grainy to crystal-clear. And, as you may already agree, it improves a viewer’s quality of experience. And how does this happen? - There are varied techniques, and each of them uses different mathematical and statistical models.</p><p>What is considered a good noise reduction? The technique is successful when it suppresses noise effectively in uniform regions; preserves edges and other characteristics, such as fine details and textures; and provides a visually natural experience.</p><p>and here you will learn 5 ways, as in 5 software to denoise a video. We’ll touch upon the following ones: Final Cut Pro, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve and Movavi Video Editor. But, we are not limited to these ones, so maybe there is one more you could use? You’ll find out in the article!</p><ul><li><strong>Final Cut Pro</strong></li></ul><p>Noise that appears as unwanted grain or artifacts in the video image can be removed in Final Cut Pro pretty easily, you just have to follow the little steps for it. Keep in mind that Final Cut Pro is not eligible for PC, this editor is only available for Mac (but Windows users, tune in for the editors functioning on PC’s!)</p><p>So, you have your grained footage, which you already chose to denoise, and for which you will need a video reduction effect.</p><p>First, you will need to open Final Cut Pro and import abovementioned video. Select this clip in the timeline,</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-1.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>and position the play head in a way that the clip appears in the viewer, that is, on the big screen - for you to see well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-2.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>Click the Effects button in the top-right corner of the timeline, or, to use the shortcut, press Command &amp; 5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-3.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>In the Effects browser, select the Basics category in the list of Video effects on the left, then select the Noise Reduction effect. For 360° clips, select the 360° category, then select the 360° Noise Reduction effect.</p><p>And you will need to do one of the following:</p><p>Drag the effect to the timeline clip you want to apply it to, or double-click the effect thumbnail to apply the effect to the selected clip.</p><p>When the effect is applied, Final Cut Pro analyzes the clip for noise, so you might need to wait for a little while the process is complete and only then see the result.</p><p>Interesting tip you can remember is that if you are using several effects to your video clip, then adding Noise Reduction as the first effect would guarantee the best results for you. So, Mac users, you can start denoising your videos in Final Cut Pro now!</p><ul><li><strong>Adobe After Effects</strong></li></ul><p>Adobe After Effects is a digital visual effects, motion graphics, and compositing application… Pretty intense, right? This very software has endless powers, and one of them is, you guessed correctly – denoising the video! So, how are we going to do that in this monster of the industry?</p><p>Sometimes what’s annoying about this kind of programs is that you need plugins, so let’s try to find a way to achieve our desired result without using anything external.</p><p>So, first of all (as in all cases!) import your video into After Effects. Then, you will need to find Effect in the menu, and find: Noise and Grain. There, you will choose Remove Grain and click on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-4.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>On the left side of the program layout, the Effects Control will be opened. Now, you see viewing mode, where you need to change Preview to Final Output.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-5.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>So, this will be the video with Preview checked:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-6.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>Which will look like this when Final Output is checked:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-7.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>Somewhat different and looking better, right?..</p><p>By the way, you can watch the whole process video <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8pqSysA90" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>!</p><ul><li><strong>Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></li></ul><p>Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most and sophisticated video editor. So, of course, there is a way to reduce noise in this software as well, and this can be reached using effect called Median.</p><p>First of all, you add your footage to the Timeline in Premiere Pro and then go find the Effects Panel, where Median can be found. You need to drag and drop the Median effect to your video clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-8.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>The next step is to make sure that adding the effect to the grainiest parts of the clip, which can be done using masks. So, in the Effects Control panel, you’ll need to select the mask shape for your clip – you can either choose rectangle, circle, or pen tool. With the latter you can move the Mask around the screen and resize it to cover the area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-9.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>And if you Change the Feather setting to 100, the effect will not have a very visible edge and some smoothness will cover for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-10.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>You will need to repeat the process with more than one mask, if you would like to have covered all of the grainy area of your shot.</p><p>Lastly, you’ll need to adjust the effect settings to reduce the noise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-11.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>The Median effect doesn’t actually take away the graininess, it just blurs it. You’ll need to experiment with the Radius settings until you are happy with the result.</p><ul><li><strong>DaVinci Resolve</strong></li></ul><p>When it comes to DaVinci Resolve, the process is somewhat different in the free version of it. So, first of all, off course, you add your footage into the timeline. Then,you are going to find the fusion tab underneath the timeline panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-12.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>You will see MediaIn1 and MediaOut1, you click on MediaIn1, which will ensure the scene appears in the first viewer – and MediaOut1 by default is appearing in the second. So, now you stay on MediaIn1, hit shift+spacebar, and find the option which says: Remove Noise (RN) and then click Add, which adds the Remove Noise1 node. On the top right corner you will find Inspector, and if you click on it, you will see all the properties you can modify.</p><p>After going only into the second viewer, and in the top bar we can find channel icons. We open it and click on red, which makes the footage black and white for a while. Then, we go back to the Inspector, increase Softness Red and Detail Red.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-13.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>This removes much grain from the red channel. Then we repeat the same for green, as well as for blue channel. Once you finish, you go to the same channel button in the bar and change it to “back to color”. So, the footage will have its colors back and you will see that it has become clearer, compared to the first viewer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-14.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>You can play around with the Chroma and Luma channels in the Inspector, if that is something you have ever had experience with!</p><ul><li><strong>Movavi Video Editor</strong></li></ul><p>In Movavi Video Editor, it is pretty straightforward – unlike DaVinci Resolve, of course! So, getting to the point: the first thing you need to do is Entering the Edit Mode. In order to achieve it, you’ll need to click the Edit button next to the file you want to adjust or select Adjustments in the Tools tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-15.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>After this, you will be able to select the Noise removal option, and then, move the Noise level slider to reflect the amount of noise you can see in the preview. The more noise you need to remove, the higher the Noise level, and vice versa.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-16.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>When you’re finished removing the noise, click Apply, but in case you need to remove noise from several files, select Apply to all files, which ensures the same noise level will be applied on all your files there.</p><p>Lastly, of course, Wondershare Filmora X offers the same option as well. The steps are ase follows: You need to go to the Effects panel and type: “Smart Denoise”. Then, right-click on the video and choose Edit Properties.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-17.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>This will make sure you go inside the Smart Denoise, where you can change opacity of the clip, threshold and radius.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-18.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>You should reduce Opacity until you are satisfied with the result. Then, you can use the box next to Smart Denoise in order to see the scene before and after noise and grain removal.</p><p>So, that’s it! – We learned how to remove&#x2F;reduce noise and grain from the videos, using several video editors. So you might as well start making your video clips look better right away!</p><p>Noise that appears as unwanted grain or artifacts in the video image can be removed in Final Cut Pro pretty easily, you just have to follow the little steps for it. Keep in mind that Final Cut Pro is not eligible for PC, this editor is only available for Mac (but Windows users, tune in for the editors functioning on PC’s!)</p><p>So, you have your grained footage, which you already chose to denoise, and for which you will need a video reduction effect.</p><p>First, you will need to open Final Cut Pro and import abovementioned video. Select this clip in the timeline,</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-1.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>and position the play head in a way that the clip appears in the viewer, that is, on the big screen - for you to see well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-2.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>Click the Effects button in the top-right corner of the timeline, or, to use the shortcut, press Command &amp; 5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-3.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>In the Effects browser, select the Basics category in the list of Video effects on the left, then select the Noise Reduction effect. For 360° clips, select the 360° category, then select the 360° Noise Reduction effect.</p><p>And you will need to do one of the following:</p><p>Drag the effect to the timeline clip you want to apply it to, or double-click the effect thumbnail to apply the effect to the selected clip.</p><p>When the effect is applied, Final Cut Pro analyzes the clip for noise, so you might need to wait for a little while the process is complete and only then see the result.</p><p>Interesting tip you can remember is that if you are using several effects to your video clip, then adding Noise Reduction as the first effect would guarantee the best results for you. So, Mac users, you can start denoising your videos in Final Cut Pro now!</p><ul><li><strong>Adobe After Effects</strong></li></ul><p>Adobe After Effects is a digital visual effects, motion graphics, and compositing application… Pretty intense, right? This very software has endless powers, and one of them is, you guessed correctly – denoising the video! So, how are we going to do that in this monster of the industry?</p><p>Sometimes what’s annoying about this kind of programs is that you need plugins, so let’s try to find a way to achieve our desired result without using anything external.</p><p>So, first of all (as in all cases!) import your video into After Effects. Then, you will need to find Effect in the menu, and find: Noise and Grain. There, you will choose Remove Grain and click on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-4.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>On the left side of the program layout, the Effects Control will be opened.

So, of course, there is a way to reduce noise in this software as well, and this can be reached using effect called Median.</p><p>First of all, you add your footage to the Timeline in Premiere Pro and then go find the Effects Panel, where Median can be found. You need to drag and drop the Median effect to your video clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-8.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>The next step is to make sure that adding the effect to the grainiest parts of the clip, which can be done using masks. So, in the Effects Control panel, you’ll need to select the mask shape for your clip – you can either choose rectangle, circle, or pen tool. With the latter you can move the Mask around the screen and resize it to cover the area.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-9.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>And if you Change the Feather setting to 100, the effect will not have a very visible edge and some smoothness will cover for it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-10.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>You will need to repeat the process with more than one mask, if you would like to have covered all of the grainy area of your shot.</p><p>Lastly, you’ll need to adjust the effect settings to reduce the noise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-11.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>The Median effect doesn’t actually take away the graininess, it just blurs it. You’ll need to experiment with the Radius settings until you are happy with the result.</p><ul><li><strong>DaVinci Resolve</strong></li></ul><p>When it comes to DaVinci Resolve, the process is somewhat different in the free version of it. So, first of all, off course, you add your footage into the timeline. Then,you are going to find the fusion tab underneath the timeline panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-12.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>You will see MediaIn1 and MediaOut1, you click on MediaIn1, which will ensure the scene appears in the first viewer – and MediaOut1 by default is appearing in the second. So, now you stay on MediaIn1, hit shift+spacebar, and find the option which says: Remove Noise (RN) and then click Add, which adds the Remove Noise1 node. On the top right corner you will find Inspector, and if you click on it, you will see all the properties you can modify.</p><p>After going only into the second viewer, and in the top bar we can find channel icons. We open it and click on red, which makes the footage black and white for a while. Then, we go back to the Inspector, increase Softness Red and Detail Red.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-13.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>This removes much grain from the red channel. Then we repeat the same for green, as well as for blue channel. Once you finish, you go to the same channel button in the bar and change it to “back to color”. So, the footage will have its colors back and you will see that it has become clearer, compared to the first viewer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-14.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>You can play around with the Chroma and Luma channels in the Inspector, if that is something you have ever had experience with!</p><ul><li><strong>Movavi Video Editor</strong></li></ul><p>In Movavi Video Editor, it is pretty straightforward – unlike DaVinci Resolve, of course!

You’ll need to experiment with the Radius settings until you are happy with the result.</p><ul><li><strong>DaVinci Resolve</strong></li></ul><p>When it comes to DaVinci Resolve, the process is somewhat different in the free version of it. So, first of all, off course, you add your footage into the timeline. Then,you are going to find the fusion tab underneath the timeline panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-12.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>You will see MediaIn1 and MediaOut1, you click on MediaIn1, which will ensure the scene appears in the first viewer – and MediaOut1 by default is appearing in the second. So, now you stay on MediaIn1, hit shift+spacebar, and find the option which says: Remove Noise (RN) and then click Add, which adds the Remove Noise1 node. On the top right corner you will find Inspector, and if you click on it, you will see all the properties you can modify.</p><p>After going only into the second viewer, and in the top bar we can find channel icons. We open it and click on red, which makes the footage black and white for a while. Then, we go back to the Inspector, increase Softness Red and Detail Red.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-13.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>This removes much grain from the red channel. Then we repeat the same for green, as well as for blue channel. Once you finish, you go to the same channel button in the bar and change it to “back to color”. So, the footage will have its colors back and you will see that it has become clearer, compared to the first viewer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-14.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>You can play around with the Chroma and Luma channels in the Inspector, if that is something you have ever had experience with!</p><ul><li><strong>Movavi Video Editor</strong></li></ul><p>In Movavi Video Editor, it is pretty straightforward – unlike DaVinci Resolve, of course! So, getting to the point: the first thing you need to do is Entering the Edit Mode. In order to achieve it, you’ll need to click the Edit button next to the file you want to adjust or select Adjustments in the Tools tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-15.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>After this, you will be able to select the Noise removal option, and then, move the Noise level slider to reflect the amount of noise you can see in the preview. The more noise you need to remove, the higher the Noise level, and vice versa.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-16.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>When you’re finished removing the noise, click Apply, but in case you need to remove noise from several files, select Apply to all files, which ensures the same noise level will be applied on all your files there.</p><p>Lastly, of course, Wondershare Filmora X offers the same option as well. The steps are ase follows: You need to go to the Effects panel and type: “Smart Denoise”. Then, right-click on the video and choose Edit Properties.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-17.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>This will make sure you go inside the Smart Denoise, where you can change opacity of the clip, threshold and radius.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-18.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>You should reduce Opacity until you are satisfied with the result. Then, you can use the box next to Smart Denoise in order to see the scene before and after noise and grain removal.</p><p>So, that’s it! – We learned how to remove&#x2F;reduce noise and grain from the videos, using several video editors. So you might as well start making your video clips look better right away!</p><p>Noise that appears as unwanted grain or artifacts in the video image can be removed in Final Cut Pro pretty easily, you just have to follow the little steps for it. Keep in mind that Final Cut Pro is not eligible for PC, this editor is only available for Mac (but Windows users, tune in for the editors functioning on PC’s!)</p><p>So, you have your grained footage, which you already chose to denoise, and for which you will need a video reduction effect.</p><p>First, you will need to open Final Cut Pro and import abovementioned video. Select this clip in the timeline,</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-1.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>and position the play head in a way that the clip appears in the viewer, that is, on the big screen - for you to see well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-2.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>Click the Effects button in the top-right corner of the timeline, or, to use the shortcut, press Command &amp; 5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-3.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>In the Effects browser, select the Basics category in the list of Video effects on the left, then select the Noise Reduction effect. For 360° clips, select the 360° category, then select the 360° Noise Reduction effect.</p><p>And you will need to do one of the following:</p><p>Drag the effect to the timeline clip you want to apply it to, or double-click the effect thumbnail to apply the effect to the selected clip.</p><p>When the effect is applied, Final Cut Pro analyzes the clip for noise, so you might need to wait for a little while the process is complete and only then see the result.</p><p>Interesting tip you can remember is that if you are using several effects to your video clip, then adding Noise Reduction as the first effect would guarantee the best results for you. So, Mac users, you can start denoising your videos in Final Cut Pro now!</p><ul><li><strong>Adobe After Effects</strong></li></ul><p>Adobe After Effects is a digital visual effects, motion graphics, and compositing application… Pretty intense, right? This very software has endless powers, and one of them is, you guessed correctly – denoising the video! So, how are we going to do that in this monster of the industry?</p><p>Sometimes what’s annoying about this kind of programs is that you need plugins, so let’s try to find a way to achieve our desired result without using anything external.</p><p>So, first of all (as in all cases!) import your video into After Effects. Then, you will need to find Effect in the menu, and find: Noise and Grain. There, you will choose Remove Grain and click on it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-4.jpg"                      alt="denoise-a-video"                ></p><p>On the left side of the program layout, the Effects Control will be opened.

It is available for purchase. The plug-in gives users the ability to speed up, slow down, or convert the frame rate of picture sequences, all with special effects. Twixtor can visually estimate what a video is meant to look like in a slow-motion setting using video analysis and interoperability.</p><p>Due to the need for unparalleled image quality, RE: Vision Effects developed unique tracking technology that determines every individual pixel’s motion. This technology allows Twixtor to synthesize new innovative frames by warping and interpolating frames from the original sequence, resulting in unprecedented image quality.</p><p>Reset the clock to a single-speed setting. Always remember that you can customize the retiming on a frame-by-frame basis!</p><p>When items are crossing in the scene, Twixtor is more accurate and shows fewer artifacts than other rendering engines. This reduces the ripping and stretching of items when they cross the frame or exit it completely.</p><p>But how does Twixtor work is the million-dollar question! While Premiere includes the ability to slow down your film and has a newer, better-quality version dubbed Optical Flow, it cannot zoom in on your footage (called Pixel Motion in After Effects).</p><p>The slow-motion quality is undoubtedly superior to that of simple frame blending, but it is not the finest grade slow motion available. The TWIXTOR from Re: Vision Effects has long been the go-to solution for the most excellent post-slow motion. It is pricey, but it is well worth it.</p><p>The Pro edition provides you with the opportunity to fine-tune the pitch of the auto track, as well as the option to employ mattes and alphas to enrich your tracks and the ability to deal with motion vectors from a 3D system, among other features.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Twixtor-to-Create-Super-Slow-Mo-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Twixtor-to-Create-Super-Slow-Mo-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Twixtor to Create Super Slow-Mo in Adobe Premiere Pro?"></a>Part 2: How to Use Twixtor to Create Super Slow-Mo in Adobe Premiere Pro?</h2><p>As we’ve already mentioned, we will be analyzing how Twixtor makes slow mos; we will be starting with the Adobe Premiere Pro. The following are the steps you need to learn to perform it yourself.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: After importing the video to the timeline, do some basic editing such as trimming and removing audio from the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nest-sequence-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="nest sequence premiere pro"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Nest the sequence to convert the video into a new sequence automatically.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to the Effects tab and search for Twixtor, and then drop the Twixtor Pro to the video clip in the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twixtor-pro-effect-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="twixtor pro effect premiere pro"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Right-click the video in the timeline again and scroll down to <strong>Show Clip Keyframes</strong> to enable the <strong>Speed</strong> option under <strong>Time Remapping</strong>. You can now enable the GPU acceleration to fast rendering.</p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click the Keyframe icon to mark the points where you want to begin with the slow-motion effect, and then mark the end part of the slow-motion effect video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-keyframes-to-slow-motion-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="add keyframes to slow motion premiere pro"                ></p><p>Step 7: Now, drag the line lower to add a slo-mo effect to video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-line-to-slow-motion-twixtor-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="drag line to slow motion twixtor premiere pro"                ></p><p>Remember that your video can sometimes lag if you set the video speed at a meager percentage.

Before we begin our study of the Twixtor plug-in, let us get acquainted with the software’s operating screen to quickly understand the content of this article as we go through our assessment of the Twixtor plug-in.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you launch <strong>After Effects</strong>, go to <strong>File&gt;Import&gt;File</strong> to import your footage. Here you can see the actual frame rate of your film. You may drag your film onto the timeline by right-clicking it and selecting <strong>New Comp from Selection</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select your video from the timeline in the composition, then go to Effects &amp; Presets pane to search Twixtor, and you will find Twixtor or Twixtor Pro under RE: Vision plug-ins, depending on your version. Drag and drop it to the video in the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-twixtor-slow-motion-plugin.jpg"                      alt="after effects twixtor slow motion plugin"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: In the Twixtor effect controls, enter the frame rate of the film you found previously. The faster and better your slowed footage will become, the higher the frame rate.</p><p>For organizational reasons, After Effects employs the “<strong>tree-ing</strong>“ concept, sometimes known as drop-down menus.

Twixtor can visually estimate what a video is meant to look like in a slow-motion setting using video analysis and interoperability.</p><p>Due to the need for unparalleled image quality, RE: Vision Effects developed unique tracking technology that determines every individual pixel’s motion. This technology allows Twixtor to synthesize new innovative frames by warping and interpolating frames from the original sequence, resulting in unprecedented image quality.</p><p>Reset the clock to a single-speed setting. Always remember that you can customize the retiming on a frame-by-frame basis!</p><p>When items are crossing in the scene, Twixtor is more accurate and shows fewer artifacts than other rendering engines. This reduces the ripping and stretching of items when they cross the frame or exit it completely.</p><p>But how does Twixtor work is the million-dollar question! While Premiere includes the ability to slow down your film and has a newer, better-quality version dubbed Optical Flow, it cannot zoom in on your footage (called Pixel Motion in After Effects).</p><p>The slow-motion quality is undoubtedly superior to that of simple frame blending, but it is not the finest grade slow motion available. The TWIXTOR from Re: Vision Effects has long been the go-to solution for the most excellent post-slow motion. It is pricey, but it is well worth it.</p><p>The Pro edition provides you with the opportunity to fine-tune the pitch of the auto track, as well as the option to employ mattes and alphas to enrich your tracks and the ability to deal with motion vectors from a 3D system, among other features.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Twixtor-to-Create-Super-Slow-Mo-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Twixtor-to-Create-Super-Slow-Mo-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Twixtor to Create Super Slow-Mo in Adobe Premiere Pro?"></a>Part 2: How to Use Twixtor to Create Super Slow-Mo in Adobe Premiere Pro?</h2><p>As we’ve already mentioned, we will be analyzing how Twixtor makes slow mos; we will be starting with the Adobe Premiere Pro. The following are the steps you need to learn to perform it yourself.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: After importing the video to the timeline, do some basic editing such as trimming and removing audio from the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nest-sequence-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="nest sequence premiere pro"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Nest the sequence to convert the video into a new sequence automatically.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to the Effects tab and search for Twixtor, and then drop the Twixtor Pro to the video clip in the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twixtor-pro-effect-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="twixtor pro effect premiere pro"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Right-click the video in the timeline again and scroll down to <strong>Show Clip Keyframes</strong> to enable the <strong>Speed</strong> option under <strong>Time Remapping</strong>. You can now enable the GPU acceleration to fast rendering.</p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click the Keyframe icon to mark the points where you want to begin with the slow-motion effect, and then mark the end part of the slow-motion effect video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-keyframes-to-slow-motion-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="add keyframes to slow motion premiere pro"                ></p><p>Step 7: Now, drag the line lower to add a slo-mo effect to video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-line-to-slow-motion-twixtor-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="drag line to slow motion twixtor premiere pro"                ></p><p>Remember that your video can sometimes lag if you set the video speed at a meager percentage. To avoid that, utilize settings in a better way to ensure your video works flawlessly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-Super-Slow-Motion-in-After-Effects-with-Twixtor-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-Super-Slow-Motion-in-After-Effects-with-Twixtor-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Create Super Slow Motion in After Effects with Twixtor?"></a>Part 3: How to Create Super Slow Motion in After Effects with Twixtor?</h2><p>When working with After Effects software, Twixtor is a convenient plug-in since it allows us to create slow-motion effects from any video source.</p><p>We’ll look at an example to better comprehend what we’re talking about in this post. Before we begin our study of the Twixtor plug-in, let us get acquainted with the software’s operating screen to quickly understand the content of this article as we go through our assessment of the Twixtor plug-in.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you launch <strong>After Effects</strong>, go to <strong>File&gt;Import&gt;File</strong> to import your footage. Here you can see the actual frame rate of your film. You may drag your film onto the timeline by right-clicking it and selecting <strong>New Comp from Selection</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select your video from the timeline in the composition, then go to Effects &amp; Presets pane to search Twixtor, and you will find Twixtor or Twixtor Pro under RE: Vision plug-ins, depending on your version. Drag and drop it to the video in the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-twixtor-slow-motion-plugin.jpg"                      alt="after effects twixtor slow motion plugin"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: In the Twixtor effect controls, enter the frame rate of the film you found previously. The faster and better your slowed footage will become, the higher the frame rate.</p><p>For organizational reasons, After Effects employs the “<strong>tree-ing</strong>“ concept, sometimes known as drop-down menus. Click on the yellow number next to Input: Frame Rate under <strong>Source Control</strong>. It should be set to 29.97 by default. Please set it to the frame rate you discovered previously in the tutorial.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-after-effects-twixtor-pro-settings.jpg"                      alt="adjust after effects twixtor pro settings"                ></p><p>You can then adjust the speed and time remap mode accordingly. For more information, you can watch the video tutorial below to find out how to create smooth Twixtor effects in Adobe After Effects.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Get-the-Twixtor-Style-Effect-on-iPhone-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Get-the-Twixtor-Style-Effect-on-iPhone-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Get the Twixtor Style Effect on iPhone?"></a>Part 4: How to Get the Twixtor Style Effect on iPhone?</h2><p>It is possible to shoot videos in slow motion and then play them back at average speed using <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slopro/id507232505" >SloPro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – 1000fps Slow Motion Video from Sand Mountain Studios, a fantastic video editing effects tool.</p><p>Inserting slow motion cues and changing playback speeds without waiting is possible with renderless editing. It allows you to produce slow-motion films and enables you to insert extremely rapid sequences and cycle between various speeds.</p><p>SloPro even enables you to edit your films as they are being recorded, allowing you to choose between slow and fast motion while recording.</p><p>This program provides complete support for sharing through social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, allowing you to show off your impressive video creations to the rest of the world. It has already been established that SloPro is one of the few videos editing software that includes optical flow as a stand-alone effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slopro-slow-motion-app-iphone.jpg"                      alt="slopro slow motion app iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: After you’ve imported your video, click on the <strong>red Edit</strong> button in the top-right corner of the screen to bring up the editing window.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Trim the video down to the section that you wish to modify if required using the <strong>Clip In</strong> and <strong>Clip Out</strong> functions. It is divided into clips using the speed in and speeds out controls.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Tap on the top-left box to bring up a list of fast and <strong>slow speed</strong> choices. <strong>Drag the cursor</strong> over the clip to bring up a fast and slow speed options list.</p><p>Step 4: If you want to use a slow speed, press the box in the upper right corner and choose <strong>Optical Flow</strong> from the menu.</p><p>This will render the clip with optical flow, resulting in the smooth Twixtor effect you are familiar with. There will be a watermark on your video if you use the program’s free version, but you can easily crop it out.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Slow-Mo videos are undoubtedly watch-worthy. They allow us to observe the fine details and appreciate the video content. But creating one isn’t child’s play. So, we decided to compile this article to inform our worthy readers on how they can get started using Twixtor on Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects.

Full Guide Here"></a>How to Remove Echo with Premiere Pro? Full Guide Here</h2><p>Do you want to <strong>reduce echo in Premiere Pro</strong>? How often have you been in situations where you encountered conditions where there was annoying background noise on your video? There is no need to overthink, given that everyone has to deal with this problem. Your video may become intolerable if background noise, such as the sound of a fan or the wind blowing through a window, is present. Because of this, you need to take immediate action to <strong>remove echo in Premiere Pro</strong> to accomplish the task of uploading a video to YouTube or any other social media site.</p><p>Spending a lot of time on a recording, only to have the completed work have a terrible echo, is one of the most frustrating experiences. You will be relieved that there are methods by which you may take your audio clips and modify the audio on your clips to decrease the echo. The following explains how to <strong>remove echo from audio in Premiere Pro</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-echo-premiere-pro-1.jpg"                      alt="remove echo in premiere pro"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Reduce-Echo-Noise-with-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Reduce-Echo-Noise-with-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Reduce Echo Noise with Premiere Pro"></a>Part 1: How to Reduce Echo Noise with Premiere Pro</h2><p><strong>Reducing echo in Premiere Pro</strong> is straightforward with the application’s built-in tools. It requires no additional plugins from other developers.</p><p>Step1 Deverb</p><p>The first step is to look for an effect called “DeReverb” in the Effects box of the Effects workspace. Once you find it, you can easily add it to the clip in question by dragging and dropping it there. After that, it will show in the top-left corner of the effect controls inside your audio clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-echo-premiere-pro-2.jpg"                      alt="dereverb tab"                ></p><p>Step2 Edit</p><p>Next, choose ‘Edit’ from the drop-down menu, and then set the level of DeReverb by dragging the simple slider below your clip anywhere from 0% to 100%. As you move the slider closer to 100 percent, the echo should begin to vanish almost as soon as you do!</p><p>The processing emphasis should be around the flat line unless you know the frequencies you are working with. Additionally, ensure you activate the effect by clicking the button in the upper left corner of the effect window.</p><p><em>It is vital to bear in mind that less is more when it comes to this effect since it does have a somewhat negative impact on the quality of the audio you have captured.</em> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-echo-premiere-pro-3.jpg"                      alt="edit dereverb tab"                ></p><p><strong>Further Dialing in Your Settings</strong></p><p>After you have reached a level of DeReverb that you are satisfied with, you may apply other modifications to the audio, such as compression and EQ. Still, it should already sound more distinct and more apparent at this point.</p><p>When you use the DeReverb effect to <strong>remove echo in Premiere Pro</strong>, there is one more cool thing about it. If you tick the box labeled “Auto Gain,” the volume level does not decrease as it usually would when you remove echo using this effect. Instead, the volume level maintains the same level as you go from 0 percent to 100 percent of the effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-echo-premiere-pro-4.jpg"                      alt="dial-in settings"                ></p><p>The conclusion is as follows: When you are out and about or in an ample space with many echoes, here is a super easy method to manage the echo levels!</p><p>The ‘Amount’ option in DeReverb allows users to specify the percentage of echo they wish to remove. However, use caution while adjusting this parameter since setting it too high can decrease the quality of your audio.</p><p>Also, applying the DeReverb effect may decrease the audio level; but if you mark the Auto Gain check box, Premiere Pro will compensate for the decrease in volume. Hence, it is advisable to keep the box checked since this is the default configuration. You also can tinker with the Processing Focus settings, which let you zero in on a specific frequency or frequency.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Denoise-the-Free-and-Easy-Way"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Denoise-the-Free-and-Easy-Way" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Denoise the Free and Easy Way?"></a>Part 2: How to Denoise the Free and Easy Way?</h2><p>Unparalleled videos are shared in clear voices by vloggers and filmmakers.

A video transition effect is essential whereby you connect one shot to another, especially when you are making sudden cuts in the video.

Video editing with transitions is a common practice for short videos on social media, presentation videos, and even movies.</p><p>A video transition effect is effective when you are jumping from two moods and emotions in the video. It is equally useful while jumping between storylines, points of view, and timelines. Besides, you can spice up your narrative and make your video eye-catching as well as eye-soothing.

You are using video transition effects not to distract but to smoothen the video content. Therefore, you need to be consistent with the video transition effect you use. You should use one or maximum of two transition effects throughout the video so that the audience does not get distracted.</p><p><strong>Experiment</strong> – While it is true that you should not be using too many video transitions in one video, but you should definitely apply different video transition effects in different videos initially. This will help you to understand which transition is getting better traction, and thereafter, you can stick to it for the rest of your videos.

There are 3D effects, social media effects, and different genres of effects that can go well with your video content.</p><p><strong>Judicious</strong> – There is a difference between transition effects and video effects. Transition effects should last only for a fraction of a second so that there is no aftereffect in mind. On the contrary, a video effect can last as long as required in the video. Therefore, do not stretch the duration of a transition effect and keep it as short as possible. Similarly, you should not use transition effects here and there unnecessarily. It should be used only when there is a proper scope such as scene cuts, mood changes, and subject changes.</p><p><strong>Meaningful</strong> – Even transition effect has a meaning behind it and you should understand it and use wherever appropriate. For example, fade out effect signifies the fading of a scene or changing of mood.

One of the ways we practice multilingualism is via <strong>speech-to-text technology:</strong> speakers input a language, and viewers read another language. Other advantages include converting oral speech into a document, real-time compatibility, and offline usage. This article explains how you can utilize <strong>speech-to-text assistance</strong> technology for optimal productivity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-technology.jpg"                      alt="speech to text technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-speech-to-text-technology"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-speech-to-text-technology" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is speech-to-text technology?"></a>Part 1: What is speech-to-text technology?</h2><p>Speech-to-text technology (STT) identifies oral pronunciation and converts them into computer codes: electronic words. The computer electro-communication requires a medium of conversion: receiver and interpreter. Therefore, speech-to-text technology contains both the receiver and interpreter, which exist electronically. The medium or receiver can be software installed on a device; it must have a receiver and a screen. The computer serves a good purpose, although other devices can receive words without displaying them.</p><p>A speech-to-text technology does not necessarily have to contain displaying screen: a sound interpreter may replace the screen. Thus, speech-to-text can be oral words - electronic recognition - word encoding - display, or recitation. Oral wordings are the human’s contribution to speech-to-text technology, although all communication (especially speech) may be generated from a computer. Inter-device communication is another advancement of speech-to-text technology. For example, combining one or more devices allow you to use speech-to-text assistance technology in different languages.</p><p>Communication is the paramount importance in speech-to-text technology. Still, some advantages include easy data conversion, documentation, workflow flexibility, and easy access to data. For example, documentation is incomplete if every human cannot access the file. All humans cannot read; improvising data into oral documents reduces the percentage of people who cannot access the file. Speech-to-text increases the channel for less privileged individuals. For instance, the deaf who cannot listen to a recorded file can read the file via speech-to-text technology.</p><p>Speech-to-text technology incorporates many advantages. Learning to use the technology is the first step in familiarizing and getting yourself equipped.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-stages-for-the-technology"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-stages-for-the-technology" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the stages for the technology?"></a>Part 2: What are the stages for the technology?</h2><p>STT gives so many stages and applications for a daily and smooth organization. Some include:</p><h3 id="1-Education"><a href="#1-Education" class="headerlink" title="1. Education"></a>1. Education</h3><p>Education and the love to study other languages increase with speech-to-text technology. The educative application is not limited to four corners of the room; it extends to all daily learning activities. Communication is educative if you learn new things via communication.</p><p>STT improves all processes associated with less privileged education. For example, everyone easily pours their mind into a computer screen page when they speak, especially in the language they understand using STT. Time and submission date are important factors in the educational system; STT improves time, submission, accuracy, and authentication.</p><h3 id="2-Video-Subtitles"><a href="#2-Video-Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="2. Video Subtitles"></a>2. Video Subtitles</h3><p>Videography and filmmaking carry a large percentage of today’s media. Data input and integration in the video-making process weigh a lot, and the concept of STT reduces the load on the data specialist. Instead of long hours of typing, oral communication is applicable. Processing time is a factor of productivity; STTs do not only affect the time of production but also maintain accuracy.</p><h3 id="3-Chatbots"><a href="#3-Chatbots" class="headerlink" title="3. Chatbots"></a>3. Chatbots</h3><p>Chatbots are available on websites. Users have different preferences: some can type while others like to communicate via speech.

If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p><p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p><p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p><p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p><p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p><p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p><p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p><p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p><p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p><p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p><p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p><p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p><p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Blender-tips-how-to-make-blender-render-transparent-background-1.JPG"                      alt="Making Material Transparent in Blender"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Background-Transparent-in-Blender"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Background-Transparent-in-Blender" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Make a Background Transparent in Blender"></a>Part 3 How to Make a Background Transparent in Blender</h2><p>Having experimented with object material transparency in Blender, you can try hands at taking your creativity to the next level by creating <strong>Blender render transparent backgrounds</strong> in the software.

If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p><p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p><p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p><p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p><p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p><p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p><p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p><p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p><p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p><p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p><p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p><p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p><p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Blender-tips-how-to-make-blender-render-transparent-background-1.JPG"                      alt="Making Material Transparent in Blender"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Background-Transparent-in-Blender-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-a-Background-Transparent-in-Blender-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Make a Background Transparent in Blender"></a>Part 3 How to Make a Background Transparent in Blender</h2><p>Having experimented with object material transparency in Blender, you can try hands at taking your creativity to the next level by creating <strong>Blender render transparent backgrounds</strong> in the software.

Whether you want to create a montage of your memories as an anniversary gift or create a montage of product photos for promotions, uses are multiple here. This prompts the need for users to learn <strong>how to make a montage</strong>, and that is what we will cover in this post.</p><p>These videos, with a series of shots and information edited together cohesively in sequence, are useful for showcasing storyline progress. Here, you will learn about use cases of the process, like a <strong>birthday video montage</strong>, more ideas, and the process of making them. Read on if any of that interests you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/everything-you-need-to-know-about-video-montages-ideas-techniques-and-software-1.jpg"                      alt="video editing process"                ></p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Gaming Montages</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Wedding Montages</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Birthday Montages</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How Can I Create Easily a Montage Video?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Classic-Montage-Ideas-in-Art-and-Film"><a href="#Part-1-Classic-Montage-Ideas-in-Art-and-Film" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Classic Montage Ideas in Art and Film"></a>Part 1. Classic Montage Ideas in Art and Film</h2><p>Video montages play a major role in films, art productions, and gaming, like the <strong>call of duty montage</strong>.</p><p>In terms of the first example, when you watch movies, you might notice this technique used in many movies, utilized more prominently since the 1920s when Sergei Eisenstein coined the term first. These scenes appear as stitched-together shots of the characters showing time passage, enjoying activities or memories.</p><p>Different techniques are common, like rhythmic, metric, intellectual, or tonal. For example, the 2000 movie “Requiem for a Dream” showcased an intellectual&#x2F;metric style of video montage to show the disorientating effect of the character under drug influence. A relatively recent example would be Benedict Cumberbatch’s 2016 movie “Doctor Strange”, where the montage shows the titular character’s interaction with the villain (no spoilers).</p><h3 id="3-Top-Montages-in-Film-for-All-Times"><a href="#3-Top-Montages-in-Film-for-All-Times" class="headerlink" title="3 Top Montages in Film for All Times"></a>3 Top Montages in Film for All Times</h3><p>If the above two examples did not fully express <strong>what is a montage video</strong>, seeing more examples should help. For this, here are three of the top montage examples available in Film History, each version representing a separate video montage style.</p><p><strong>1. Rocky (1976)</strong></p><p>One of the most notable montages is available in the 1976 action movie, the Sylvester Stallone-starrer “Rocky”. The type of video montage that is visible in this movie is rhythmic in nature, showcasing the training the character undergoes. This is edited with a musical background score, summarising some shots’ full training progression process.</p><p>To add an emotive tone to the video, music is added to the video clip that engages audiences to feel the character’s passion. A rhythmic style of video montage technique is used to cut the shorts as per the content. The lengths of each clip are not similar and differ as per the action going on in the scene.</p><p><strong>2. Mulan (1998)</strong></p><p>Video montages are also visible in animated movies, as seen in the 1998 version of Disney’s “Mulan”. The scene in question is where the song “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” plays while Mulan undergoes strict training for the military from the male lead. A sequence of shots showing her progress is shown.</p><p>Here, the video montage is shown with the background music that perfectly aligns with what is occurring in the video. The visuals and the audio in the background cohesively show the main character’s struggle, which creates an emotional response in the audience. Therefore, the style of video montage here falls under tonal or overtonal categories.</p><p>Watch this <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMX5zkYnGB0" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get an idea of how music and visuals can partner for tonal video montages.</p><p><strong>3. Creed (2015)</strong></p><p>Like in the Rocky movie, its 2015 sequel, “Creed”, also has a video montage. Here, the clips in the sequence are also used to depict the intense training progress. However, where it differs from the rhythmic formula is that the sequence highlights the emotional journey or determination of Adonis Creed to succeed.</p><p>Plus, this video montage is a homage to the original version; the tonal effect is further noticeable in the scene of Rocky’s health deterioration against Creed’s training. Thus, it juxtaposes the two scenes, creating an emotional impact on viewers to root for the main character.</p><p>Watch this <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NH1A6CLIrY" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to understand <strong>what is a montage video</strong> of the tonal type.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Creative-Montage-Ideas-for-Social-Media"><a href="#Part-2-Creative-Montage-Ideas-for-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Creative Montage Ideas for Social Media"></a>Part 2. Creative Montage Ideas for Social Media</h2><p>Of course, movies and TV shows are the only types of media where video montage techniques are useful. Many non-professionals use options like a <strong>fortnite montage editor</strong> to create and edit montage videos for other projects they can share across platforms. Some even create video montages to create videos for social media.</p><p>These include vlog-like videos that people record and then edit together into a montage which different techniques. Plus, some users create montages of different things that interest them, like gameplay. Then, they share those videos across social media for views, like on TikTok or YouTube.</p><h3 id="·-Gaming-Montages"><a href="#·-Gaming-Montages" class="headerlink" title="· Gaming Montages"></a>· Gaming Montages</h3><p>Different creators focus on developing <strong>gaming montage</strong>s to create projects for the games they operate. These can include videos showcasing the skills or gameplays of the creation, all explaining a specific theme in some cases.</p><p>There are different games that the users focus on for showcasing their gaming prowess in action. Common examples include Fortnite, Call of Duty, CSGO, or <strong>PUBG montage</strong> videos.</p><p>Watch this <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_D_MW14nos" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get an idea.</p><h3 id="·-Wedding-Montages"><a href="#·-Wedding-Montages" class="headerlink" title="· Wedding Montages"></a>· Wedding Montages</h3><p>Many users turn to edit video montages for specific occasions, adding clips of different moments instead of one long-running documentary. They incorporate stylish effects like slow motion and transitions, incorporate a moving background score, and more.</p><p>Many top influencers and celebrities have used this technique for their wedding videos on social media. Additionally, regular people also adopt the style.</p><p>Watch this <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drY9MKE3ghk" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as an example.</p><h3 id="·-Birthday-Montages"><a href="#·-Birthday-Montages" class="headerlink" title="· Birthday Montages"></a>· Birthday Montages</h3><p>Like wedding videos, users can try out the video montage technique to create videos for birthdays. These can include scenes of the main creator throughout their preparation phase for the party.

Classic Montage Ideas in Art and Film</p><p>Video montages play a major role in films, art productions, and gaming, like the <strong>call of duty montage</strong>.</p><p>In terms of the first example, when you watch movies, you might notice this technique used in many movies, utilized more prominently since the 1920s when Sergei Eisenstein coined the term first. These scenes appear as stitched-together shots of the characters showing time passage, enjoying activities or memories.</p><p>Different techniques are common, like rhythmic, metric, intellectual, or tonal. For example, the 2000 movie “Requiem for a Dream” showcased an intellectual&#x2F;metric style of video montage to show the disorientating effect of the character under drug influence. A relatively recent example would be Benedict Cumberbatch’s 2016 movie “Doctor Strange”, where the montage shows the titular character’s interaction with the villain (no spoilers).</p><h3 id="3-Top-Montages-in-Film-for-All-Times-1"><a href="#3-Top-Montages-in-Film-for-All-Times-1" class="headerlink" title="3 Top Montages in Film for All Times"></a>3 Top Montages in Film for All Times</h3><p>If the above two examples did not fully express <strong>what is a montage video</strong>, seeing more examples should help. For this, here are three of the top montage examples available in Film History, each version representing a separate video montage style.</p><p><strong>1. Rocky (1976)</strong></p><p>One of the most notable montages is available in the 1976 action movie, the Sylvester Stallone-starrer “Rocky”. The type of video montage that is visible in this movie is rhythmic in nature, showcasing the training the character undergoes. This is edited with a musical background score, summarising some shots’ full training progression process.</p><p>To add an emotive tone to the video, music is added to the video clip that engages audiences to feel the character’s passion. A rhythmic style of video montage technique is used to cut the shorts as per the content. The lengths of each clip are not similar and differ as per the action going on in the scene.</p><p><strong>2. Mulan (1998)</strong></p><p>Video montages are also visible in animated movies, as seen in the 1998 version of Disney’s “Mulan”. The scene in question is where the song “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” plays while Mulan undergoes strict training for the military from the male lead. A sequence of shots showing her progress is shown.</p><p>Here, the video montage is shown with the background music that perfectly aligns with what is occurring in the video. The visuals and the audio in the background cohesively show the main character’s struggle, which creates an emotional response in the audience. Therefore, the style of video montage here falls under tonal or overtonal categories.</p><p>Watch this <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMX5zkYnGB0" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get an idea of how music and visuals can partner for tonal video montages.</p><p><strong>3. Creed (2015)</strong></p><p>Like in the Rocky movie, its 2015 sequel, “Creed”, also has a video montage. Here, the clips in the sequence are also used to depict the intense training progress. However, where it differs from the rhythmic formula is that the sequence highlights the emotional journey or determination of Adonis Creed to succeed.</p><p>Plus, this video montage is a homage to the original version; the tonal effect is further noticeable in the scene of Rocky’s health deterioration against Creed’s training. Thus, it juxtaposes the two scenes, creating an emotional impact on viewers to root for the main character.</p><p>Watch this <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NH1A6CLIrY" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to understand <strong>what is a montage video</strong> of the tonal type.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Creative-Montage-Ideas-for-Social-Media-1"><a href="#Part-2-Creative-Montage-Ideas-for-Social-Media-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The slow-motion effect, also known as the slow-mo effect, is widespread in modern cinema.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-2.gif"                      alt="difference between normal speed and slow speed"                ></p><p>Now that we know what Fast and slow-motion videos are.

For example, you can speed up your videos to create a funny video or shorten its length.</p><p>The fast-motion effect has many applications, such as cooking tutorial videos. For example, the step-by-step process of a cooking tutorial can be too long to fit into a single video. Or it could also help you in cases where you want to keep the length of the video short.</p><p>The fast motion of the steps will allow the viewer to quickly grasp the whole process without watching the entire video.</p><h3 id="Slow-Motion-Videos"><a href="#Slow-Motion-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Slow Motion Videos"></a>Slow Motion Videos</h3><p>You can also slow down your videos to give the viewers a more detailed perspective of a scene. Or you can also create a slow-mo video that offers a general surreal vibe.</p><p>A famous example is in action films.

For example, to open the Unifrom Speed panel, do as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video clip.</li><li>In the <strong>pop-up</strong> column, scroll down till you see the <strong>Unifrom Speed</strong> option and click on it.</li><li>The speed controls will be shown in the import window.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-8.png"                      alt="wondershare filmora unifrom speed tab"                ></p><p>In the speed control panel, you can see the speed adjuster slider. A number will usually mark this at the end. This number tells you the current speed your video is calibrated in and how fast or slow the motion effects will be.</p><p><strong>1.00</strong> is always the average speed. <strong>0.5</strong> being half and <strong>2.00</strong> being double the average speed. To control the speed through the slider, you will need to do the following:</p><ul><li><strong>To increase the speed:</strong> Type in the number you want your rate to be. Or, drag the slider to the right as you wish.</li><li><strong>To decrease the speed:</strong> Type in a number less than the standard 1.00, or you can drag the slider to the left as you wish.</li></ul><p>The number of your speed can be an inconvenience if you have no prior experience. Instead, render the video and play it from the beginning with the changes that you made. It gives you a better idea of the speed of your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-9.png"                      alt="wondershare filmoa opening the speed adjustment panel"                ></p><h5 id="Step5-Detach-The-Audio"><a href="#Step5-Detach-The-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Detach The Audio"></a>Step5 Detach The Audio</h5><p>The corresponding audio also gets affected when you slow down or speed up a video.

For example, to open the Unifrom Speed panel, do as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video clip.</li><li>In the <strong>pop-up</strong> column, scroll down till you see the <strong>Unifrom Speed</strong> option and click on it.</li><li>The speed controls will be shown in the import window.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-8.png"                      alt="wondershare filmora unifrom speed tab"                ></p><p>In the speed control panel, you can see the speed adjuster slider. A number will usually mark this at the end. This number tells you the current speed your video is calibrated in and how fast or slow the motion effects will be.</p><p><strong>1.00</strong> is always the average speed. <strong>0.5</strong> being half and <strong>2.00</strong> being double the average speed. To control the speed through the slider, you will need to do the following:</p><ul><li><strong>To increase the speed:</strong> Type in the number you want your rate to be. Or, drag the slider to the right as you wish.</li><li><strong>To decrease the speed:</strong> Type in a number less than the standard 1.00, or you can drag the slider to the left as you wish.</li></ul><p>The number of your speed can be an inconvenience if you have no prior experience. Instead, render the video and play it from the beginning with the changes that you made. It gives you a better idea of the speed of your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-9.png"                      alt="wondershare filmoa opening the speed adjustment panel"                ></p><h5 id="Step5-Detach-The-Audio-1"><a href="#Step5-Detach-The-Audio-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Detach The Audio"></a>Step5 Detach The Audio</h5><p>The corresponding audio also gets affected when you slow down or speed up a video.

Whether you’re looking for an entry-level drone that won’t break the bank or a top-of-the-line model that will let you capture stunning 4K footage, we’ve got you covered. So read on to find the perfect drone for you!</p><h2 id="Buyers-Guide-The-Best-6-Drones-on-the-Market-for-Every-Budget"><a href="#Buyers-Guide-The-Best-6-Drones-on-the-Market-for-Every-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Buyers Guide: The Best 6 Drones on the Market for Every Budget"></a>Buyers Guide: The Best 6 Drones on the Market for Every Budget</h2><p><strong>#1. DJI Air 2S:</strong> Among the best options for most people.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-air-2s.jpg"                      alt="dji air 2s"                ></p><p>The DJI’s new Air 2S is our top pick. It finds the ideal compromise in terms of size, weight, picture quality, intelligent features, and price. The camera on the Air 2S isn’t as nice as the Mavic 2 Pro’s, which has a variable aperture for more flexible shooting in sunny conditions and includes neutral density filters to help make up for it.</p><p>1.3 pounds might not seem like much, but the Air 2S is a force to be reckoned with- it’s durable enough to fly in light winds and can stay up for 30 minutes! Plus, the new collision-avoidance system will keep you safe even when there are trees around, and the 1 inch 20 mp sensor captures amazing 5K video or still photos.</p><p><strong>#2. Skydio 2+ Drone:</strong> If you want your flights to be handled automatically.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/skydio-2-drone.jpg"                      alt="skydio 2 drone"                ></p><p>The Skydio 2+ has the best collision-avoidance system, far outperforming any other drone on the market. If you want a drone that can follow your mountain bike off-road or quickly maneuver through obstacles without your help, this is it. Its 27-minute flight time and 6-mile range make it restrictions for some people, but plenty for most. The 1&#x2F;2.3-inch sensor on this camera is good enough for 4K footage at 60 frames per second, but it’s not as great as the 1-inch sensor in the Air 2S and Evo Lite+. D-log support is also absent, so video professionals might want to keep that in mind.</p><p>However, if you can live without D-log and don’t mind the slower sensor, this drone is capable of flying in places where other drones can’t. For certain applications, a smaller sensor may be preferable to having a great one.</p><p><strong>#3. DJI Mini 3 Pro:</strong> The Best Ultralight Drone for Most People <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-mini-3-pro.jpg"                      alt="dji mini 3 pro"                ></p><p>The DJI Mavic Mini 3 Pro is the third version of the name, and it has been greatly improved from its original state. It features a 4K&#x2F;60p footage with 1&#x2F;1.3” sensor as well capture 12.1 megapixel RAW photographs. The Mini 3 Pro also has a 48-megapixel mode that improves image quality, but loses some camera functions. A faster F&#x2F;1.7 lens is now on the front of the drone, and it also incorporates three-direction obstacle avoidance and a gimbal that allows for vertical shooting–all while weighing in at less than 250 grams. This number is important because, in many areas, a drone under 250 grams does not need to be registered (however, you should always check your local laws).</p><p>I was ecstatic about the performance of the Mini 3 Pro. It can fly in an impressive 45 minutes when using its extended battery–which is a dramatic improvement from the 32 minutes I got with the standard battery. Not to mention, it’s delightful to fly because it maneuvers so effortlessly in even high winds. The only issue I have with it is that its price has risen since DJI released Mini 2; however, they still sell both models.</p><p><strong>#4. DJI Mini 2:</strong> Most Affordable Drone <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-mini-2.jpg"                      alt="dji mini 2"                ></p><p>The Mavic Air 2S has advanced collision-avoidance tech, but at a high cost. Even the new Mini 3 Pro sells for $750. If budget is more important to you than features, DJI’s Mini 2 would be your best bet. It flies compared to its larger siblings, though wind gusts that wouldn’t bother bigger drones like the Mavic 2 Pro will ground the Mini. The lack of collision-avoidance sensors makes it better suited for experienced pilots.</p><p>Even with those minor drawbacks, the Mini 2 is still a great beginner drone. It’s enjoyable to fly, captures 4K video footage, and can be stored in smaller spaces than many smartphones. And that last part is essential because the best drones are ones that you’ll actually bring with you instead of leaving at home. The Mini 2 only weighs 249 grams so it’s easy to transport, and you don’t even need to register it with the Federal Aviation Administration</p><p><strong>#5. DJI Mavic 3:</strong> The Most Luxurious Drone <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-mavic-3.jpg"                      alt="dji mavic 3"                ></p><p>The DJI Mavic 3 Pro is a cut above the rest. It’s the finest drone on the market right now. The new 20-megapixel Four Thirds sensor produces outstanding image and video quality, and 45 miles per hour mobility allows you to follow and track objects without missing a beat.</p><p>If you’re willing to spend the money, this drone is definitely worth it. It has a 45-minute flying time and can avoid obstacles in all directions. The Cine model also supports Pro Res video and comes with 1TB of storage space- perfect for filmmakers or anyone who wants to capture high-quality footage.</p><p><strong>#6. Autel Evo Lite+:</strong> Great for Long Flights <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/autel-evo-lite.jpg"                      alt="autel evo lite"                ></p><p>The Evo Lite+ is your best bet if you want to stay airborne as long as possible. Its massive battery provides a 40-minute flight duration, and the additional weight makes it more stable in the wind (though not by much). The Evo Lite+ features a fantastic camera with variable aperture controls, a 1-inch sensor, and night mode for better low-light photos.</p><p>The control does resemble an Xbox controller, which is nice, but it lacks the storage capacity for detachable joysticks that you get with DJI drones. It’s still perfectly functional, and Autel’s software will be familiar to anyone who has used a DJI drone.</p><h2 id="Some-Final-Suggestions"><a href="#Some-Final-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="Some Final Suggestions"></a>Some Final Suggestions</h2><p>Drones can be used for a variety of purposes, from shooting landscapes and cityscapes to capturing footage of sporting events or outdoor activities. They can also be used for wedding videos, real estate videos, and other types of commercial work. And if you’re just looking for some fun footage to add to your home movies, drones are the perfect way to do it.</p><p>Of course, not all drones are created equal. If you’re looking for a drone that can shoot high-quality video on a budget, there are a few things you need to keep in mind.</p><ul><li>First, make sure the drone has a high-resolution camera.</li><li>Second, make sure the drone has a long battery life so that you can get plenty of shots without having to recharge.</li><li>Third, make sure the drone is lightweight and easy to control so that you can get the perfect shot every time.</li></ul><p>So, what’s the best drone for you? It depends on your budget and your needs. If you want a high-quality camera that can shoot in low light, the DJI Mavic 3 Pro is a perfect choice. If you’re looking for a long-flight drone, the Autel Evo Lite+ is a great option. And if you’re just starting out, the DJI Mini 2 is an affordable and easy-to-use drone that anyone can fly.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Best-6-Online-MP4-Croppers"><a href="#Best-6-Online-MP4-Croppers" class="headerlink" title="Best 6 Online MP4 Croppers"></a>Best 6 Online MP4 Croppers</h2><p>A part of the editing process is cropping the video from the raw mp4 file. This article will show you the best 6 online mp4 croppers. The question is which will suit you best? You may be from different levels of expertise when it comes to video editing. Are you aware of your personal needs and standards when it comes to looking for the best online mp4 cropper?</p><p>You may one day face that you cannot choose between the countless options available online. Testing each of these would take a huge chunk of your time. The time that could be spent on other activities that you rather do. Also, the overwhelming feeling of not knowing where to start.</p><h2 id="Ezgif-Video-Crop"><a href="#Ezgif-Video-Crop" class="headerlink" title="Ezgif Video Crop"></a>Ezgif Video Crop</h2><p>Ezgif is an online video cropping tool that supports multiple file formats for your video. If you’re worried about the tool’s difficulty of using the tool then, I have good news for you. This is not filled with confusing icons and tabs. You can simply copy and paste the URL and begin the cropping process. In addition, you can add your file from your local computer’s storage. A smart choice for your video cropping needs!</p><p>Although, there is no perfect tool without its strengths and weaknesses. So, we will show you the reality side and how other users perceive its usefulness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/online-mp4-cropper-1.png"                      alt="online-mp4-cropper"                ></p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Capable of cropping various types of videos including MP4, WebM, AVI and many more. This means that it can also output different formats and encoding. This article may seem to focus on mp4 format but if in the future that you would need a different format then this may come in handy.</li><li>The power to set the cropping size and ratio more effectively. There are also presets available to help you transform it into video square, 4:3, 16:9, 3:2 and many more. Having a cropping area that you can easily adjust is such a helpful feature.</li><li>It shows the display configuration info for imported mp4 video files.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>The maximum file size is only 100 mb (megabyte). Which means that you have to consider if your mp4 video file would not exceed this limit. A disadvantage indeed especially for those who have a video recorder that saves it in high quality. There is also a fear that the user would be hassled by trimming longer videos into shorter clips just to meet this requirement.</li><li>The video preview is not the same as the final output. The quality in the preview may be shown as having a much lower quality.</li><li>Other video file formats may not play due to incompatibility. This may be a huge disadvantage especially if you’re looking for efficiency in getting stuff done.</li></ul><h2 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a video editing application that considers the user experience of its consumers.

It brands itself as having an easy interface that communicates with the user. It is indeed a great online video cropper for mp4 files. By checking the video editor, you could also see the additional features for your future editor needs.

This article may seem to focus on mp4 format but if in the future that you would need a different format then this may come in handy.</li><li>The power to set the cropping size and ratio more effectively. There are also presets available to help you transform it into video square, 4:3, 16:9, 3:2 and many more. Having a cropping area that you can easily adjust is such a helpful feature.</li><li>It shows the display configuration info for imported mp4 video files.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>The maximum file size is only 100 mb (megabyte). Which means that you have to consider if your mp4 video file would not exceed this limit. A disadvantage indeed especially for those who have a video recorder that saves it in high quality. There is also a fear that the user would be hassled by trimming longer videos into shorter clips just to meet this requirement.</li><li>The video preview is not the same as the final output. The quality in the preview may be shown as having a much lower quality.</li><li>Other video file formats may not play due to incompatibility. This may be a huge disadvantage especially if you’re looking for efficiency in getting stuff done.</li></ul><h2 id="Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a video editing application that considers the user experience of its consumers.

These features will give a better understanding of the tool and provide a guideline on how to utilize the best functions with ease:</p><h3 id="1-Interface"><a href="#1-Interface" class="headerlink" title="1. Interface"></a>1. Interface</h3><p>When understanding the interface of <strong>the LumaFusion app</strong> on iOS, many would think the application won’t provide extensive tools to work with. This video editor does not come with a bland user interface but provides some great functions and features on an interface that allows you to create professional-level videos.</p><p>With the option of adding titles, transitions, color grading, and effects, LumaFusion is a complete video editor that provides features that are not commonly observed in many desktop-based video editors. Regardless, it presents an efficient workspace that has managed all the functions properly in rows and different sections.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/lumafusion-video-editor-2.jpg"                      alt="lumafusion video editor interface"                ></p><h3 id="2-Video’s-Layers"><a href="#2-Video’s-Layers" class="headerlink" title="2.

With the option of including six layers of video in the timeline, a lot can be done with them for improvising different sequences and multiple effects. Its picture-in-picture presets, layered transitions, graphic equalizer, and the use of additional plugins allow you to create complete videos with proper control.</p><p>Talking about some renowned iOS video editors in the market, you will find <strong>LumaFusion</strong> a much better option. iMovie, the dedicated video editor for iOS devices, can only embed two layers of videos in the timeline. This clearly explains why LumaFusion is a much better option with its video layers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/lumafusion-video-editor-3.jpg"                      alt="video layers in lumafusion"                ></p><h3 id="3-Powerful-Keyframe"><a href="#3-Powerful-Keyframe" class="headerlink" title="3.

You can ecstatically create animating effects with the help of the keyframe sounds within the application. These effects, once created, can be saved and used on other videos within the platform. To improve your effects on the mobile video editor, you can use the powerful keyframe feature of LumaFusion to create the best results.</p><p>With a small price to pay for the video editor, you can gain access to a diversity of keyframes that can help you design the perfect effects for your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/lumafusion-video-editor-4.jpg"                      alt="lumafusion keyframe feature"                ></p><h3 id="4-Export-to-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#4-Export-to-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="4.

You can easily export your created video to Final Cut Pro as an FCPXML.zip file directly after paying a one-time price. Users who are having a rough time editing the file on LumaFusion can easily shift to Final Cut Pro.</p><p>This process has disadvantages, regardless of the extensive control and accessibility provided between the applications. If you seek to use Final Cut Pro after editing a video on the <strong>LumaFusion app</strong>, you will have to add all the assets on FCP when you shift the file onto the platform.</p><p>Also, you might have to include many effects such as LUTs, Chroma key, and other relevant features.

These features will give a better understanding of the tool and provide a guideline on how to utilize the best functions with ease:</p><h3 id="1-Interface-1"><a href="#1-Interface-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Interface"></a>1. Interface</h3><p>When understanding the interface of <strong>the LumaFusion app</strong> on iOS, many would think the application won’t provide extensive tools to work with. This video editor does not come with a bland user interface but provides some great functions and features on an interface that allows you to create professional-level videos.</p><p>With the option of adding titles, transitions, color grading, and effects, LumaFusion is a complete video editor that provides features that are not commonly observed in many desktop-based video editors. Regardless, it presents an efficient workspace that has managed all the functions properly in rows and different sections.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/lumafusion-video-editor-2.jpg"                      alt="lumafusion video editor interface"                ></p><h3 id="2-Video’s-Layers-1"><a href="#2-Video’s-Layers-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Video’s Layers"></a>2. Video’s Layers</h3><p>Creating proper movies on your iOS device is not difficult with LumaFusion. With the option of including six layers of video in the timeline, a lot can be done with them for improvising different sequences and multiple effects. Its picture-in-picture presets, layered transitions, graphic equalizer, and the use of additional plugins allow you to create complete videos with proper control.</p><p>Talking about some renowned iOS video editors in the market, you will find <strong>LumaFusion</strong> a much better option. iMovie, the dedicated video editor for iOS devices, can only embed two layers of videos in the timeline. This clearly explains why LumaFusion is a much better option with its video layers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/lumafusion-video-editor-3.jpg"                      alt="video layers in lumafusion"                ></p><h3 id="3-Powerful-Keyframe-1"><a href="#3-Powerful-Keyframe-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Powerful Keyframe"></a>3. Powerful Keyframe</h3><p>The keyframes function on LumaFusion is not challenging to work with on the video editor. You can ecstatically create animating effects with the help of the keyframe sounds within the application. These effects, once created, can be saved and used on other videos within the platform. To improve your effects on the mobile video editor, you can use the powerful keyframe feature of LumaFusion to create the best results.</p><p>With a small price to pay for the video editor, you can gain access to a diversity of keyframes that can help you design the perfect effects for your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/lumafusion-video-editor-4.jpg"                      alt="lumafusion keyframe feature"                ></p><h3 id="4-Export-to-Final-Cut-Pro-1"><a href="#4-Export-to-Final-Cut-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Export to Final Cut Pro"></a>4. Export to Final Cut Pro</h3><p>Another impressive and touching feature this video editor provides to its users is its integration with Final Cut Pro - a proficient desktop video editor offered on macOS. You can easily export your created video to Final Cut Pro as an FCPXML.zip file directly after paying a one-time price. Users who are having a rough time editing the file on LumaFusion can easily shift to Final Cut Pro.</p><p>This process has disadvantages, regardless of the extensive control and accessibility provided between the applications. If you seek to use Final Cut Pro after editing a video on the <strong>LumaFusion app</strong>, you will have to add all the assets on FCP when you shift the file onto the platform.</p><p>Also, you might have to include many effects such as LUTs, Chroma key, and other relevant features. With this effort, you can easily put your video from LumaFusion to Final Cut Pro.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-LumaFusion-Video-Editor-1"><a href="#Part-3-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-LumaFusion-Video-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Advantages and Disadvantages of LumaFusion Video Editor"></a>Part 3: Advantages and Disadvantages of LumaFusion Video Editor</h2><p>Suppose you are considering using the <strong>LumaFusion video editor</strong> on your iOS device. In that case, there are a few advantages and disadvantages you must look into to understand more about the tool and get to an absolute decision:</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>You can add third-party plugins to your video editor to enhance the video editing features. This allows you to put better effects, transitions, and enhancement elements in your video.</li><li>It can create smooth slow-motion videos with 120fps and 240fps results.</li><li>Multi-layer titles can be created within the platform and used in further actions.</li><li>The display of the edited video can be previewed across an external monitor.</li><li>It provides stability in video editing by using color tags within frame rates up to 18fps.</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>For large video files, you might face lagging issues and audio synchronization within videos.</li><li>To access the complete library of music and clips, you will have to subscribe to their additional plans.</li><li>The tool is already available at a price tag, which is associated with more subscription plans, making it a devalued option.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-What’s-New-in-LumaFusion-3-2-Version-1"><a href="#Part-4-What’s-New-in-LumaFusion-3-2-Version-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: What’s New in LumaFusion 3.2 Version"></a>Part 4: What’s New in LumaFusion 3.2 Version</h2><p>The latest iteration of the <strong>LumaFusion app</strong> brings new and exciting features to the market.

The data from the iCloud Drive can also be restored directly from the platform.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/lumafusion-video-editor-6.jpg"                      alt="access the icloud backups"                ></p><h3 id="3-Rename-Linked-Folders-1"><a href="#3-Rename-Linked-Folders-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

They are widely used on social media platforms and messaging apps, making it easy to share moments, reactions, and emotions with friends and family. But not all GIFs are created equal. Some GIFs can look choppy and low-quality, detracting from the viewing experience.</p><p>To improve the quality of your GIFs, you can convert your MP4 videos to 60 FPS (frames per second). This will give your GIFs a smooth, fluid motion that looks professional and visually appealing. In this article, we’ll go over the steps you need to follow to convert your MP4 videos to 60 FPS GIFs and create high-quality GIFs that are perfect for sharing online.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/convert-mp4-video-60-fps-gif.JPG"                      alt="convert mp4 video to 60 fps gif"                ></p><h2 id="Why-Convert-MP4-to-60-FPS-GIF"><a href="#Why-Convert-MP4-to-60-FPS-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Why Convert MP4 to 60-FPS GIF?"></a>Why Convert MP4 to 60-FPS GIF?</h2><p>GIFs are a great way to share short, eye-catching videos online, but not all are made the same. GIFs with low frame rates tend to look choppy, and the motion could be smoother, making the video look unprofessional and detracting from the overall viewing experience. On the other hand, GIFs with higher frame rates look smoother, and the motion is more fluid, making the video more visually appealing.</p><p>Converting your MP4 videos to GIFs has several benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Smoother Motion:</strong> By converting MP4s to GIFs, you increase the frame rate of your GIFs, giving them a smoother and more fluid motion.</li><li><strong>Increased Detail:</strong> Higher frame rates allow for more detail and clarity in fast-moving scenes, making the video more engaging and easier to watch.</li><li><strong>Reduced Ghosting:</strong> A higher frame rate reduces the “ghosting” effect in low-frame rate GIFs, making the video clearer and reducing distractions.</li><li><strong>High-Quality Videos:</strong> Converting MP4s to GIFs eliminates the ghosting effect and creates high-quality GIFs that are perfect for sharing online.</li><li><strong>Increased Engagement:</strong> High-quality GIFs will engage and entertain your audience, making them more likely to share and interact with your content.</li></ul><p>Converting MP4s to GIFs is a great way to improve the overall quality of your GIFs and create visually appealing videos that are perfect for sharing online.

Value 1 would give you 100 FPS; value 2 would already have half of 100 FPS, that is, 50 FPS; value 3 would give you 33.3 FPS GIF, etc. So there are 20 FPS GIFs, 33.3 FPS GIFs, 50 FPS GIFs, and 100 FPS GIFs.</p><p>In addition, many websites or programs (including Google Chrome) ignore value 1 (100 FPS GIFs) and default to a much slower animation speed when viewing GIF files. Therefore, 100 FPS GIFs are technically possible but are rarely used. Value 2 (50 FPS) is the most you can get.</p><p>If you want to create high-quality animations, consider using MP4s or alternative image formats better suited for high frame rates and detailed animations.</p><p>That being said, some websites may have a “60 FPS GIFs” category, but it’s important to understand that most of the content in these categories is not 60 FPS. Instead, it’s likely to be either an MP4 video or a GIF with a lower frame rate, like 50 FPS, labeled as “60 FPS” for marketing purposes.</p><h2 id="Is-There-Any-60-FPS-GIF-Maker"><a href="#Is-There-Any-60-FPS-GIF-Maker" class="headerlink" title="Is There Any 60 FPS GIF Maker?"></a>Is There Any 60 FPS GIF Maker?</h2><p>Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a 60 FPS GIF maker. As mentioned before, there is no 60 FPS GIF, so it is impossible to create a 60 FPS GIF using traditional methods. However, many excellent video-to-GIF converters in the market allow you to set the GIF frame rate.</p><p>These video-to-GIF converters allow you to convert MP4 videos to GIFs with a higher frame rate, which can give your GIFs a smoother and more fluid motion.

What is speed ramping?"></a>Part 1. What is speed ramping?</h2><p>You’ve probably seen speed ramping used in suspenseful moments of a basketball video before, like a ball bouncing on the rim or a long buzzer-beating shot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-1.gif"                      alt="cinematic shots of a basketball player"                ></p><p>With speed ramping, we can slow down our most exciting moments to show our audience. And then speed it up again to keep pace with the music or action. So it will give you a smooth transition effect.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-enhance-action-videos-with-the-speed-ramping-effect"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-enhance-action-videos-with-the-speed-ramping-effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

For our example footage, we want to ensure we have set our camera to a higher frame rate for filming this type of video since we’re going to use slow motion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-2.jpg"                      alt="shot footage from a higher angels"                ></p><p><strong>How to capture the best footage?</strong></p><p>You can shoot handheld with a camera or a mobile phone because it allows you to move around your talent and catch some movements and action while giving a shaky camera effect for added suspense. To make evenly balanced videos, you can use a gimbal stabilizer. Here are some tips to get better shots.</p><ul><li>Change camera angles. Try getting shots low to the ground as well as at higher angles. That will give you more options to cut between when you edit the video.</li><li>Get various shots. You can get shots of dribbling, shooting, and just running with the ball to work with.</li><li>Try shooting on a longer lens. It is because you may not be able to get close to the action.</li><li>Record footage in slow mode on your camera or phone. It will allow you to capture more frames: the more frames, the smoother the slow-motion effect.</li></ul><p>Best capturing will make your video more cinematic and visually pleasing after preparing the footage. Finally, we will dive into edit tutorials on speed ramping and glitch effects separately for better understanding.</p><h5 id="Step2-Edit-the-speed-of-footage-in-Filmora"><a href="#Step2-Edit-the-speed-of-footage-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Edit the speed of footage in Filmora"></a>Step2 Edit the speed of footage in Filmora</h5><p>There are two ways to achieve the speed ramping effect. One is to use the speed ramping feature to adjust the video speed—the other way to achieve a similar effect is by using the standard speed settings.</p><p><strong>Edit with speed ramping feature in Filmora</strong></p><p>The speed ramping feature is included in Filmora standard license. So let’s start by opening Filmora.</p><p>1. Import media</p><p>First, import a video from your media library in the Wondershare Filmora. And drag the clip down on the timeline to start editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-3.jpg"                      alt="library in wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>2. Apply the speed ramping feature</p><p>To apply the speed ramping feature, <strong>right-click</strong> on the clip on the timeline. And click speed in the menu and choose <strong>speed ramping</strong> to open the settings window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-4.jpg"                      alt="add speed ramping option"                ></p><p>You can choose different speed templates in the setting window. Or, on the left corner, click on the customize option to adjust the keyframes and create the speed you want for the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-5.jpg"                      alt="speed templates on wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>The lower keyframe is when the video is slowest, and the peak is when the video is fastest. The middle parts between the keyframes are when it speeds up or slows down to reach the specific speed you set on each keyframe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-6.gif"                      alt="adjusting key-frames wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>Grab the keyframes and move them up to increase the speed or down to slow down the rate. You can also add more keyframes by moving the playhead to the spot where you want to change speed and clicking the plus button.</p><p>After adjusting our keyframes, we can play it back to see if we like the result.</p><p><strong>Edit with standard speed settings in Filmora</strong></p><p>Since speed ramping can only be used for paid users, we also provide you with an alternative way to give an exact transition effect, like speed ramping. Check out the following steps to add it.</p><p>1. You can <strong>drag</strong> the video from your library to the timeline. While in the <strong>timeline</strong>, double-click to open the speed menu.

Try getting shots low to the ground as well as at higher angles. That will give you more options to cut between when you edit the video.</li><li>Get various shots. You can get shots of dribbling, shooting, and just running with the ball to work with.</li><li>Try shooting on a longer lens. It is because you may not be able to get close to the action.</li><li>Record footage in slow mode on your camera or phone. It will allow you to capture more frames: the more frames, the smoother the slow-motion effect.</li></ul><p>Best capturing will make your video more cinematic and visually pleasing after preparing the footage.

One is to use the speed ramping feature to adjust the video speed—the other way to achieve a similar effect is by using the standard speed settings.</p><p><strong>Edit with speed ramping feature in Filmora</strong></p><p>The speed ramping feature is included in Filmora standard license. So let’s start by opening Filmora.</p><p>1. Import media</p><p>First, import a video from your media library in the Wondershare Filmora. And drag the clip down on the timeline to start editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-3.jpg"                      alt="library in wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>2. Apply the speed ramping feature</p><p>To apply the speed ramping feature, <strong>right-click</strong> on the clip on the timeline. And click speed in the menu and choose <strong>speed ramping</strong> to open the settings window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-4.jpg"                      alt="add speed ramping option"                ></p><p>You can choose different speed templates in the setting window. Or, on the left corner, click on the customize option to adjust the keyframes and create the speed you want for the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-5.jpg"                      alt="speed templates on wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>The lower keyframe is when the video is slowest, and the peak is when the video is fastest. The middle parts between the keyframes are when it speeds up or slows down to reach the specific speed you set on each keyframe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-6.gif"                      alt="adjusting key-frames wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>Grab the keyframes and move them up to increase the speed or down to slow down the rate. You can also add more keyframes by moving the playhead to the spot where you want to change speed and clicking the plus button.</p><p>After adjusting our keyframes, we can play it back to see if we like the result.</p><p><strong>Edit with standard speed settings in Filmora</strong></p><p>Since speed ramping can only be used for paid users, we also provide you with an alternative way to give an exact transition effect, like speed ramping. Check out the following steps to add it.</p><p>1. You can <strong>drag</strong> the video from your library to the timeline. While in the <strong>timeline</strong>, double-click to open the speed menu. Then choose the starting speed you want your video to be with the speed slider.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-7.jpg"                      alt="uniform speed"                ></p><p>2.

Many options are available, so it can be hard to decide which is the best for you.</p><p>Some factors to consider when choosing a cloud storage service for videos include how easy it is to use, the number of storage options available, and the price.</p><p>Some popular <strong>best video cloud storage</strong> services for videos include Flicker, Wondershare Drive, and Adobe Creative Cloud. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it’s essential to consider what you need before making a decision.</p><p>Ultimately, the best cloud storage service for videos is one that meets your specific needs.

Additionally, if you want to share photos and videos with others, you’ll need to <strong>upload video to the cloud</strong> or use the Flickr app on a device.</p><p>Overall, Flickr is a great online photo and video storage service, but it may not be the best option for you if you’re looking for a lot of space or want to share photos and videos with others.</p><h3 id="Flicker-Pro-Storage-Policy"><a href="#Flicker-Pro-Storage-Policy" class="headerlink" title="Flicker Pro Storage Policy"></a>Flicker Pro Storage Policy</h3><p>Flicker Cloud Storage is a paid storage service that offers users unlimited storage space and a range of features to help them manage their photos and videos.</p><p>The paid policy of Flicker Cloud Storage allows users to store unlimited data for a monthly fee of $5.99.

Tips to use green screen on Zoom video"></a>Part 3. Tips to use green screen on Zoom video</h2><p>Here are some important tips to use green screen on Zoom video for a better outcome.</p><p>Buy Large Green Screen - Since you are going to invest in buying green screen, you should buy a large green screen instead of buying two. Firstly, when you have one large green screen, you can set it up without any wrinkles or overlaps.</p><p>Secondly, a large green screen means greater surface area, and even when you slightly change the angle of your camera, your background will still have green screen instead of the exterior wall showing up and ruining virtual background effect.</p><p>Buy Green Screen Stand - Along with green screen, you should buy a sizeable green screen stand. A regular green screen stand contains two vertical supports at both ends and one horizontal support where you hand the green screen.</p><p>You can buy it according to the size of green screen you have bought.

How to crop a video in Davinci Resolve"></a>Part 1. How to crop a video in Davinci Resolve</h2><p>First and foremost, let’s get to know Davinci Resolve! As mentioned above, it is a software, so let’s be well-aware that we have to download and install it on our computer systems. Of course, it takes a bit of time, but to be able to use an advanced software, it’s totally worth it. If we are to search for the information about Davinci Resolve, we come across the following description: “color grading and non-linear video editing application for macOS, Windows, and Linux”. So, no matter which system we have, we can count on this software, which is a real advantage!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-1.jpeg"                      alt="crop-video-davinci"                ></p><p>To touch upon the functions, Davinci Resolve includes modules for video editing, color correction, audio mixing and effects, and visual effects. The interface of it is quite advanced, but would be well and soon understandable for someone who has ever used a similar editing software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro.

There are many benefits to using LUTs. Also, there are drawbacks of LUTs that cannot be neglected. Let’s discuss both benefits and disadvantages:</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>LUTs are fast and efficient in their color grading schemas. So they can enhance upscale color resolutions in a calculated way.</li><li>With maximum consistency, LUTs apply color grading across the frames in the video. Hence, this provides a consistent look to the video in unique colors.</li><li>Using LUTs, you can carry experiments on your video through filter presets. The presets are available in different colors and styles, and you can adjust them.</li></ul><p><strong>Drawbacks</strong></p><ul><li>There is a lack of personalization in most LUT filter presets. Hence, you cannot customize the color and styles for desired looks.</li><li>Due to limited precision, LUTs can involve color inaccuracies in their process. This happens because LUTs follow discrete values rather than using continuous gradients.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Like other events, weddings are also important occasions.

There are many benefits to using LUTs. Also, there are drawbacks of LUTs that cannot be neglected. Let’s discuss both benefits and disadvantages:</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>LUTs are fast and efficient in their color grading schemas. So they can enhance upscale color resolutions in a calculated way.</li><li>With maximum consistency, LUTs apply color grading across the frames in the video. Hence, this provides a consistent look to the video in unique colors.</li><li>Using LUTs, you can carry experiments on your video through filter presets. The presets are available in different colors and styles, and you can adjust them.</li></ul><p><strong>Drawbacks</strong></p><ul><li>There is a lack of personalization in most LUT filter presets. Hence, you cannot customize the color and styles for desired looks.</li><li>Due to limited precision, LUTs can involve color inaccuracies in their process. This happens because LUTs follow discrete values rather than using continuous gradients.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Like other events, weddings are also important occasions.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Best-9-Amv-Makers-for-Computer"><a href="#Best-9-Amv-Makers-for-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Best 9 Amv Makers for Computer"></a>Best 9 Amv Makers for Computer</h2><p>Anime music videos, or AMVs, have become increasingly popular over the years. They allow fans to showcase their creativity and love for their favorite anime series through the use of music and video editing. However, creating a high-quality AMV requires the right software. In this article, we will introduce you to the best AMV maker software available on the market.</p><h2 id="Best-AMV-Maker-for-Computer"><a href="#Best-AMV-Maker-for-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Best AMV Maker for Computer"></a>Best AMV Maker for Computer</h2><p>If you would like to create the AMVs on your computer, the following are some of your best options;</p><p><strong>Filmora</strong></p><p>Best For: Vloggers, teachers and social media users</p><p>Supported OS: Windows 11&#x2F;10&#x2F;8&#x2F;7 and macOS <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/reverse-option-filmora-toolbar.jpg"                      alt="filmora video editor"                ></p><p>Speaking of the best AMV video maker, I would recommend Filmora as the first choice. It is easy to learn and use for beginner, and come with rich video editing features: split screen, key framing, motion tracking, speed ramping, instant mode, speech to text, audio ducking and more.</p><p>Meanwhile, it also helps teachers or business people to record tutorials, files or PowerPoint from their screen wit no limit. For vloggers and other advanced users, Filmora provides green screen, AI Protrait, colorful video effect templates, color match and so forth. You can directly share the video to YouTube, Vimeo and other social media platforms.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><strong>Adobe Premiere</strong></p><p>Best For: Animators, professional cartoonists, and marketers</p><p>Supported OS: Windows and Mac <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="adobe premiere pro"                ></p><p>Adobe Premiere is a video editing program that can be used to create and edit all types of video projects including AMVs. It has numerous features that can make it very easy to come up with the most professional video that you want to create. Because of these very many, but very useful features, using Adobe Premiere can be difficult at first. But once you gate a hang of it, it is one of the best ways to create any video including AMVs.</p><p>Adobe Premiere can be used on both Mac and Windows operating systems and it is compatible with most video and audio formats. But like most Adobe software it is not a free solution. You do get a 7-day free trial that you can use without limitation, but you will need to pay a subscription fee to continue using it.</p><p><strong>Apple iMovie</strong></p><p>Best For: Marketers, freelancers, YouTubers, Bloggers</p><p>Supported OS: Mac <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-interface.jpg"                      alt="apple imovie"                ></p><p>Apple iMovie is one of the best video editing programs for Mac and is therefore one of the best tools to choose if you will be creating your AMV on a Mac. It has all the basic video editing features that you need for a project of this magnitude including the ability to merge videos and apply filters.</p><p>This makes it the most ideal tool for creating AMVs since you typically need to break a file into various sections for your AMV. You can then add audio to the video and choose one of the effects and filters to add to it. Once the video is complete, you can then export it in 4K resolution or upload it to YouTube directly.</p><p><strong>Sony Vegas</strong></p><p>Best For: Animators, Marketers, Video Editors and Bloggers</p><p>Supported OS: Windows and Mac <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vegas-pro.jpg"                      alt="sony vegas"                ></p><p>If you are looking for a program that is designed with AMVs in mind then Sony Vegas might be a good choice. Its main purpose is to help users create stunning anime videos and it has all the necessary features to make that happen.</p><p>Sony Vegas comes with a universal editor that allows you to create your video using the multi-cam editing feature or crossfades. You can also add various effects to the video including various colors and other special effects. But as you can probably guess, Sony Vegas may be a bit complicated for the beginner user, although there are numerous tutorials to help you through this process.</p><p><strong>Final Cut Pro</strong></p><p>Best For: Marketers, Animators, YouTubers, Freelancers, and Professional video editors</p><p>Supported OS: Windows and Mac <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/final-cut-pro.jpg"                      alt="final cut pro"                ></p><p>Final Cut Pro is another professional and highly effective video editor that you can use to create AMVs. It has very many video editing capabilities, allowing you to edit your video in numerous ways including cropping, rotating, blending, and more. It also has over 100 different transitions and more than 149 different visual effects to create your video any way you want to.</p><p>But perhaps the best feature that Final Cut Pro has when it comes to creating and editing AMV videos is the ability to organize and crop videos easily. The “Compounding Clips” feature, in particular, will come in handy when combining footage, soundtracks, and effects into one perfect AMV.</p><p><strong>Lightworks</strong></p><p>Best For: YouTubers, Freelancers, Bloggers, and Marketers</p><p>Supported OS: Windows and Mac <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lightworks-video-editor.jpg"                      alt="lightworks video editor"                ></p><p>Lightworks is an easy-to-use solution that you can use to create stunning AMV videos. The drag and drop interface makes it the most ideal solution even for beginners and it offers a lot of options for designing and customizing the videos. One other major benefit of choosing Lightworks is that it does come with a free version that is not as limited as you would expect.</p><p>The timeline is easy to use, allowing you to create AMVs from scratch or merge clips to create the video. You can also use numerous effects on the video and even add music to the video.</p><p><strong>Windows Movie Maker</strong></p><p>Best For: Freelancers, bloggers, marketers, and YouTubers</p><p>Supported OS: Windows <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-movie-maker.png"                      alt="windows movie maker"                ></p><p>Windows Movie Maker is one of the most popular video editing tools on the Windows OS and it has all the necessary editing features that you will need when you want to create AMV videos. On this free video editing tool, you can cut, split and crop the video or even add audio files and subtitles as needed,</p><p>It can work with numerous video and image formats, offering a wide range of options when it comes to video editing. Some of the functions that you can expect to use include video trimming, which can easily be done by simply dragging the slider to the desired location. But you will find that Windows Movie Maker lacks some of the features that can make your AMVs truly stand out.</p><h2 id="Best-AMV-Maker-for-Mobile-Phones"><a href="#Best-AMV-Maker-for-Mobile-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Best AMV Maker for Mobile Phones"></a>Best AMV Maker for Mobile Phones</h2><p>If you want to make AMVs on your mobile device, the following are some of the best options;</p><p><strong>Filmora</strong></p><p>Best For: Professional Animators, Marketers, YouTubes, and Bloggers</p><p>Supported OS: Android and iOS <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmorago-video-editor-android.jpg"                      alt="filmorago"                ></p><p>Filmora is one of the best video editing apps that you can download. It somehow manages to offer tools and video editing features that can otherwise be found only on desktop tools. Some of the features that can you can expect when using Filmora include reverse play, transitions, cropping, rotating, adding voiceovers, audio mixing, color tuning, and even picture-in-picture.</p><p>Filmora further simplifies the editing process by providing you with premade templates and themes that you can use to customize your AMV in many ways. It will also let you add music to the video from a huge library of licensed audio tracks.</p><p><strong>KineMaster</strong></p><p>Best For: Professional Animators, Bloggers, Marketers, and YouTubers</p><p>Supported OS: iOS and Android <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kinemaster-trim-videos.jpg"                      alt="kinemaster"                ></p><p>KineMaster is a video editing app that is designed for professionals but is easy enough to use that it can be useful to you even if it is your first time using it.

More significantly, it applies to everyone, not just world-class athletes</p><h2 id="How-to-create-Video-Brand-Guidelines"><a href="#How-to-create-Video-Brand-Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="How to create Video Brand Guidelines?"></a>How to create Video Brand Guidelines?</h2><p>Now that we’ve gone over why you need video brand guidelines, let’s take a look at how you can create them.</p><h3 id="1-Define-your-brand-voice"><a href="#1-Define-your-brand-voice" class="headerlink" title="1. Define your brand voice"></a><strong>1. Define your brand voice</strong></h3><p>This is perhaps the most important step in creating your guidelines, as it will determine the tone and style of all your future videos. To do this, you need to think about what makes your brand unique, and how you want it to be perceived by others. Once you have a good understanding of your brand voice, you can start to put together the rest of your guidelines.</p><h3 id="2-Choose-a-video-style"><a href="#2-Choose-a-video-style" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose a video style"></a><strong>2. Choose a video style</strong></h3><p>Depending on the kind of videos you want to make, you’ll need to choose an appropriate style. This could be anything from animation to live action, so it’s important to pick something that will work well with your brand voice.</p><h3 id="3-Decide-on-a-look-and-feel"><a href="#3-Decide-on-a-look-and-feel" class="headerlink" title="3. Decide on a look and feel"></a><strong>3. Decide on a look and feel</strong></h3><p>Just like with your choice of style, the look and feel of your videos should be in line with your brand identity. This means taking into account things like colour palette, typography and overall aesthetic.</p><h3 id="4-Write-a-script"><a href="#4-Write-a-script" class="headerlink" title="4. Write a script"></a><strong>4. Write a script</strong></h3><p>Once you have all the above elements in place, you can start to write a script for your video. This will act as a blueprint for the rest of the production process, so it’s important to get it right. When writing your script, be sure to keep your brand voice in mind, and make sure that the finished product stays true to your guidelines.</p><h3 id="5-Find-the-right-talent"><a href="#5-Find-the-right-talent" class="headerlink" title="5. Find the right talent"></a><strong>5. Find the right talent</strong></h3><p>To bring your script to life, you’ll need to find the right talent. This means finding voiceover artists, actors or presenters who fit with your brand identity and can help to sell your message.</p><h3 id="6-Record-and-edit-your-video"><a href="#6-Record-and-edit-your-video" class="headerlink" title="6. Record and edit your video"></a><strong>6. Record and edit your video</strong></h3><p>With all the pieces in place, you’re finally ready to record and edit your video.

Remember to use all the channels at your disposal, from social media to email marketing, to make sure that as many people as possible see your brand-new video.</p><h2 id="Brand-Guidelines-Consistency"><a href="#Brand-Guidelines-Consistency" class="headerlink" title="Brand Guidelines Consistency"></a>Brand Guidelines Consistency</h2><p>It’s important to be consistent with your brand. One of the biggest mistakes a company can make is trying to brand itself as something it isn’t. If you’re perceived as one thing and then suddenly change, it may do more harm than good for your business or organization.</p><p>The most well-known example of a company with a consistent brand is Coca Cola. It is one of the company brands with consistent brand image and a very strong reputation. This can be attributed to the company’s efforts in marketing and advertising to create a distinct brand image. The Coca Cola Company has spent millions of dollars on advertising campaigns that focus on creating a positive image for the product and reinforcing its original taste.</p><p>You need to have consistency in all aspects of your brand: logo, voice and tone (including social media), visuals (such as color scheme), and more. Your audience will immediately identify any inconsistencies between these elements - so make sure they match up well!</p><h2 id="Wrap-up"><a href="#Wrap-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrap-up"></a>Wrap-up</h2><p>Creating video brand guidelines may seem like a lot of work, but it’s worth it in the long run.

Many Professional Photographers Use It to Make Creative Video Effects. This Guide Will Show You How to Use Green Screen to Videos in After Effects</h2><p>You’ll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We’ll demonstrate how to do easily for you.</p><p>Let’s start off!</p><h2 id="1-Importing-your-footage"><a href="#1-Importing-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="1. Importing your footage"></a>1. Importing your footage</h2><p>After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the “Image Utilities” heading.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-green-screen-video-footage-ae.jpg"                      alt="import green screen video footage ae"                ></p><h2 id="2-Remove-the-green-color"><a href="#2-Remove-the-green-color" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove the green color"></a>2. Remove the green color</h2><p>After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the “Animation Presets” window, searching for the “Keylight” preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the “Effects Controls” window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen’s background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/remove-green-color-from-video-in-ae.jpg"                      alt="remove green color from video in ae"                ></p><h2 id="3-Clean-up-the-shot"><a href="#3-Clean-up-the-shot" class="headerlink" title="3. Clean up the shot"></a>3. Clean up the shot</h2><p>You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.</p><p>Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg"                      alt="clean up green screen shot ae"                ></p><p>You can go to the “Screen Matte” area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you’ve applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"                      alt="Free Download"                > For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Steps-to-Make-a-Neon-Dance-Effect-With-Filmora"><a href="#Steps-to-Make-a-Neon-Dance-Effect-With-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Make a Neon Dance Effect With Filmora"></a>Steps to Make a Neon Dance Effect With Filmora</h2><p>Neon colors in videos are constantly attracting and compelling the scenes.

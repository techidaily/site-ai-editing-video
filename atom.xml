In After Effects, this tool adds an invisible layer that is used to mask or reveal parts of a layer, including video, graphics, text, shapes, and images. This feature is in the arsenal of any visual effects artist or motion graphic designer.</p><p>For After Effects editors, <strong>Track Mattes</strong> can be an incredibly helpful tool for managing multiple layers and creating complex animations.</p><p>In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about <strong>Track Mattes</strong>. We’ll cover topics like the difference between a mask and Track Matte, finding this tool in After Effects, and its four options: Alpha Matter, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte.</p><ol><li><a href="#part4-1">Alpha Matte</a></li><li><a href="#part4-2">Alpha Inverted Matte</a></li><li><a href="#part4-3">Luma Matte</a></li><li><a href="#part4-4">Luma Inverted Matte</a></li><li><a href="#part4-5">Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel</a></li></ol><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-Track-Mattes-In-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-Track-Mattes-In-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Are Track Mattes In After Effects?"></a>Part 1. What Are Track Mattes In After Effects?</h2><p>A Track Matte is an element used in video editing to control the opacity of a layer. Essentially, it lets you create a “hole” in a layer so that underlying layers can show through. This tool can be used with video and audio layers, which is essential for creating complex composites in After Effects.</p><p>You can use Track Mattes to generate shapes, reveal part of a layer, or keying outs. Interestingly, it remains independent of all layers in your projects, which means you can get visual effects and animations more efficiently than with the masks tool.</p><p>Moreover, Track Mattes uses Alpha or Luma channels as a layer mask to determine what parts of the layer to reveal. For instance, you can make a top layer that provides an Alpha or Luminous effect and a bottom layer consisting of the image that will be revealed or shown.</p><p>Thus, if you want to use an image to hide your video until you want to unveil it or add a picture in your text, Track Mattes will help you to shape the appearance of a layer above it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Between-A-Mask-And-A-Track-Matte"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Between-A-Mask-And-A-Track-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte"></a>Part 2. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte</h2><p>In Adobe After Effects, there are two types of masking tools: Masks and Track Mattes. Both are used to hide or reveal a portion of a layer.</p><p>Here’re some key differences between a Mask and a Track Matte:</p><ol><li>A mask is dependent on a specific layer, while the Track Matter is independent of any layer.</li><li>A mask is applied directly to a layer having an image or a video and transforms with the layers.

All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects"></a>Part 4. All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects</h2><p>After Effects provides four types of Track Matte options: Alpha Matte, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte, each has its own specific use case. But first, you need to understand what Alpha and Luma are:</p><p><strong>Alpha:</strong> This Track Matte type uses the layer’s Alpha channel to determine the layer’s opacity.</p><p><strong>Luma:</strong> This Track Matte type uses the top layer’s brightness to mask the bottom layer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-four-track-matte-options-in-after-effects.png"                      alt="the four track matte options in after effects"                ></p><p>Let’s find out the functions of each option one by one:</p><h3 id="Alpha-Matte"><a href="#Alpha-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Alpha Matte"></a>Alpha Matte</h3><p>Alpha Matte is an important option under the Track Matte menu, as it allows you to create a mask based on the transparency of the layer you are using it on. Like the mask, it will use any pixel above 0% opacity and can be useful for various purposes, such as creating a vignette or isolating a certain area of the frame.</p><h3 id="Alpha-Inverted-Matte"><a href="#Alpha-Inverted-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Alpha Inverted Matte"></a>Alpha Inverted Matte</h3><p>The Alpha Inverted Matte option is quite the opposite of the Alpha Matte, and around the Alpha channel, it uses negative space from the above layer and will therefore use pixels with 0% opacity as it had 100% opacity.</p><h3 id="Luma-Matte"><a href="#Luma-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Luma Matte"></a>Luma Matte</h3><p>Instead of using the Alpha channel, Luma Mattes uses the brightness level or Luma channel of the upper layer to create a mask for the bottom layer.</p><h3 id="Luma-Inverted-Matte"><a href="#Luma-Inverted-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Luma Inverted Matte"></a>Luma Inverted Matte</h3><p>Opposite of the Luma Matte, the Luma Inverted Matte uses dark or low luminance areas of the upper layer to create a mask for the lower layer.</p><h3 id="Differences-Between-Alpha-Channel-and-Luma-Channel"><a href="#Differences-Between-Alpha-Channel-and-Luma-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel"></a>Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel</h3><p>When altering the opacity of a layer, it may look like the brightness settings are changed. This might confuse some users, as both Alpha and Luma channels carry the same information. However, they differ in how they are used.</p><p>Alpha channel is a type of Track Matte that stores transparency information. This information determines how opaque or transparent a layer will be when superimposed over another layer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/alpha-channel-in-track-matte.png"                      alt="alpha channel in track matte"                ></p><p>On the other hand, a Luma channel is a video track that stores brightness information. This information is used to determine how bright or dark an image will be and is further divided into three channels, i.e., Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). Their value ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 represents the darkest value while 255 represents the brightest value.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/luma-channel-in-track-matte.png"                      alt="luma channel in track matte"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Video – How to use Track Mattes in Adobe After Effects - Tutorial</strong></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve discussed what Track Matte is in After Effects and how it differs from the mask tool.

Typically, filmmakers use it to remove green screens and make color corrections to add warmth to the subjects’ skin tones.</p><p>It involves identifying a color or brightness value that you will make transparent in the photo. In addition, you can use two types of keys during the keying process.</p><h3 id="Chroma-Keys"><a href="#Chroma-Keys" class="headerlink" title="Chroma Keys"></a>Chroma Keys</h3><p>These allow you to select a specific color in your image and make everything that features the color transparent. Typically, chrome keys are best for images and videos featuring lots of green or blue backgrounds.</p><h3 id="Luma-Keys"><a href="#Luma-Keys" class="headerlink" title="Luma Keys"></a>Luma Keys</h3><p>Alternatively, you can use luma keys to determine which backgrounds will be transparent according to the brightness level. In addition, you can use them to designate the backgrounds you want opaque in your final image.</p><p>So, why do filmmakers prefer using a green screen? First, green is not a natural color in human skin tones. As such, it allows you more creative freedom with your shots. In addition, most digital cameras feature more green photosites allowing you to capture more details in your shots and making it the default choice for filmmakers.</p><p>However, you can also use a blue screen for your shots if green is your subject’s main color scheme. This is because blue is also rare among human subjects and allows you greater flexibility than any other background alternative.</p><p>Using a green screen key is an important skill to learn as a filmmaker. This is because it allows you more creative freedom resulting in more iconic images and photos. Although most video editing software allows you to apply the effect easily, it still requires finesse.</p><p>For example, using after effects green screen keying incorrectly can result in spill issues. This is when the green light from your screen bounces back to your subject. As such, you lose some subject detail, and the image appears messy.</p><p>Furthermore, not all video editing software includes the green screen key tool. Therefore, always check your software details before purchasing a copy.

Select the Video Tab and check the <strong>Chroma Key</strong> box to enable the effect. Once done, you can use the following tools to edit your footage:</p><ul><li><strong>Alpha Channel</strong></li></ul><p>The tool allows you to edit the footage’s borders, transparency, and shadows by displaying your image in black and white. The areas you have successfully keyed out will be in black and the rest in white or grey, depending on the severity.</p><ul><li><strong>Offset</strong></li></ul><p>The offset tool allows you to change the visibility of your background.</p><ul><li><strong>Edge Feathering.</strong></li></ul><p>You use this tool to soften your subject’s edges during green screen keying.</p><ul><li><strong>Edge Thickness.</strong></li></ul><p>The edge thickness tool helps you increase the sharpness of your subject’s edges.

In addition, you can subscribe to individual and business plans depending on your requirements. However, any creations using the Filmora Individual plan require you to mention the software in their description.</p><h2 id="Part4-FAQs"><a href="#Part4-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part4: FAQs"></a>Part4: FAQs</h2><h3 id="1-Is-there-a-difference-between-chroma-keying-and-green-screening"><a href="#1-Is-there-a-difference-between-chroma-keying-and-green-screening" class="headerlink" title="1. Is there a difference between chroma keying and green screening?"></a>1. Is there a difference between chroma keying and green screening?</h3><p>No. There is no difference between chroma keying and green screening. Both processes involve you replacing a specific color in your image and replacing it with a new background. In addition, some filmmakers use the terms synonymously because green is the best color to use when chroma keying. However, you can also use other colors for your chroma keying, with blue being the next best alternative.</p><h3 id="2-Can-you-create-a-green-screen-video-without-using-a-green-screen-background"><a href="#2-Can-you-create-a-green-screen-video-without-using-a-green-screen-background" class="headerlink" title="2.

It is possible to create a green screen video without a green background. Several apps, including Zoom and Tik Tok, have in-built digital green screens, which you can use to customize your creations. However, you need to have a capable device to access the function.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p></article[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)For macOS 10.14 or later<p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-how-to-elevate-landscape-imaging-with-your-iphone-device/"><u>[New] How to Elevate Landscape Imaging with Your iPhone Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-10-expert-suggestions-to-make-your-yt-shorts-stand-out/"><u>[New] In 2024, 10 Expert Suggestions to Make Your YT Shorts Stand Out</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-engaging-audiences-with-instagram-stories-surveys/"><u>[New] In 2024, Engaging Audiences with Instagram Stories Surveys</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/9-solutions-to-fix-process-system-isnt-responding-error-on-motorola-moto-g73-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>9 Solutions to Fix Process System Isnt Responding Error on Motorola Moto G73 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/create-the-stranger-things-upside-down-effect-video-for-2024/"><u>Create the Stranger Things Upside Down Effect Video for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/expert-insights-ranking-the-best-21-hdmi-monitor-models/"><u>Expert Insights Ranking the Best 2.1 HDMI Monitor Models</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/how-to-to-mimic-professional-filming-gears-for-2024/"><u>How to to Mimic Professional Filming Gears for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-sequence-in-video/"><u>In 2024, How to Create A Freeze Frame Sequence in Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-iphone-xs-max-official-method-to-unlock-your-iphone-xs-max-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Unlock iPhone XS Max Official Method to Unlock Your iPhone XS Max</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/in-2024-learn-how-to-create-a-kinetic-typography-text-effect-in-filmora-one-of-the-best-video-editors-for-all-skill-levels-check-out-this-simple-step-by-ste/"><u>In 2024, Learn How to Create a Kinetic Typography Text Effect in Filmora, One of the Best Video Editors for All Skill Levels.

Too high of a frame rate makes the video seem unnatural. On the other hand, too low can make some videos choppy. You can fix that by changing the frame rate using a video editor. And we are here to help you learn how to do that. Here’s <strong>how to change the frame rate in Premiere Pro.</strong></p><p>The frame rate sometimes makes or breaks the video. So it is important to get this setting right. Suppose you made a mistake and recorded your video in the wrong setting. You can follow this guide to solve your problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-premiere.JPG"                      alt="check frame rate in premiere pro"                ></p><h2 id="How-To-Check-Video-Frame-Rate-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#How-To-Check-Video-Frame-Rate-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How To Check Video Frame Rate in Premiere Pro"></a>How To Check Video Frame Rate in Premiere Pro</h2><p>Before we teach you how to change a video’s frame rate in Premiere Pro, let’s first make sure you know how to check. Maybe you don’t need to modify the video because it is already in the correct setting.</p><p>So how do you do that in Premiere Pro?</p><ol><li>Import the video to Adobe Premiere Pro.</li><li>Check the “Media” window. Next to the video file name is its frame rate. It is written in the format x.00 fps. FPS stands for “frames per second,” which is used interchangeably with the term frame rate.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-frame-rate-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="check video frame rate in premiere pro"                ></p><h2 id="Reasons-for-Changing-Frame-Rate"><a href="#Reasons-for-Changing-Frame-Rate" class="headerlink" title="Reasons for Changing Frame Rate"></a>Reasons for Changing Frame Rate</h2><p>Suppose you have an action-packed video. It would not look great at 30 fps - it will look too choppy. That will give your audience a rotten viewing experience. By increasing the frames, you can make the motion more fluid and smoother.</p><p>Increasing the frames per second also results in better slow-motion videos. A 30 fps one would not look good with this effect because it does not show smooth motion. Thus, we recommend making the video at least 60 fps.</p><p>However, a higher frame rate does not always mean better videos. It can result in what they call the “soap opera effect.” It means the video shows too many details. That makes the videos seem “unnatural” or less cinematic.</p><p>High frame rates make videos look more realistic since there is less stuttering and motion blur between frames. That’s great. But for older audiences - the ones used to watching videos at 24 fps, it can be off-putting. So it’s also important to consider your target audience when deciding the right frame rate for your video.</p><p>With these reasons in mind, you may want to change your video’s frame rate.</p><h2 id="How-To-Change-FPS-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#How-To-Change-FPS-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How To Change FPS in Premiere Pro"></a>How To Change FPS in Premiere Pro</h2><p>Let’s dilly-dally no more.

The best thing is that it’s super easy.</p><p>Follow these steps to change your video to 120 fps:</p><ol><li>Import your 120 fps video to Adobe Premiere Pro.</li><li>Select your footage.

However, it is a simple concept for video editors where the encoding settings determine the frequency at which the whole picture is transmitted.</p><p>The <strong>Keyframe Interval</strong> is responsible for how often a keyframe is generated within the video. A keyframe, also known as an i-frame, is a single frame that contains all of the necessary information for displaying a video. If the Keyframe Interval is set too high, it could lead to visible compression without compromising the quality of a video.</p><p><strong>Keyframe Interval</strong> is essential in video streaming and recording, but it can be confusing. In this guide, we’ll help you understand this concept to enable you to create better animations.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Keyframe-Interval"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Keyframe-Interval" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Keyframe Interval"></a>Part 1. What Is Keyframe Interval</h2><p>Keyframe Intervals, also known as “Keyframe Frequency” in Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder (FMLE) and vMix or “GOP size” by some encoders, is the frequency at which keyframes are generated in an animated sequence. This is an important parameter to consider when creating animations, as it can impact the animation’s file size, quality, and smoothness.</p><p>Keyframe Intervals are the distance in time between two keyframes. For example, if an animation is set to every 2 seconds interval and the frame rate is 30 per second, it means that every 60 frames, a keyframe is created.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/keyframe-interval-in-a-video.png"                      alt="keyframe interval in a video"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Keyframe-Interval-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Keyframe-Interval-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Does Keyframe Interval Work?"></a>Part 2. How Does Keyframe Interval Work?</h2><p>Keyframes are important in video and animation because they mark specific points in time that can be used to create a smooth and consistent transition between different states or images. The Keyframe Interval is the amount of time that passes between two keyframes.</p><p>In order to create a smooth and consistent transition, the Keyframe Interval must be carefully calculated. In a 60-frame-per-second video, a keyframe is recorded every 5 or 300 frames. Delta frames are “difference” frames that provide an incremental change from the previous frame.</p><p>Keyframes are different from delta frames in that a higher keyframe value results in a clearer video with fewer transmission artifacts and vice versa.</p><p>The Keyframe Interval can be adjusted to create a faster or slower transition between two keyframes. A shorter Keyframe Interval will create a faster transition, while a longer one will create a slower transition.</p><p>For example, if you want your transition to look smoother, use a longer interval, like two seconds. Conversely, a zoom effect over a 0.2-second interval will be quicker.</p><h2 id="Part-3-A-concept-closely-connected-to-Keyframe-Interval-Bitrates"><a href="#Part-3-A-concept-closely-connected-to-Keyframe-Interval-Bitrates" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. A concept closely connected to Keyframe Interval - Bitrates"></a>Part 3. A concept closely connected to Keyframe Interval - Bitrates</h2><p>The relationship between keyframes and bitrates is important to understand when creating video content. Keyframes are the frames in a video that are used to define the start and end points of an encoding process. The bitrate measures how much information is being transferred in a given time from one place to another.</p><p>When encoding video, keyframes are used to establish a consistent quality throughout the video. The bitrate is then used to determine how much information can be transferred without affecting the quality of the video. Thus, the higher the video’s bitrate, the better the quality.</p><p>Your mileage may vary regarding this explanation, as different encoders manage bitrates and keyframes in different ways.</p><p>For example, if you’re using an encoder like Wirecast, you might notice that broadcasting in a still background with someone talking results in a higher quality video as compared to a moving background. This can be reproduced using the same average bitrate and Keyframe Interval between them.</p><p>This happens because the delta frames have to share a lot more information to share in each frame in the video with a moving background. When you have an encoder like Wirecast, it’s working to keep your stream at an average bitrate. This can result in reduced quality if there is a lot of extra information in the <a class="link"   href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/delta-frame#:~:text=In%20interframe%20video%20coding%2C%20a,%2Dframes%20or%20B%2Dframes." >delta frames. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-4-What-You-Need-To-Know-To-Set-A-Right-Keyframe-Interval"><a href="#Part-4-What-You-Need-To-Know-To-Set-A-Right-Keyframe-Interval" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. What You Need To Know To Set A Right Keyframe Interval"></a>Part 4. What You Need To Know To Set A Right Keyframe Interval</h2><p>After understanding the important concepts in video editing, let’s see how to set the keyframe level in our videos appropriately.</p><p>Most streaming services will automatically set it for you based on your stream’s frame rate and bitrate. However, if you want to set the keyframe gap manually, there are a few things you need to keep in mind.</p><ul><li>Set the frame interval at 2 seconds. Do not increase it from 4 seconds.</li><li>Disable the “auto” keyframe feature.</li><li>To allow for b-frames, use an encoding profile higher than baseline and use IDR-based keyframes.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-5-How-To-Change-The-Keyframe-Interval-On-OBS-Studio"><a href="#Part-5-How-To-Change-The-Keyframe-Interval-On-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. How To Change The Keyframe Interval On OBS Studio"></a>Part 5. How To Change The Keyframe Interval On OBS Studio</h2><p>Above is the basic knowledge of the keyframe interval. Then, how to apply it to your real video-editing work? In this part, we will choose OBS to show you the application process.</p><p>OBS Studio is a powerful yet free and open-source screen recorder and live streaming tool for Windows, macOS, and Linux. One of the most useful features of OBS Studio is its ability to change the keyframe interval on the fly without having to restart your recording or stream.</p><p>The process for changing the it in OBS Studio has been made more efficient since the classic version. However, some users may have trouble locating the new setting.</p><p>Here’s how to change the it on OBS Studio:</p><p>Step1 Launch the <strong>OBS Studio</strong> on your PC or laptop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/launching-the-obs-studio.png"                      alt="launching the obs studio"                ></p><p>Step2 From the bottom right of the screen, open the <strong>“Settings”</strong> menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/obs-studio-settings-menu.png"                      alt="obs studio settings menu"                ></p><p>Step3 On the Settings Window, click <strong>“Output”</strong> and configure the output mode to <strong>“Advanced.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/setting-the-output-mode-to-advance-in-obs-studio.png"                      alt="setting the output mode to advance in obs studio"                ></p><p>Step4 Finally, edit the <strong>Keyframe Interval,</strong> set it to <strong>2</strong> seconds, and click <strong>“OK”</strong> to save your changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/changing-the-keyframe-interval-value-on-obs-studio.png"                      alt="changing the keyframe interval value on obs studio"                ></p><h2 id="Part-6-Will-Keyframe-Interval-Affect-Your-Video’s-Quality"><a href="#Part-6-Will-Keyframe-Interval-Affect-Your-Video’s-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Part 6. Will Keyframe Interval Affect Your Video’s Quality?"></a>Part 6. Will Keyframe Interval Affect Your Video’s Quality?</h2><p>When you try to set the keyframe gap by yourself, you may feel confused about the difference a higher or lower interval make to your video. Then, wil-l or how it affects your video’s performance?</p><p>In a stream, it determines the balance between smoothness and picture quality. A keyframe is a point that determines how often the entire frame is sent, as opposed to just the differences from the previous frame.</p><p>Therefore, if you set the Keyframe Interval higher, your video will be more stable with fewer artifacts but requires more bandwidth and processing power. Conversely, a lower Keyframe Interval value causes more artifacts but is less resource intensive.</p><p>A lower Keyframe Interval value will result in lower video quality, while a higher keyframe value will result in higher video quality. However, the optimal Keyframe Interval value can vary depending on the specific case.</p><p>For instance, you don’t need a higher Keyframe Interval for streaming a live video, but you have to use a higher Key Interval value for recording.</p><p>Video- What is the Maximum Bitrate &amp; Keyframe Interval for OBS</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>In this article, we’ve explored Keyframe Interval, how it works, and the relationship between keyframes and bitrates.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-To-Add-Fade-In-Windows-Video-Editor"><a href="#How-To-Add-Fade-In-Windows-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="How To Add Fade In Windows Video Editor"></a>How To Add Fade In Windows Video Editor</h2><p>A recent development in the media business is the fading into and out of videos, which significantly improves and cools down a scene. It causes the movie to twist and gives it a photorealistic appearance, giving the sense of depth. Too much or too little fading might ruin the whole impact of the video that has been generated, which is why we’re providing instructions on how to apply fade in Windows video editors.</p><p>People often search for How to Add Fade in after effects but in such tools, backgrounds are used to achieve fading, so what should you do if you want your movie on your Windows 10 desktop to fade to black, white, or another color? We suggest the solution in this article that would be of assistance. It is suggested that you apply the video fades using a backdrop clip which is either black or white. Video fades come in two varieties: fade in and fade out. A video or picture may gradually appear from a black, white, or colored backdrop using a technique called a “fade-in.” On the other hand, a video or picture may gradually blend into a white, black, or multicolored backdrop using the fade-out technique.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Add-Fade-in-Windows-Video-Editor"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Add-Fade-in-Windows-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Add Fade in Windows Video Editor"></a>Part 1: How to Add Fade in Windows Video Editor</h2><p>To begin with, you’ll need top-notch editing software for your movies. We advise you to try Windows Video Editor if you use Windows. It is slick, simple, and enjoyable to use. The Microsoft Store’s most downloaded video editing app is also this one. To test how it works, you may install it for free. The Windows video editor is a strong tool that makes it simple for users to utilize the fundamentals of video editing. It has the ability to move, concatenate, cut, and add the Fading effects to videos. However, it lacks the transitions needed to insert them into videos or in between them.</p><p><strong>Steps to Add Fade in Windows Video Editor</strong></p><p>Step1Open Windows Video Editor and choose the video clip you wish to apply a fade to.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/choose-video-windows-video-editor.jpg"                      alt="choose video windows video editor"                ></p><p>Step2To display further effects, click the down arrow in the corner of the effects tray after selecting the Visual Effects tab. The effects are divided into a group named Motions and Fades. To get an explanation and a sample of what the effects do, hover your mouse cursor over the thumbnails of the effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/click-video-tools-windows-editor.jpg"                      alt="click video tools windows editor"                ></p><p>The available effects include pixelate, ripple, and a simple fade in or fade out to black or white. Apply No Effect, the first thumbnail in the list of visual effects, after choosing the clip and the visual effect you wish to remove.</p><p>Step3Select the desired video portion, then click the Edit tab under Video Tools to fade the video sound. The ribbon’s initial part is devoted to audio controls. One drop-down choice is for fade in, and the other is for fade out. You may choose none, slow, medium, or quick for each of them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/desired-video-portion-windows-editor.jpg"                      alt="desired video portion windows editor"                ></p><p>Step4Select the Options option beneath Motion and Fades to fade your videos and the soundtrack. The first ribbon area is devoted to audio controls, much to what we saw for video sound. One drop-down choice is for fade in, and the other is for fade out. You may choose none, slow, medium, or quick for each of them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/fade-effect-windows-video-editor.jpg"                      alt="fade effect windows video editor"                ></p><p>It is pertinent to mention here that the windows video editor does not support the fading feature that is included in the transitions. It can be used for various things, however the editor lacks fading options. We thus provide an alternative technique for fading the movies and words on Windows or iOS platforms in the upcoming part.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136617/26400" target="_top" id="2136617">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136617" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136617/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Alternative-Way-to-Fade-Your-Video-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-Alternative-Way-to-Fade-Your-Video-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Alternative Way to Fade Your Video - Filmora"></a>Part 2: Alternative Way to Fade Your Video - <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>Almost every video editor has fade in and fade out effects but the features that Filmora provides are out of the box.

Especially when it is combined with the fade-out effect, frequently used to wrap up a shot, end a sequence, or the entire video clip. However, with Filmora, you can upload a picture, a GIF, or a video from your computer or paste in a link in the Filmora opening window including the Fading effects on both Audio and Video clips.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><strong>Steps to How to Fade in Filmora Video Editor</strong></p><p>Your meme video, GIF, or picture may include text.

What is the fade panel in Windows video editor?"></a>1. What is the fade panel in Windows video editor?</h3><p>In the windows video editor, there is a panel for basic video editing tools. But for fading in&#x2F;out of a video or text, there is no option available. The built-in windows tool does not have any option of ‘transition’. It straight forwardly moves from one video clip to the other without any sort of transition because Microsoft believe these transitions to be lame and unnecessary. Hence, they are not available. In case of Filmora, and other such tools, there is a straight up option for transitions where you can fade in and out with a lot of other cool stuff. For fading you can follow the method mentioned above in the article.</p><h3 id="2-How-do-I-fade-text-in-Windows-video-editor"><a href="#2-How-do-I-fade-text-in-Windows-video-editor" class="headerlink" title="2.

How do I fade out music in Windows video editor?</h3><p>There is no direct command for making the music or sound fade out but you can do it manually, that is, in the video where ever you want the music or sound to fade out is that you can trim that clip out and then divide into two more clips. You can take the first of the two clips and lower its sound and in the next clip, you can mute the clip, note: the clips must be kept small, otherwise it will sound quite weird. If the respective lengths of the clips are kept quite small, only then will the fade feel natural. Due to unavailability of a direct command, fading the music out can be a very taxing job.</p><h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>The built-in video editor for Windows does not have a direct option, therefore fading procedures cannot be utilized without downloading and installing other software, such as Filmora, which may assist with such problems. Filmora comes with built-in tools for text, video, and audio fading. In Filmora, there are at least four different ways to fade media.

Even though you are not a complete stranger to the term 4K, you might still be unaware of what it means.</p><p>In a nutshell, 4K is the highest resolution you can watch your movies and videos. The details are incredibly crisp, meaning you can see pimples or the pores on an actor’s face through the screen. However, the frame rate will significantly affect how you enjoy a 4K video.

Even though your viewers are not tech-savvy, they will definitely notice the difference.</p><p>Consider a video of a duck drinking water from a pond. If you film and playback the same video in 24, 30, and 60fps, you will see a noticeable difference, assuming your shutter speed is set according to the 180-degree shutter rule.</p><p>If you are filming quicker motions of wildlife and birds, you are better off sticking to higher resolutions to give the viewer a pleasant experience and ensure the motion is fluid.</p><p>On the other hand, lower frame rates like 24fps are ideal for human movements, which are not as smooth as wildlife. Suppose you used 60fps for a cinematic film or a TV show. The video would look a bit odd because that is not how we see things in the natural world. In addition, your viewers aren’t used to such smoothness.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934183/19272" target="_top" id="1934183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934183/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Viewing-Requirements-of-4K-Videos"><a href="#Viewing-Requirements-of-4K-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Viewing Requirements of 4K Videos"></a>Viewing Requirements of 4K Videos</h2><p>You may have heard about 4K videos and wondered what people mean by that term. In simple terms, a 4K video is a high-resolution video that is four times the usual 1080p HD video. When it comes to 4K videos, there are two standard resolutions. One of them is the standard for Digital Cinema which is 4096*2160 pixels. The other is for television and is 3840*2160 pixels.</p><p>To stream 4K content, you need a bandwidth between 10 and 20 Mbps. On the other hand, streaming platforms like Netflix require higher bandwidths of not less than 15 Mbps. In addition to the bandwidth we mentioned earlier, you need a 4KTV or 4K monitor.</p><p>This specification was brought up at the UHD Alliance, a union of more than 50 tech companies working together to support 4K content. Tech companies ought to ensure the devices they produce are compatible with 4K videos, which are becoming increasingly popular.</p><p>Below is a list of requirements any electronic device should fulfill before being termed a 4KTV or 4K monitor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4k-video-requirements.jpg"                      alt="requirements of 4k videos"                ></p><ul><li>A resolution of not less than 3840*2160.</li><li>A 10-bit color depth that allows for 1,024 shades of red, yellow, and blue.</li><li>A high dynamic range for color accuracy.</li><li>An excellent combination of black level and peak brightness.

The frame rate will also affect how the video looks. For instance, a frame rate lower than 24fps will make your video look unprofessional and of poor quality. The content will also flicker because there aren’t many still images per second.</p><p>On the other hand, a lower FPS causes the file size to be smaller, causing it to consume a lower bandwidth. The vice versa is also true. Now that you understand these facts, you might wonder which frame rate would be best for your 4K videos.</p><p>Research reveals that the most acceptable frame rate is 30fps and 60fps. This is because the motion will appear natural to the human eye without being too fast or unrealistic.</p><p>If you are wondering what is the best frame rate for 4k videos, we urge you to select 60fps because it contains more detail. The higher frame rate also makes the motion look very smooth and crisp. Perhaps you want to shoot a slow-motion video.

However, it is not a straightforward process either. There are numerous moving parts that ought to work harmoniously for your video to turn out perfect and guarantee your audience will have a pleasant viewing experience. Before we dive into choosing the best frame rate for your 4K videos, let’s help you understand the filmmaking process.</p><p>Most filmmakers and videographers see it fit to shoot videos in 120p or 4K. This step makes their work easier during the editing process. If the raw footage is in 4K, they can de-emphasize or retain specific plot points that would look great in the final video. However, not everyone is shooting a video for Hollywood. Therefore, shooting in 4K on your laptop for your YouTube channel might be difficult.</p><p>Below are some factors you should consider when choosing the best frame rate for a 4k video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/factors-for-choosing-frame-rate.jpg"                      alt="factors for choosing frame rate for videos"                ></p><h4 id="File-size"><a href="#File-size" class="headerlink" title="File size"></a>File size</h4><p>Shooting your video at a higher frame rate means more still images are packed into a single second of the video. Therefore, you will end up with a larger file size. If you want to shoot a video for your YouTube channel, it would be wise to stick to a smaller frame rate.</p><h4 id="Purpose"><a href="#Purpose" class="headerlink" title="Purpose"></a>Purpose</h4><p>It wouldn’t make sense to shoot a talking head video at more than 24fps. However, a higher frame rate would be ideal for a travel vlog, where the details need to be crisp.</p><h4 id="Medium-of-delivery"><a href="#Medium-of-delivery" class="headerlink" title="Medium of delivery"></a>Medium of delivery</h4><p>The standard frame rate for television is 24fps.

What Is Ray Tracing?"></a>Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?</h2><p>Ray Tracing is a powerful rendering technique that can create incredibly realistic lighting and shadows. By tracing the path of light, algorithms can simulate the way that light interacts with virtual objects in a computer-generated world.</p><p>This results in more lifelike shadows, reflections, and translucence. Ray Tracing has been responsible for the dramatic increase in realism we’ve seen in video games over the years, and its benefits are only becoming more apparent as technology improves.</p><p>In simple words, Ray Tracing is a computer graphics technique for generating realistic images and works by tracing the light’s path from the camera through the scene. This allows for accurate simulations of light interactions, such as reflection, refraction, and shadows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ray-tracing-technology.png"                      alt="ray tracing technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Overview-Of-Ray-Tracing"><a href="#Part-2-Overview-Of-Ray-Tracing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Overview Of Ray Tracing</h2><p>In this part, we will explain what Ray Tracing is from the following sides and for your better understanding.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Albrecht Dürer first gave the idea of Ray Tracing in the 16th century through his invention, the Dürer’s door. However, it was not until 1968 that Arthur Appel used a computer for the first time to create a shaded picture through Ray Tracing.</p><p>First conceptualized in 1969, Ray Tracing is a common technique used to create computer-generated graphics for movies and TV shows today. This is because studios can use the processing power of multiple computers to get the job done quickly and efficiently. However, even with this extra processing power, Ray Tracing can be a long and difficult process.</p><p>Despite the challenges, Ray Tracing is becoming increasingly popular due to computer hardware and software advances. And as technology continues to improve, we can expect to see even more realistic images in the future.</p><h3 id="Advantages"><a href="#Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h3><p>Here’re some advantages of Ray Tracing:</p><ol><li><strong>Realistic Rendering:</strong> Ray Tracing can create more realistic images than those created with traditional rendering techniques. This is because it calculates the light path more accurately, resulting in more realistic shadows, refraction, and reflections.</li><li><strong>Anti-aliasing And Depth Of Field:</strong> Ray Tracing can help you quickly get the anti-aliasing and depth of field effects.</li></ol><h3 id="Disadvantages"><a href="#Disadvantages" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages"></a>Disadvantages</h3><p>The downside of Ray Tracing technology is that it requires a lot of computing power to run, and it can be difficult to create more complex lighting effects like <a class="link"   href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2017/ENU/3DSMax/files/GUID-174FC56F-A781-4D0A-98D7-790D436E98AE-htm.html#:~:text=Caustics%20are%20the%20effects%20of,or%20refraction%20through%20another%20object.&text=To%20calculate%20caustics%2C%20the%20mental,by%20the%20default%20scanline%20renderer.%29" >caustics. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Does-Ray-Tracing-Work"><a href="#Part-3-How-Does-Ray-Tracing-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Ray Tracing In Adobe After Effects</h2><p>After the introduction of Ray Tracing, we will combine it with a popular video editor - Adobe After Effects to see how it works. Adobe After Effects is a useful and powerful tool for creating visual effects and animated graphics. Adobe introduced Ray Tracing or <strong>Ray-Traced 3D</strong> feature in After Effect to help graphic designers create photorealistic 3D images and render light and shadow. This feature was added in 2012 with the release of After Effects CS 6.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ray-tracing-in-adobe-after-effects.png"                      alt="ray tracing in adobe after effects"                ></p><p>However, the Ray Tracing feature was later removed from After Effects in 2020 due to multiple reasons:</p><ul><li>The Ray Tracing tool always faced bugs and glitches.</li><li>This feature did not work correctly if you were not using Adobe Media Encoder.</li><li>NVIDIA would change the standards from time to time.</li></ul><h3 id="Functions"><a href="#Functions" class="headerlink" title="Functions"></a>Functions</h3><p>Though as mentioned above, the Ray Tracing feature was removed in 2020, its advanced 3D features are still worth of introducing.

Extruded layers have a z-axis depth, making them three-dimensional. This extra dimension is viewable from all angles, even when the layer is rotated. In contrast, non-extruded layers have zero depth on the z-axis. So, they will disappear if you try to rotate them 90 degrees on the x or y-axis.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Ray-Traced-3D-Settings-In-Adobe-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-5-Ray-Traced-3D-Settings-In-Adobe-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

What Is Ray Tracing?"></a>Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?</h2><p>Ray Tracing is a powerful rendering technique that can create incredibly realistic lighting and shadows. By tracing the path of light, algorithms can simulate the way that light interacts with virtual objects in a computer-generated world.</p><p>This results in more lifelike shadows, reflections, and translucence. Ray Tracing has been responsible for the dramatic increase in realism we’ve seen in video games over the years, and its benefits are only becoming more apparent as technology improves.</p><p>In simple words, Ray Tracing is a computer graphics technique for generating realistic images and works by tracing the light’s path from the camera through the scene. This allows for accurate simulations of light interactions, such as reflection, refraction, and shadows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ray-tracing-technology.png"                      alt="ray tracing technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Overview-Of-Ray-Tracing-1"><a href="#Part-2-Overview-Of-Ray-Tracing-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

AOMedia is a consortium of major tech companies including Google, Microsoft, Netflix, and Amazon. The AV1 codec is an improvement on VP9 in several ways, most notably in its ability to compress video more efficiently.</p><p>Although the AV1 codec is still in the early stages of development, it is already being adopted by some major tech companies. Netflix has announced that it will start using AV1 for its streaming service, and Google has said that AV1 will be the default codec for YouTube.</p><h3 id="How-can-streaming-platforms-and-users-benefit-from-a-new-codec"><a href="#How-can-streaming-platforms-and-users-benefit-from-a-new-codec" class="headerlink" title="How can streaming platforms and users benefit from a new codec?"></a>How can streaming platforms and users benefit from a new codec?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-2.jpg"                      alt="watching netflix on tv"                ></p><p><strong>The importance of codecs</strong></p><p>A codec is a device that encodes and decodes digital audio signals. Without a codec, your audio would sound garbled and distorted. There are two metrics to take into account to judge the performance of video codecs: quality and bitrate.</p><h3 id="The-benefits-of-the-new-codec"><a href="#The-benefits-of-the-new-codec" class="headerlink" title="The benefits of the new codec"></a>The benefits of the new codec</h3><p>Two of the most popular video formats, provide high-quality video at a relatively low bit rate.</p><p>The new AV1 codec offers several benefits for streaming platforms and their users. Take a look at a few of them:</p><ol><li><strong>Lower bitrate</strong></li><li><strong>Reduced costs for encoding</strong></li></ol><p>For streaming platforms, AV1 could lead to reducing costs for encoding as well as increasing quality and compatibility. For users, AV1 could improve streaming quality, especially on mobile devices.</p><ol><li><strong>Smaller size with better quality</strong></li></ol><p><strong>AV1 files</strong> will take up less space on your hard drive or be smaller in file size when streamed online. Since AV1 can compress video files to a much smaller size without sacrificing quality, users will be able to save data when streaming video on their devices!</p><ol><li><strong>More efficient</strong></li></ol><p>AV1 will use less processing power to decode a video compared to other video codecs. As a result, the streaming platforms can save on bandwidth costs, which can be passed on to users in the form of lower subscription prices eventually.</p><ol><li><strong>Royalty-free</strong></li></ol><p>The ultimate goal of AOMedia is to develop an open and royalty-free video codec that can be used by anyone. So, you will have better video quality, lower bandwidth costs, and faster loading times.</p><p>AV1 is just one of the many new technologies that are revolutionizing online media delivery. With its superior quality and efficiency, AV1 is poised to become the standard codec for online video in the years to come where everyone can access more affordable and high-quality videos.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Trends-of-Codec-War-AV1"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Trends-of-Codec-War-AV1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Trends of Codec War AV1?"></a>Part 2: What are the Trends of Codec War AV1?</h2><p>As we have already discussed, AV1 is a newer codec that promises better compression. This video format has already been widely used and gaining traction in the streaming industry.

However, as the world moves towards more open standards for video codecs, there is growing concern that AV1 codec will be used to monopolize the market. While AV1 is free to use, it is encumbered by patents held by members of the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), which includes companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple.</p><h3 id="How-would-AV1-monopolize-the-market"><a href="#How-would-AV1-monopolize-the-market" class="headerlink" title="How would AV1 monopolize the market?"></a>How would AV1 monopolize the market?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-4.jpg"                      alt="a pile of us dollars"                ></p><p>The EU Commissions’ questionnaire, as reported by <a class="link"   href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-eu-antitrust-regulators-probing-tech-group-aoms-video-licensing-policy-2022-07-07/" >Reuters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, unveiled that the alliance and its members had been requiring companies to cross-license their patents for no charge to receive the AV1 format. These companies had no affiliation with AOM when AV1 was originally devised. This was a non-negotiable requisite for companies who owned patents that were necessary to contribute to the AV1 standard’s technical specifications.</p><p>As a result, this action is concerned to hinder innovation and thus prevents the new entities feasible to flourish. Therefore, there is a growing movement to antitrust AV1 which has been investigated by the European Commission.</p><h3 id="What-happened-after-the-AV1-Antitrust-Investigation"><a href="#What-happened-after-the-AV1-Antitrust-Investigation" class="headerlink" title="What happened after the AV1 Antitrust Investigation"></a>What happened after the AV1 Antitrust Investigation</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-5.jpg"                      alt="google logo"                ></p><p>The European Commission is looking into whether this licensing scheme violates antitrust law and whether the companies involved are colluding to keep AV1 closed off to competitors. The investigation is in its early stages, and no formal charges have been filed against Google at this time.</p><p>However, if the Commission finds that Google has indeed abused its market position, it could order Google to make changes to AV1 or face steep fines. Although the fines have yet to be determined, each company involved could ultimately pay up to 10% of their global turnover.</p><p>Nonetheless, this issue has shed light on the competitive landscape of the codec market. Well, although the outcome of the antitrust investigation is still uncertain, it is clear that it has the potential to shake up the codec market.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Should-You-Expect-in-the-Future"><a href="#Part-3-What-Should-You-Expect-in-the-Future" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Should You Expect in the Future?"></a>Part 3: What Should You Expect in the Future?</h2><h3 id="H-266-codec"><a href="#H-266-codec" class="headerlink" title="H.266 codec"></a>H.266 codec</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-6.jpg"                      alt="h.266 vvc logo"                ></p><p>H.266 is the next-generation video codec that is being developed to improve upon the current standard and the latest advances in video technology. We can expect H.266 to continue to evolve and be improved upon as time goes on. Some of their transcendence that you can look forward to:</p><ul><li><strong>Improve compression efficiency</strong></li></ul><p>H.266&#x2F;VVC is designed to improve compression efficiency by 20-50% over previous versions. You can have a video of the same file size and bit rate but make it look significantly better.</p><ul><li><strong>Inter-Layer Prediction (ILP) usage</strong></li></ul><p>The H.266 codec uses a new type of inter-frame prediction called Inter-Layer Prediction (ILP). ILP allows the codec to exploit the correlations between different layers of a video signal. Therefore, it gives better results on image quality and file size when you encode a video with the H.266 codec.</p><ul><li><strong>Higher-quality video</strong></li></ul><p>We can expect higher-quality video content to become more widespread. This new codec will also enable new types of content, such as virtual reality and 360-degree video, to be streamed and enjoyed by a wider audience.</p><h3 id="AV2-codec"><a href="#AV2-codec" class="headerlink" title="AV2 codec"></a>AV2 codec</h3><p>The AV2 codec is an improvement on the current AV1. The AV2 codec is said to be more efficient and have better quality than the AV1 codec. It is still in development and is not yet available for use.</p><p>Since this codec is expected to provide better quality video at lower bit rates than other codecs, it would be ideal for use in video applications such as streaming and video conferencing. So, what can we expect from the AV2 codec in the future? Here are a few things to look out for:</p><ul><li>Improved quality at lower bitrates</li><li>Wider adoption in streaming and conferencing applications</li><li>Continued development and improvement</li></ul><h2 id="FAQs-To-cater-to-people-also-ask"><a href="#FAQs-To-cater-to-people-also-ask" class="headerlink" title="FAQs: To cater to people also ask"></a>FAQs: To cater to people also ask</h2><h3 id="1-How-do-I-open-an-AV1-file"><a href="#1-How-do-I-open-an-AV1-file" class="headerlink" title="1.

We all know that some teachers handle grade school, and some handle high school level. We need to discover what kind of knowledge or skills your students hope to gain in your class learning the topic you presented. Try to use your book, or maybe add some research and then use that information to help you discuss with your students.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/know-your-target-audience.jpg"                      alt="know your target audience"                ></p><p>Things you need to remember before you proceed to the next step:</p><ul><li>Who is your audience? We, educators, already know our audience. It depends on the school and what level we are going to handle. It’s either grade school level or high school level.</li><li>What is your topic&#x2F;s? There are a lot of topics and subjects in the field of teaching but try to pick only one topic or subject to present to your class. For example, Computer Subject because I’m a computer teacher. I will be using this subject or topic about computers to create my instructional video for the class.</li><li>What is the learning objective or learning outcome of your video? The learning objective of your video is the outcome that captures precisely what knowledge, skills, and attitudes the students should be able to exhibit following the instructions.</li><li>How will your video benefit your audience? The students will learn and understand the lesson you are discussing, helping them gain knowledge of that subject to answer all the assignments, quizzes, or maybe an activity you will give them.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880931/19272" target="_top" id="1880931">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880931" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880931/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Write-a-Script"><a href="#Write-a-Script" class="headerlink" title="Write a Script"></a>Write a Script</h2><p>Once you know your audience and have the topic you need, it’s time to <strong>write a script</strong>. Think about your plan for presenting your video in your classes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/write-video-script.jpg"                      alt="write video script"                ></p><ul><li>Here are a few more writing script tips to help you in your classes:</li></ul><p>Go to the mirror and practice. This tip may help some teachers instead of calling their loved ones and getting feedback about the script they write.</p><ul><li>Explain what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. You are not only presenting the topic and explaining it but also showing the class what the topic is all about, which will be suitable for your students. Present some examples, pictures, or videos for them to know better what your discussion is all about.</li><li>Knowing your script 100% is important. Make sure that you already know your script before you record. If you forget something or make a mistake, go back to the beginning and repeat it correctly. Remember as a teacher that we are not allowed to make mistakes in the eyes of the students. So, double-check everything before you record it and show it to the class.</li></ul><h2 id="Record-the-Narration"><a href="#Record-the-Narration" class="headerlink" title="Record the Narration"></a>Record the Narration</h2><p>After writing your script, let’s try to <strong>record the narration</strong>. You don’t need any application software where you can record the narration. Simply using your mobile phone and having a good background is enough.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/record-narration.jpg"                      alt="record narration"                ></p><p>Using a microphone to record the narration is necessary. Getting those headphones with one connected microphone is good. Some of that has noise cancellation, providing a much better sound quality while recording and ensuring that your videos don’t contain background noise. Then, find a quiet place to record. Explain to your family members that no one will ever talk loud or shout while you are recording the narration.</p><p>Once you are ready to hit that record button, speak clearly. Nobody is perfect, so it’s ok if you make a mistake. You don’t need to start over, just pause and start again. You can remove the error or mistake by editing your finished product. Make sure your narration will be the same on the screen while recording your video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/1062450/7443" target="_top" id="1062450">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-1062450" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/1062450/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Record-and-Edit-your-Video"><a href="#Record-and-Edit-your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Record and Edit your Video"></a>Record and Edit your Video</h2><p>The first thing you need to do in <strong>recording your video</strong> is to clean up your computer screen and close all the unnecessary applications. You need to turn off also the notifications that will pop up on your computer before you start recording. You can also add your recorded narration to your video.</p><p>Here are a few simple tips for <strong>editing your video</strong>:</p><ul><li>Add some interactive elements like motions to highlight key points of your video.</li><li>Adding music to your video is optional but may elevate a decent video to the next level. Pick something cheery. You want your audience to feel good while learning.</li></ul><h2 id="The-Video-Duration"><a href="#The-Video-Duration" class="headerlink" title="The Video Duration"></a>The Video Duration</h2><p>I’d say it’s one of the first things students look at before they click the ‘play’ button of the video. It will benefit both teacher and the students if the video is brief and direct to the point. Some students are more likely to want a short video, or maybe let’s focus on the time between 20 - 30 minutes video, where they can watch and learn on any platform, anytime. After that, you can add time by adding other pieces of information and giving activities and assignments.</p><h2 id="Be-Yourself"><a href="#Be-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="Be Yourself"></a>Be Yourself</h2><p>Be yourself, and don’t be afraid to make mistakes sometimes. Make sure that your personality shines throughout the video. Try to research how some teachers or maybe some speakers speak naturally and have a conversational manner with an enthusiastic tone.</p><p>When you are recording yourself talking, look right at the camera so students can feel eye contact with you, even if it is online. Sometimes we forget the words we need to say to the class, so try to prepare a note next to your webcam. The messages you prepare will help you don’t look away from the camera all the time. Don’t pretend to the class that you’re reading something, just talk naturally as you would in real classrooms.</p><h2 id="Sharing-your-Video"><a href="#Sharing-your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Sharing your Video"></a>Sharing your Video</h2><p>Instead of sharing your recorded video with your students, you can also share it directly to online video platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Vimeo or save the video as a local file to upload on a social media platform. They can go there and watch the video. You can also upload your file to the school learning management system like Google Classroom. Please take note of this; before sending the recorded video to your students, share it with first to a few people to get some video feedback about what you created. This might help you ensure that your message is clear and that your video accomplishes your goals for your students.</p><p>There’s a chance that your recorded video doesn’t meet your requirements or you are not satisfied with that for the first time. Don’t worry; try it again, even if you recorded it once or several times. You need to trust yourself by doing it because we are teachers; we are doing our best for the students to learn something from us.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Top-5-Free-Online-Video-Filter-Editors-Improve-Your-Videos-with-Filters"><a href="#Top-5-Free-Online-Video-Filter-Editors-Improve-Your-Videos-with-Filters" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Free Online Video Filter Editors: Improve Your Videos with Filters"></a>Top 5 Free Online Video Filter Editors: Improve Your Videos with Filters</h2><p>In the era of digital storytelling, everyone desires to make their content stand out.

This Article Will Show You some Knowledge About Slow Motion Photography</h2><p>Scenes that might otherwise be monotonous can be made more interesting by the use of slow-motion photography in movies and television shows. For instance, a battle sequence between two characters can be portrayed in its entirety, but if it is later replayed in slow motion, the intensity of the action is amplified significantly.</p><p>Let’s dive in!</p><h2 id="1-What-is-slow-motion"><a href="#1-What-is-slow-motion" class="headerlink" title="1. What is slow motion?"></a>1. What is slow motion?</h2><p>Filmmakers use the slow-motion effect to create the illusion that the passage of time has been slowed down on the screen. In the early 20th century, an Austrian priest named August Musger was the one who came up with the idea. Playing normally recorded material at a slower pace is another method for creating the illusion of slow motion.</p><p>When a film is recorded at 25 frames per second, but played back at 24 frames per second, it will seem as if it is being shown in slow motion because all of the movements will be slightly slower than when they were actually performed. This is because the film was recorded at 25 frames per second, but the playback was done at 24 frames per second.</p><p>Because there are not enough frames to show all of the details of each frame when a 24-frame animation is played at a 25-frame rate (or a 30-frame animation at a 32-frame rate), certain frames have to be repeated (every 5th one in this case). When there is a dramatic event taking place, this manipulation of the film speed makes the action on screen appear even more dramatic or “tensioned.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-a-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="what is a slow motion video"                ></p><h2 id="2-Understanding-frame-rates"><a href="#2-Understanding-frame-rates" class="headerlink" title="2. Understanding frame rates"></a>2. Understanding frame rates</h2><p>When filming video, there are a set number of frames per second that you can choose from. One picture is all you get when you take a still photograph. Click. That is only one example. A frame is the name of that picture. With video, however, you take 30 or 24 images per second, which you then combine. You now have footage.</p><p>The video is a combination of tens of thousands of frames or images that are flashing before your eyes. With a normal frame rate of 24 frames per second, you are essentially taking 24 pictures per second and stitching them together to create video. When you stretch it out in post for slow motion, you double or triple the frame rate, which results in more images per second and eliminates empty gaps and jarring actions.</p><p>This is how video that has been sped up for slow motion may still preserve its quality. But you can’t just choose a frame rate based on taste. Frame rates vary depending on the different types of emotions. 60 fps will do if the video is a slo-mo of a person’s emotion. However, if your shot contains a lot of movement and you want to show it, such as when automobiles collide or explode, you may require a higher frame rate, such as 120 fps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/understand-frame-rates.jpg"                      alt="understand frame rates"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130875/7443" target="_top" id="2130875">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130875" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130875/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Post-processing"><a href="#3-Post-processing" class="headerlink" title="3. Post processing"></a>3. Post processing</h2><p>This is when it gets a bit complicated. Some cameras come equipped with a slow-motion feature. To capture the video in slow motion at a higher frame rate, go to your settings. You might not have this built-in slow-motion feature in other models.</p><p>Therefore, even though the footage was taken at a higher frame rate, the camera is playing the movie back at the same pace it was shot at, so when you shoot at a higher frame rate, you end up with footage of a normal speed. There is a solution to that. The footage’s speed can be adjusted during post-production.</p><p>The 24&#x2F;30 fps editing timelines are pre-set. The majority of the video you capture at this frame rate plays back just nicely on this timeline. You must stretch out video that was shot at a higher frame rate to match this timeline, though. That effectively doubles or triples the length of a video, depending on the multiple of the timeline’s typical frame rate.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/post-processing-filmora.jpg"                      alt="post processing filmora"                ></p><h2 id="4-Lighting"><a href="#4-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="4. Lighting"></a>4. Lighting</h2><p>While watching TV or movies, you might have observed anything. The majority of the extremely slow photos happen in broad daylight. Not after dark or in dimly lit areas. The reason for this is that sufficient lighting is required in order to capture motion. Lighting becomes crucial as your frame rate exceeds 300 frames per second. Therefore, if you must take these pictures, you must do so in a studio environment with lots of artificial lighting.</p><p>To create that cinematic magic, you can use high CRI lighting. On the screen, a flickering light may spell doom. Flickering lights have the potential to damage slow-motion film even though they would be OK for any other scene. Because there is no risk of voltage fluctuation, LED lights are a safe bet. The reason for this is that some models do not require an electrical outlet to function. Prior to departure, make sure you have checked each and every light.</p><p>If you are filming during the day and you point your camera toward the sun, you may end up with a significant amount of glare that cannot be hidden up in the post-production stage nor can it be ignored. This is not merely a problem that occurs throughout the daytime. Flares can also be obtained from moving vehicles and various other sources of light. If you use a flat lens when you’re out at night, you can eliminate the risk of something like that happening.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/choose-light-for-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="choose light for slow motion video"                ></p><h2 id="5-Why-use-slow-motion"><a href="#5-Why-use-slow-motion" class="headerlink" title="5. Why use slow motion?"></a>5. Why use slow motion?</h2><p>When you first begin working with slow-motion video, you need to ask yourself, “What exactly is the purpose behind me choosing this effect?” Once you have an answer to that question, you may move on to the next step.</p><p><strong>In most cases, there are often two primary causes for it.</strong></p><p>1. It makes sense to present emotions on the screen for a longer period of time in order for the audience to be able to absorb and comprehend it in its whole if they are shown for a longer period of time since moments that are packed with emotions seem to endure longer than ordinary ones.</p><p>2. The second strategy is to draw attention to striking visuals that you might have overlooked in other circumstances and that contribute significantly to the aesthetic value of your setting. A flutter of the eyelid, a butterfly stretching its wings, rains falling on a flower petal, shards of fire breaking free, etc. are all examples of how quickly things may happen. You need to have a good reason for using slow motion, and you shouldn’t abuse the effect too much too. You should only do so at those moments where it makes logical sense to do so.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/draw-attention-with-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="draw attention with slow motion video"                ></p><p>Subconscious slow-motion. Overusing or misusing a function ruins its appeal. Filming isn’t an exact science, but it does nothing unnecessary. For a cinematic effect, slow-motion should be introduced carefully.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Make-Super-Easy-Coin-Magic-With-Filmora"><a href="#Make-Super-Easy-Coin-Magic-With-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Make Super Easy Coin Magic With Filmora"></a>Make Super Easy Coin Magic With Filmora</h2><p>Do you want to become a magician in your videos?

Maybe it was too long, or you wanted to draw out an exciting part of the video without having to watch the boring parts.</p><p>In this article, we will be showing you how to use FFmpeg to speed up and slow down your videos using CLI. You’ll also find some other useful FFmpeg commands that you can use on your videos.</p><p>Finally, we will explain how to automate these commands so that you can run them on all your videos with ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-1.jpg"                      alt="how to automate these commands"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-FFmpeg"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is FFmpeg?"></a>Part 1. <a class="link"   href="https://ffmpeg.org/about.html" >What is FFmpeg? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>FFmpeg is a free and open-source cross-platform software project that can record, convert, and stream audio and video. It was developed by Fabrice Bellard in 2000. It has since become one of the most popular tools for transcoding media content on Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, Windows NT, and more.</p><p>One of its lesser-known capabilities is to speed up or slow down videos in just about any design you can think of — with either the audio or the video synced to the other if desired.</p><h3 id="Uses-of-FFmpeg"><a href="#Uses-of-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Uses of FFmpeg"></a><a class="link"   href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-ffmpeg-installation-use-cases/" >Uses of FFmpeg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>FFMPEG is a command-line tool that can manipulate and transcode video files. Its uses are as follows:</p><ul><li>FFmpeg can create, trim, join or separate video clips on the fly and encode them into formats including MPEG, VOB, M2TS, TS, RMVB, or AVI.</li><li>It can be used for Video processing, Video packaging support, Video compression, Audio, and Video container support, FFplay, and FFprobe.</li><li>It also has extensive options for altering the look of an image in just about any way imaginable. Whether you want to change the brightness, hue, saturation, or perform multiple operations like subsampling (resizing) without reducing quality—the list goes on!</li></ul><p>You could think of it as the Swiss army knife for video manipulation tasks. The interface might seem intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it, all commands are broken down into simple English phrases.</p><p>The most important thing to know before getting started with this is how to use FFmpeg’s -i and -v flags for input and output, respectively. To apply effects like slow motion playback or fast motion playback, use these flags in tandem with one another when specifying which file should be edited.</p><h3 id="Benefits-and-Disadvantages-of-FFmpeg"><a href="#Benefits-and-Disadvantages-of-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Benefits and Disadvantages of FFmpeg"></a>Benefits and Disadvantages of FFmpeg</h3><p>FFmpeg has many benefits over other video editing software because it is free and open source, meaning that you have access to the code so that you can modify it if needed. Thus, it’s a better option when compared to other video editing software such as Avidemux, QuickTime Pro 7, and Adobe Premiere Elements 12. Some of these benefits include:</p><ul><li>Being able to edit videos on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac OS X);</li><li>FFmpeg has features to speed up and slow down video;</li><li>Being able to convert from one format into another seamlessly;</li><li>An extensive amount of features are at your disposal.</li></ul><p>Some of the drawbacks are that some settings are not configurable, like with YouTube’s built-in editor. The main disadvantage, though, would be the lengthiness of the program’s installation process: not only do you need to download FFmpeg itself but also three external libraries like libx264, libmp3lame, and libfaac; then you must compile all six packages before the installation completes. Luckily this process doesn’t take very long.</p><p>Another possible disadvantage is the time required for downloading the various resources since they may not be readily available on standard file hosting sites such as Mediafire or Dropbox (though they can be found through third-party websites). If you’re looking for something more robust than Windows Movie Maker or iMovie, we recommend checking out FFmpeg.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Speed-Up-a-Video-in-FFmpeg"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Speed-Up-a-Video-in-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Let’s take a further look at what AV1 is and what you need to know about this new video codec.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-1.jpg"                      alt="av1 logo"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Where-does-it-come-from"><a href="#Part-1-Where-does-it-come-from" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Where does it come from?"></a>Part 1: Where does it come from?</h2><p>AV1 (AOMedia Video 1) is a new video compression format that is being developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia). AOMedia is a consortium of major tech companies including Google, Microsoft, Netflix, and Amazon. The AV1 codec is an improvement on VP9 in several ways, most notably in its ability to compress video more efficiently.</p><p>Although the AV1 codec is still in the early stages of development, it is already being adopted by some major tech companies. Netflix has announced that it will start using AV1 for its streaming service, and Google has said that AV1 will be the default codec for YouTube.</p><h3 id="How-can-streaming-platforms-and-users-benefit-from-a-new-codec"><a href="#How-can-streaming-platforms-and-users-benefit-from-a-new-codec" class="headerlink" title="How can streaming platforms and users benefit from a new codec?"></a>How can streaming platforms and users benefit from a new codec?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-2.jpg"                      alt="watching netflix on tv"                ></p><p><strong>The importance of codecs</strong></p><p>A codec is a device that encodes and decodes digital audio signals. Without a codec, your audio would sound garbled and distorted. There are two metrics to take into account to judge the performance of video codecs: quality and bitrate.</p><h3 id="The-benefits-of-the-new-codec"><a href="#The-benefits-of-the-new-codec" class="headerlink" title="The benefits of the new codec"></a>The benefits of the new codec</h3><p>Two of the most popular video formats, provide high-quality video at a relatively low bit rate.</p><p>The new AV1 codec offers several benefits for streaming platforms and their users. Take a look at a few of them:</p><ol><li><strong>Lower bitrate</strong></li><li><strong>Reduced costs for encoding</strong></li></ol><p>For streaming platforms, AV1 could lead to reducing costs for encoding as well as increasing quality and compatibility. For users, AV1 could improve streaming quality, especially on mobile devices.</p><ol><li><strong>Smaller size with better quality</strong></li></ol><p><strong>AV1 files</strong> will take up less space on your hard drive or be smaller in file size when streamed online. Since AV1 can compress video files to a much smaller size without sacrificing quality, users will be able to save data when streaming video on their devices!</p><ol><li><strong>More efficient</strong></li></ol><p>AV1 will use less processing power to decode a video compared to other video codecs. As a result, the streaming platforms can save on bandwidth costs, which can be passed on to users in the form of lower subscription prices eventually.</p><ol><li><strong>Royalty-free</strong></li></ol><p>The ultimate goal of AOMedia is to develop an open and royalty-free video codec that can be used by anyone. So, you will have better video quality, lower bandwidth costs, and faster loading times.</p><p>AV1 is just one of the many new technologies that are revolutionizing online media delivery. With its superior quality and efficiency, AV1 is poised to become the standard codec for online video in the years to come where everyone can access more affordable and high-quality videos.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Trends-of-Codec-War-AV1"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Trends-of-Codec-War-AV1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Trends of Codec War AV1?"></a>Part 2: What are the Trends of Codec War AV1?</h2><p>As we have already discussed, AV1 is a newer codec that promises better compression.

As many video editing pros present on Tiktok, the miniature effect is a fun way to brighten up your photography or video shots. For example, when taking a video or a time-lapse of a landscape, we always have a bigger depth of field, so most objects in the frame are in focus.</p><p>However, when we film a miniature model, the depth of field is shallow. So, we only see some objects in focus, and the rest is blurry. This visual trick makes our brain believe that the big landscape we’re seeing is actually a tiny model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-2.jpg"                      alt="a miniature effect for landscape"                ></p><p>To create a miniature look, we can use specific effects to fake a shallow depth of field, and then the landscape view will look like a tiny model. While some keys to notice before making the miniature effect are:</p><ul><li>It utilizes <strong>selective blur</strong> to make things appear like <strong>small</strong></li><li>The miniature effect works best for footage filmed from <strong>a high angle</strong>.</li><li>The tiny effect is usually used in <strong>drone footage, time lapses</strong>, or <strong>landscape photography</strong>.</li></ul><p>Are you all set to add miniature effects to your video and make film-like shots?

Here, you’ll see a histogram with the brightest point on the right and the darkest point on the left. From our example, you can see that the video has more dark pixels than bright ones. Horizontally, the histogram shows you how many pixels are in a certain range of brightness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-2.jpg"                      alt="read and study the histogram"                ></p><h5 id="Step3-Adjust-the-image-colors-3"><a href="#Step3-Adjust-the-image-colors-3" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Adjust the image colors"></a>Step3 Adjust the image colors</h5><p>Once you’ve understood the histogram, look for pure black and white parts on the video clip. For example, in this video, you can see that the roofs are pure black and the boat at the bottom-right corner is pure white.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/pure-blacks-and-whites.gif"                      alt="adjust the image colors"                ></p><p>After finding the white and black parts in the video, go to the <strong>Light</strong> section, then adjust the <strong>Highlights</strong> to see if you can get a pure white on the boat. If the boat or any other image of your choice doesn’t look pure white, increase the <strong>Whites</strong> slide to make it whiter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-3.jpg"                      alt="go to the light section"                ></p><p>Now adjust the <strong>Shadows</strong> settings to reduce the effect and make the roofs look closer to pure black. If you want the roofs to look darker, drag the <strong>Blacks</strong> slider to the left.</p><p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Ensure that the darkest and brightest points don’t cross the broken lines on the edge, or the video will start losing details.</p><h5 id="Step4-Adjust-the-color-saturation-3"><a href="#Step4-Adjust-the-color-saturation-3" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Adjust the color saturation"></a>Step4 Adjust the color saturation</h5><p>Does your video still look a little flat? Probably yes! In that case, click the <strong>Color</strong> section and adjust the <strong>Saturation</strong> slider to the right to make the video less flat. Saturation simply means how colorful a video clip is to the viewer. Apart from the color saturation, you can also adjust the <strong>Vibrance</strong> to make your video objects look more colorful.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-4.jpg"                      alt="adjust the color saturation"                ></p><h5 id="Step5-Preview-and-compare-the-video-3"><a href="#Step5-Preview-and-compare-the-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Preview and compare the video"></a>Step5 Preview and compare the video</h5><p>Now it’s time to check and compare the results.

After that, you’ll see many export options you can do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-1.jpg"                      alt="open the export box"                ></p><p><strong>Export Video Platform</strong></p><p>If you want your video to end up on YouTube, you can click on the “YouTube” option, sign in, and enter all the basic metadata you need for your YouTube video. Then you can click “Export”, and the video will go straight to YouTube. Also, you can have all of your privacy settings, descriptions, and everything else.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-2.jpg"                      alt="export video platform"                ></p><p>Similar to YouTube, you can do the same thing if you want to export your video on Vimeo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-3.jpg"                      alt="export your video on vimeo"                ></p><p><strong>Export and Burn Video into DVD</strong></p><p>You can also directly burn your video to a DVD. Even though video to DVD isn’t as common as it used to be, it’s still nice to be able to do it, especially if you like making DVDs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-4.jpg"                      alt="export and burn video into dvd"                ></p><p><strong>Export Video to Other Devices</strong></p><p>Go to the “Devices” option if you want to export your video to specific devices with everything looking good on that particular device. For instance, if you want to export your video to iPhone, you can see the size will be 41MB, and the resolution will be 1080p. All those things are going to look much better on an iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-5.jpg"                      alt="export video to other devices"                ></p><p>You can also adjust the quality of your video based on your needs by clicking on “Setting.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-6.jpg"                      alt="adjust the quality of video"                ></p><p><strong>Export Videos in High Res Quality</strong></p><p>In the “Format” option you can choose the file extension, the format, or the codec. Exporting your video based on format is good if you prefer to save your video on your computer since maybe you may upload your video on YouTube, Instagram or other social media platforms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-7.jpg"                      alt="export videos in high res quality"                ></p><p>You can choose “Apple Prores” if you want the least amount of compression possible and don’t care about the file size. For example, if you want to export a video from Filmora and then import it into another video editor without losing too much quality, you should definitely choose “Apple Prores.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-8.jpg"                      alt="choose apple prores"                ></p><p>Before exporting, there is the option to upload to the cloud. If you do not know what it is, Wondershare has its own Drive, which allows you to save and remotely view your video files.</p><p>In the meantime, if you have a decent PC, you can enable “Hardware acceleration for video encoding.” This option will utilize as much computer power as you have to export the video and make the process significantly faster. Once everything is finished, click “Export.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-9.jpg"                      alt="click export"                ></p><p>When you click Export, you can see the progress with thumbnails and everything. Lastly, your video has been exported successfully when the exporting process reaches 100%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-10.jpg"                      alt="finish exporting video"                ></p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Indeed, there are many options to export your video using Filmora. If you wish to export your video directly to YouTube, simply select the YouTube option in the Export box. Meanwhile, if you want to export your video on your computer and upload it to various social media platforms, it’s much better to export it with a format option.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Step-By-Step-Guide-To-Creating-Halftone-Effects-In-Photoshop"><a href="#Step-By-Step-Guide-To-Creating-Halftone-Effects-In-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Step-By-Step Guide To Creating Halftone Effects In Photoshop"></a>Step-By-Step Guide To Creating Halftone Effects In Photoshop</h2><p>Halftone is a technique that uses dots to create a deliberate screen-like image and textured effect. In recent years, it has become trendy in digital design.</p><p>This effect is often used in magazines, newspapers, and other printed materials. When applied correctly, it can add depth and dimension to an image, resulting in a softer, more pleasing, and appealing look.</p><p>So, if you have ever wanted to add interesting effects and textures to your images, but weren’t sure where to start, then keep on reading to discover and learn everything you need to know regarding <strong>creating the halftone printing effect in Photoshop.</strong></p><p>Without further ado, let’s get started!</p><h2 id="What-Are-Halftone-Effects"><a href="#What-Are-Halftone-Effects" class="headerlink" title="What Are Halftone Effects?"></a>What Are Halftone Effects?</h2><p>Before we know <a href="#_How_To_Use">how to create a halftone effect in Photoshop</a>, let’s have a basic understanding of it first.</p><p>In the 19th century, William Henry Fox Talbot introduced the <strong>halftone screen printing</strong> effect to create the illusion of tones in black and white images.</p><p>The halftone originated from printers who previously only worked with cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (<a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK%5Fcolor%5Fmodel" >CMYK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>). The solid colors were tiny dots placed together closely with continuous tones that remained unchanged. From the mixing and matching of these four colors, a wide range of colors emerged.</p><p>The effect is usually created by putting dots of ink on paper in different sizes and positions.

The same is applicable for gamers who live stream their gameplay on Twitch. Instead of physically hanging green screens in the background, some video creators opt for virtual green screens. Yes, it is possible to shoot videos with a virtual green background, and you do not have to buy screen greens and deal with the problem of hanging them in the background.</p><p>The concept of using virtual greenscreen is rather new, but it is getting popular among amateur video creators who do not want to invest in purchasing green screens initially. When you use a virtual background to shoot your video, the actual physical background is replaced completely with a virtual green background. Thereafter, you have to replace this virtual background with anything by using a video editor. In this article, we will illustrate how to use a virtual green screen to shoot video.</p><h2 id="1-Free-Virtual-Green-Screen"><a href="#1-Free-Virtual-Green-Screen" class="headerlink" title="1. Free Virtual Green Screen"></a>1. Free Virtual Green Screen</h2><p>In order to shoot a video with green virtual background, you cannot shoot your video with your regular camera app. Otherwise, your physical background will get recorded, and replacing that through video editor is going to be time-consuming. Therefore, there are specific apps available through which you have to shoot your video so that your physical background gets completely replaced by virtual greenscreen in real-time.</p><p>Snap Camera from Snapchat is a free app through which you can shoot your video to get a virtual green background. The app comes with a Green Screen filter that makes this virtual background effect possible. However, you will need a camera recording app that can record your video with green screen effects from Snap Camera. We will be using OBS Studio for recording the video which is also available for free. Snap Camera is compatible with Windows 10 and Mac 10.11+, and hence, you can use it to shoot video from your computer webcam. Here are the steps to follow –</p><p>Step 1: Download and install <a class="link"   href="https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/" >Snap Camera app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer.</p><p>Step 2: Set up your webcam perfectly so that its angle is direct to your face.</p><p>Step 3: Open Snap Camera app and you will see yourself on the app through your webcam. Select the appropriate Lens(filter) and you have to select Green Screen Snap Filter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-virtual-green-screen.jpg"                      alt="free virtual green screen"                ></p><p>Step 4: You should see a green virtual background by now.

Many of its customers adore it, and it has some incredible capabilities that you’d find incompetent editing software. They’ve effectively opened up the realm of LUTs to iPhone and iPad users.</p><p>LumaFusion LUTs are individual files that act as containers in LumaFusion. This container file includes standard LUT data as well as LumaFusion-specific color preset data. A LumaFusion LUT Preset file is similar to a Super LUT. LumaFusion can only employ one standard LUT at a time; however, LumaFusion LUT presets enable simultaneous Color Grading and Color Corrections.</p><h2 id="How-will-LUTs-help-with-color-correction-in-Lumafusion"><a href="#How-will-LUTs-help-with-color-correction-in-Lumafusion" class="headerlink" title="How will LUTs help with color correction in Lumafusion"></a>How will LUTs help with color correction in Lumafusion</h2><p>Colors in today’s cameras are vibrant, but they may continuously be improved. Color correction corrects the color that’s already there, whether it’s boosting the exposure to brighten a darker photo or increasing the saturation to make the colors pop. Color correction in other NLEs can be difficult, but not in LumaFusion.</p><p>The Color Presets tab in the Color &amp; Effects section is where you begin color correcting footage. There are various presets from which to pick. I wouldn’t use these settings on my videos because they’re too stylized, but they’re there. You may alter any of the presets to your taste, so some of the more dramatic ones can be toned down. By picking the original setting, purists can color-fix their raw footage without using LumaFusion. Moving the sliders till the color seems perfect is all that’s required from there.</p><p>Exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, mid-tones, and saturation and hue are all controlled by sliders. The color sliders can be used for a more forceful approach. But proceed with caution. The sliders are delicate, and it’s easy to overdo them. Play around with the sliders until you get the look you want. If you don’t like it, toss it in the trashcan and start over.</p><p>Color grading and color correction are not interchangeable terms. Color correction is a technical requirement, but color grading is primarily creative. You’ll have no command over the color grading process if you’re working with film material where primary colors aren’t even visible. Before diving into the creative LUTs, make sure you complete adequate color correcting.</p><p>Color grading, unlike color correction, adjusts the shot’s color to modify the atmosphere or feel. The only way to do that in LumaFusion is to play around with the color sliders under the Color Presets tab, but that’s not ideal. As previously stated, the three sliders are sensitive and limited. LumaFusion isn’t designed for color grading, which is OK. Thankfully, LumaFusion allows you to use LUTs.</p><p>Always color correct your footage before utilizing any LUTS, which entails changing the White-balance, Highlights, Contrast, and Shadows. Do not apply the LUTS to your footage directly.</p><h2 id="How-to-use-LUTs-in-Lumafusion"><a href="#How-to-use-LUTs-in-Lumafusion" class="headerlink" title="How to use LUTs in Lumafusion?"></a>How to use LUTs in Lumafusion?</h2><p>Videographers, colorists, and editors use LUTs because they are efficient. Rather than starting from zero every time you work on a video editing project, you may speed up the color grading process using a LUT with predefined color profiles. It’s elementary to import LUTs. Simply import the preset files into LumaFusion and add the preset to your footage like an Instagram filter.</p><p>The Import button in the Color &amp; Effects editor is the easiest way to load LUTs.</p><ol><li>Double click on any video&#x2F;photo clip on the timeline to access the Clip Editors.</li><li>At the bottom of the Clip Editor UI, select the Color &amp; Effects tab.</li><li>The import button is located directly below the effect preset library.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/lumafusion-luts-1.jpg"                      alt="lumafusion Lut"                ></p><p>How to use LUTs in Lumafuison</p><p>LUTs must be loaded via the LumaFX clip editor at the moment.

Todd Blankenship has designed a fresh new set of FREE LUTs for Shutterstock, which is their latest addition. Todd chose distinct looks from films and pictures that inspire his daily work to create this bundle with attention and love. There are many options, and these looks will offer you a great place to start when it comes to grading your footage. They recently published an in-depth evaluation of Photon.io, a new color grading tool. Todd Blankenship, who ended up utilizing the tool to create these LUTs, wrote the initial review. The pack has been fine-tuned to replicate some clean, cinematic looks that you may use as a jumping-off point for your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/lumafusion-luts-7.png"                      alt="lumafusion Lut - PremiumBeat Free LUTs"                ></p><p>PremiumBeat Free LUTs</p><h3 id="5-Frank-Glencairn-free-LUT"><a href="#5-Frank-Glencairn-free-LUT" class="headerlink" title="5.

Frank Glencairn has made a nice K-Tone LUT that is meant to look like vintage Kodachrome film. This film grade, which was formerly popular among photographers and filmmakers, has fallen out of favor due to the rise of digital cameras.

YouTube currently boasts more than 2 billion video views per week. It can also provide a low-cost to no-cost solution to making a social marketing channel for your hobby or business. Most of the time, success is not achieved overnight.</p><p>Creating a YouTube channel that will be successful takes a lot of time, effort, planning, and work to kickstart it from zero. In this article, we will be covering the most important topics you have to remember when becoming a successful YouTube star.</p><ol><li><a href="#Part4-01">Watch Time</a></li><li><a href="#Part4-02">Average view duration</a></li><li><a href="#Part4-03">Audience Retention</a></li></ol><ul><li>Promotion and Marketing</li></ul><ol><li><a href="#Part5-01">YouTube’s Community Tab</a>  </li><li><a href="#Part5-02">Social Media Advertisements</a></li></ol><p>With that said, let’s get into it!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-01.jpg"                      alt="Successful YouTuber"                ></p><p>Successful YouTuber</p><h2 id="1-Understand-‘Success’-Means"><a href="#1-Understand-‘Success’-Means" class="headerlink" title="1. Understand ‘Success’ Means"></a>1. Understand ‘Success’ Means</h2><p>YouTube’s success is based on the premise that all visitors need the same thing. Search, find, and leave as fast as possible. Kind of like a store. But YouTube visitors have much more diverse needs than you might think. Some come to watch short clips of cats doing silly things, others to view TV shows or how to learn an instrument, cooking, maintain a car, and so much more.</p><p>The way your success is measured is by the number of viewers you get onto your channel. No matter what kind of content you upload, whether it’s about music, education, when you turn viewers into subscribers, dedicated fans, and supporters, that is how you can measure your success and how you can get as many new people through the door and make them stick around because they love what you do and what value you are to them. We are going more in-depth in the other stages of this article about analytics and measurements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-02.jpg"                      alt="Understanding What &#39;Success&#39; Means"                ></p><p>Understand What ‘Success’ Means</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151884/7443" target="_top" id="2151884">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151884" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151884/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Create-Your-Plan"><a href="#2-Create-Your-Plan" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Your Plan"></a>2. Create Your Plan</h2><p>When it comes to building a successful YouTube channel, consistency is super important. You are more likely to gain success if you have a well-thought-out plan and a strategy for uploading content. Instead of uploading once per month, try once per week if your time schedule allows it so your new viewers know when to expect a new video. Planning is super important because it will allow you to stick to a schedule. If you have a lot of time to create videos, people tend to get used to that schedule. Once you’re planning becomes less structured because of lack of time, it can confuse viewers as consistency is important. People do not like change, or it will take time for them to get used to a new schedule, especially if it changes often.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-03.jpg"                      alt="Creating Your Plan"                ></p><p>Create Your Plan</p><h2 id="3-Make-Your-YouTube-Videos"><a href="#3-Make-Your-YouTube-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Make Your YouTube Videos"></a>3. Make Your YouTube Videos</h2><p>After you created your plan, your strategy, and all the preparation, it is time to start filming! We highly recommend working with an upload schedule, so you know which videos to create and when they have to be finished. Try to have a good overall layout and theme for your videos from the start so people know who you are and what you do. Once you started filming you can continue the process and keep producing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                      alt="Filmora Note"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have less time, you can create more videos in one filming session so you have a bulk library you can release over the period when you don’t have time for creating content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-04.jpg"                      alt="Making Your YouTube Videos"                ></p><p>Make Your YouTube Videos</p><p>It’s highly recommended to write down a list of topics for videos so you can have your same recording set ready to go for whenever you start shooting. If you are able to keep a dedicated space to keep your set, that’s a huge plus instead of having to tear everything down and setting up again each time you film and it gives your viewers a consistent idea of what they can expect any time new video releases onto your YouTube channel.</p><h2 id="4-Use-Analytics-to-Improve"><a href="#4-Use-Analytics-to-Improve" class="headerlink" title="4. Use Analytics to Improve"></a>4. Use Analytics to Improve</h2><p>Some marketers could have an unhealthy relationship with analytics. They track too many of the numbers. Maybe we think we can prove any marketing campaign is producing results if there’s an eye-catching percentage. But we all know that some metrics are a lot more revealing than other types of statistics.</p><p>We have listed 3 important types of metrics you have to study to truly understand your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934288/19272" target="_top" id="1934288">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934288" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934288/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="❶-Watch-Time"><a href="#❶-Watch-Time" class="headerlink" title="❶ Watch Time"></a>❶ Watch Time</h3><p>The Watch Time is the total amount of minutes viewers have spent watching your content. It’s a key metric because YouTube pushes videos and channels with higher Watch Times in their search results and recommendations section. YouTube does this because the more Watch Time a video has, the more engaging their algorithm knows it is and YouTube like to recommend videos that keep viewers as long as possible on the platform.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-05.jpg"                      alt="Watch Time"                ></p><p>Watch Time</p><p>In the Watch Time section, you can see the amount of Watch Time your videos have generated.

This metric measures your video’s ability to engage people. If your video can’t engage new visitors, they’ll jump off from your video quite fast, leaving you with an unimpressive average view duration. If you create a high-performing video, your Average view duration and total Watch Time will increase over time and boost your search and recommendations rankings by a lot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-06.jpg"                      alt="Average view duration"                ></p><p>Average View Duration</p><h3 id="❸-Audience-Retention"><a href="#❸-Audience-Retention" class="headerlink" title="❸ Audience Retention"></a>❸ Audience Retention</h3><p>Let’s talk about Audience Retention. If your video is longer than five minutes, and Audience Retention is more than 50%, you are going in the right direction. A hook is something that grabs a viewer’s attention and will result in them staying longer on your video or browsing your other content. We recommend regularly reviewing your videos to ensure you aren’t attracting visitors to outdated content. Older videos can turn them away and they may view your YouTube channel as less trustworthy or valuable as a source for the information that they are looking for. Updated videos are high-quality videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-07.jpg"                      alt="Audience Retention"                ></p><p>Audience Retention</p><h2 id="5-Promotion-and-Marketing"><a href="#5-Promotion-and-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="5.

Understand ‘Success’ Means"></a>1. Understand ‘Success’ Means</h2><p>YouTube’s success is based on the premise that all visitors need the same thing. Search, find, and leave as fast as possible. Kind of like a store. But YouTube visitors have much more diverse needs than you might think. Some come to watch short clips of cats doing silly things, others to view TV shows or how to learn an instrument, cooking, maintain a car, and so much more.</p><p>The way your success is measured is by the number of viewers you get onto your channel. No matter what kind of content you upload, whether it’s about music, education, when you turn viewers into subscribers, dedicated fans, and supporters, that is how you can measure your success and how you can get as many new people through the door and make them stick around because they love what you do and what value you are to them. We are going more in-depth in the other stages of this article about analytics and measurements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-02.jpg"                      alt="Understanding What &#39;Success&#39; Means"                ></p><p>Understand What ‘Success’ Means</p><h2 id="2-Create-Your-Plan-1"><a href="#2-Create-Your-Plan-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Your Plan"></a>2. Create Your Plan</h2><p>When it comes to building a successful YouTube channel, consistency is super important. You are more likely to gain success if you have a well-thought-out plan and a strategy for uploading content. Instead of uploading once per month, try once per week if your time schedule allows it so your new viewers know when to expect a new video. Planning is super important because it will allow you to stick to a schedule. If you have a lot of time to create videos, people tend to get used to that schedule. Once you’re planning becomes less structured because of lack of time, it can confuse viewers as consistency is important. People do not like change, or it will take time for them to get used to a new schedule, especially if it changes often.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-03.jpg"                      alt="Creating Your Plan"                ></p><p>Create Your Plan</p><h2 id="3-Make-Your-YouTube-Videos-1"><a href="#3-Make-Your-YouTube-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Make Your YouTube Videos"></a>3. Make Your YouTube Videos</h2><p>After you created your plan, your strategy, and all the preparation, it is time to start filming! We highly recommend working with an upload schedule, so you know which videos to create and when they have to be finished. Try to have a good overall layout and theme for your videos from the start so people know who you are and what you do. Once you started filming you can continue the process and keep producing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                      alt="Filmora Note"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have less time, you can create more videos in one filming session so you have a bulk library you can release over the period when you don’t have time for creating content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-04.jpg"                      alt="Making Your YouTube Videos"                ></p><p>Make Your YouTube Videos</p><p>It’s highly recommended to write down a list of topics for videos so you can have your same recording set ready to go for whenever you start shooting. If you are able to keep a dedicated space to keep your set, that’s a huge plus instead of having to tear everything down and setting up again each time you film and it gives your viewers a consistent idea of what they can expect any time new video releases onto your YouTube channel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Use-Analytics-to-Improve-1"><a href="#4-Use-Analytics-to-Improve-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Use Analytics to Improve"></a>4. Use Analytics to Improve</h2><p>Some marketers could have an unhealthy relationship with analytics. They track too many of the numbers. Maybe we think we can prove any marketing campaign is producing results if there’s an eye-catching percentage. But we all know that some metrics are a lot more revealing than other types of statistics.</p><p>We have listed 3 important types of metrics you have to study to truly understand your audience.</p><h3 id="❶-Watch-Time-1"><a href="#❶-Watch-Time-1" class="headerlink" title="❶ Watch Time"></a>❶ Watch Time</h3><p>The Watch Time is the total amount of minutes viewers have spent watching your content. It’s a key metric because YouTube pushes videos and channels with higher Watch Times in their search results and recommendations section. YouTube does this because the more Watch Time a video has, the more engaging their algorithm knows it is and YouTube like to recommend videos that keep viewers as long as possible on the platform.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-05.jpg"                      alt="Watch Time"                ></p><p>Watch Time</p><p>In the Watch Time section, you can see the amount of Watch Time your videos have generated. You can also rank each of your videos by Watch Time and group your videos by styles, lengths and themes to determine your most engaging videos.</p><h3 id="❷-Average-view-duration-1"><a href="#❷-Average-view-duration-1" class="headerlink" title="❷ Average view duration"></a>❷ Average view duration</h3><p>Your Average view duration is the total Watch Time of your video divided by the total number of video playbacks, also including replays. This metric measures your video’s ability to engage people. If your video can’t engage new visitors, they’ll jump off from your video quite fast, leaving you with an unimpressive average view duration. If you create a high-performing video, your Average view duration and total Watch Time will increase over time and boost your search and recommendations rankings by a lot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-06.jpg"                      alt="Average view duration"                ></p><p>Average View Duration</p><h3 id="❸-Audience-Retention-1"><a href="#❸-Audience-Retention-1" class="headerlink" title="❸ Audience Retention"></a>❸ Audience Retention</h3><p>Let’s talk about Audience Retention. If your video is longer than five minutes, and Audience Retention is more than 50%, you are going in the right direction. A hook is something that grabs a viewer’s attention and will result in them staying longer on your video or browsing your other content. We recommend regularly reviewing your videos to ensure you aren’t attracting visitors to outdated content. Older videos can turn them away and they may view your YouTube channel as less trustworthy or valuable as a source for the information that they are looking for. Updated videos are high-quality videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-07.jpg"                      alt="Audience Retention"                ></p><p>Audience Retention</p><h2 id="5-Promotion-and-Marketing-1"><a href="#5-Promotion-and-Marketing-1" class="headerlink" title="5.

In After Effects, this tool adds an invisible layer that is used to mask or reveal parts of a layer, including video, graphics, text, shapes, and images. This feature is in the arsenal of any visual effects artist or motion graphic designer.</p><p>For After Effects editors, <strong>Track Mattes</strong> can be an incredibly helpful tool for managing multiple layers and creating complex animations.</p><p>In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about <strong>Track Mattes</strong>.

Essentially, it lets you create a “hole” in a layer so that underlying layers can show through. This tool can be used with video and audio layers, which is essential for creating complex composites in After Effects.</p><p>You can use Track Mattes to generate shapes, reveal part of a layer, or keying outs. Interestingly, it remains independent of all layers in your projects, which means you can get visual effects and animations more efficiently than with the masks tool.</p><p>Moreover, Track Mattes uses Alpha or Luma channels as a layer mask to determine what parts of the layer to reveal. For instance, you can make a top layer that provides an Alpha or Luminous effect and a bottom layer consisting of the image that will be revealed or shown.</p><p>Thus, if you want to use an image to hide your video until you want to unveil it or add a picture in your text, Track Mattes will help you to shape the appearance of a layer above it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Between-A-Mask-And-A-Track-Matte"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Between-A-Mask-And-A-Track-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects</h2><p>After Effects provides four types of Track Matte options: Alpha Matte, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte, each has its own specific use case. But first, you need to understand what Alpha and Luma are:</p><p><strong>Alpha:</strong> This Track Matte type uses the layer’s Alpha channel to determine the layer’s opacity.</p><p><strong>Luma:</strong> This Track Matte type uses the top layer’s brightness to mask the bottom layer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-four-track-matte-options-in-after-effects.png"                      alt="the four track matte options in after effects"                ></p><p>Let’s find out the functions of each option one by one:</p><h3 id="Alpha-Matte"><a href="#Alpha-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Alpha Matte"></a>Alpha Matte</h3><p>Alpha Matte is an important option under the Track Matte menu, as it allows you to create a mask based on the transparency of the layer you are using it on. Like the mask, it will use any pixel above 0% opacity and can be useful for various purposes, such as creating a vignette or isolating a certain area of the frame.</p><h3 id="Alpha-Inverted-Matte"><a href="#Alpha-Inverted-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Alpha Inverted Matte"></a>Alpha Inverted Matte</h3><p>The Alpha Inverted Matte option is quite the opposite of the Alpha Matte, and around the Alpha channel, it uses negative space from the above layer and will therefore use pixels with 0% opacity as it had 100% opacity.</p><h3 id="Luma-Matte"><a href="#Luma-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Luma Matte"></a>Luma Matte</h3><p>Instead of using the Alpha channel, Luma Mattes uses the brightness level or Luma channel of the upper layer to create a mask for the bottom layer.</p><h3 id="Luma-Inverted-Matte"><a href="#Luma-Inverted-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Luma Inverted Matte"></a>Luma Inverted Matte</h3><p>Opposite of the Luma Matte, the Luma Inverted Matte uses dark or low luminance areas of the upper layer to create a mask for the lower layer.</p><h3 id="Differences-Between-Alpha-Channel-and-Luma-Channel"><a href="#Differences-Between-Alpha-Channel-and-Luma-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel"></a>Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel</h3><p>When altering the opacity of a layer, it may look like the brightness settings are changed. This might confuse some users, as both Alpha and Luma channels carry the same information. However, they differ in how they are used.</p><p>Alpha channel is a type of Track Matte that stores transparency information. This information determines how opaque or transparent a layer will be when superimposed over another layer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/alpha-channel-in-track-matte.png"                      alt="alpha channel in track matte"                ></p><p>On the other hand, a Luma channel is a video track that stores brightness information. This information is used to determine how bright or dark an image will be and is further divided into three channels, i.e., Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). Their value ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 represents the darkest value while 255 represents the brightest value.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/luma-channel-in-track-matte.png"                      alt="luma channel in track matte"                ></p><p><strong>Video – How to use Track Mattes in Adobe After Effects - Tutorial</strong></p><h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve discussed what Track Matte is in After Effects and how it differs from the mask tool. We also explored where to find the Track Matter option and its four options, i.e., Alpha Matte, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte.

For instance, you can make a top layer that provides an Alpha or Luminous effect and a bottom layer consisting of the image that will be revealed or shown.</p><p>Thus, if you want to use an image to hide your video until you want to unveil it or add a picture in your text, Track Mattes will help you to shape the appearance of a layer above it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Between-A-Mask-And-A-Track-Matte-1"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Between-A-Mask-And-A-Track-Matte-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte"></a>Part 2. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte</h2><p>In Adobe After Effects, there are two types of masking tools: Masks and Track Mattes. Both are used to hide or reveal a portion of a layer.</p><p>Here’re some key differences between a Mask and a Track Matte:</p><ol><li>A mask is dependent on a specific layer, while the Track Matter is independent of any layer.</li><li>A mask is applied directly to a layer having an image or a video and transforms with the layers. On the other hand, Track Matte is a stationary mask applied to the composition rather than a layer.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-3-Finding-The-Track-Matte-Tool-In-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Part-3-Finding-The-Track-Matte-Tool-In-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Finding The Track Matte Tool In After Effects</h2><p>Track Matte is located by default in the Timeline Window of the After Effects interface, but if it is unavailable there for some reason, toggle the <strong>Transfer Control Pane</strong> button on the bottom-left of the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/track-matter-in-the-timeline-window-of-the-after-effects.png"                      alt="track matte in the timeline window of the after effects"                ></p><p>If you are still unable to find the Track Matte option, press the <strong>F1 key</strong> or do the following steps in sequence:</p><ol><li>Right-click on the area above your layers and select <strong>“Columns.”</strong></li><li>Scroll down and click the <strong>“Modes”</strong> option to enable it.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/finding-the-track-matte-option-in-after-effects.png"                      alt="finding the track matte option in after effects"                ></p><ol><li><strong>Track Matte mode, Preserve Underlying Transparency,</strong> and <strong>Blending Modes</strong> will be available now.</li></ol><p>Under Track Matte’s drop-down menu, you can find four further options, two with Alpha and two with Luma.

All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects"></a>Part 4. All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects</h2><p>After Effects provides four types of Track Matte options: Alpha Matte, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte, each has its own specific use case. But first, you need to understand what Alpha and Luma are:</p><p><strong>Alpha:</strong> This Track Matte type uses the layer’s Alpha channel to determine the layer’s opacity.</p><p><strong>Luma:</strong> This Track Matte type uses the top layer’s brightness to mask the bottom layer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-four-track-matte-options-in-after-effects.png"                      alt="the four track matte options in after effects"                ></p><p>Let’s find out the functions of each option one by one:</p><h3 id="Alpha-Matte-1"><a href="#Alpha-Matte-1" class="headerlink" title="Alpha Matte"></a>Alpha Matte</h3><p>Alpha Matte is an important option under the Track Matte menu, as it allows you to create a mask based on the transparency of the layer you are using it on. Like the mask, it will use any pixel above 0% opacity and can be useful for various purposes, such as creating a vignette or isolating a certain area of the frame.</p><h3 id="Alpha-Inverted-Matte-1"><a href="#Alpha-Inverted-Matte-1" class="headerlink" title="Alpha Inverted Matte"></a>Alpha Inverted Matte</h3><p>The Alpha Inverted Matte option is quite the opposite of the Alpha Matte, and around the Alpha channel, it uses negative space from the above layer and will therefore use pixels with 0% opacity as it had 100% opacity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148648/16836" target="_top" id="2148648">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148648" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148648/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Luma-Matte-1"><a href="#Luma-Matte-1" class="headerlink" title="Luma Matte"></a>Luma Matte</h3><p>Instead of using the Alpha channel, Luma Mattes uses the brightness level or Luma channel of the upper layer to create a mask for the bottom layer.</p><h3 id="Luma-Inverted-Matte-1"><a href="#Luma-Inverted-Matte-1" class="headerlink" title="Luma Inverted Matte"></a>Luma Inverted Matte</h3><p>Opposite of the Luma Matte, the Luma Inverted Matte uses dark or low luminance areas of the upper layer to create a mask for the lower layer.</p><h3 id="Differences-Between-Alpha-Channel-and-Luma-Channel-1"><a href="#Differences-Between-Alpha-Channel-and-Luma-Channel-1" class="headerlink" title="Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel"></a>Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel</h3><p>When altering the opacity of a layer, it may look like the brightness settings are changed. This might confuse some users, as both Alpha and Luma channels carry the same information. However, they differ in how they are used.</p><p>Alpha channel is a type of Track Matte that stores transparency information. This information determines how opaque or transparent a layer will be when superimposed over another layer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/alpha-channel-in-track-matte.png"                      alt="alpha channel in track matte"                ></p><p>On the other hand, a Luma channel is a video track that stores brightness information. This information is used to determine how bright or dark an image will be and is further divided into three channels, i.e., Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). Their value ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 represents the darkest value while 255 represents the brightest value.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/luma-channel-in-track-matte.png"                      alt="luma channel in track matte"                ></p><p><strong>Video – How to use Track Mattes in Adobe After Effects - Tutorial</strong></p><h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve discussed what Track Matte is in After Effects and how it differs from the mask tool. We also explored where to find the Track Matter option and its four options, i.e., Alpha Matte, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte. In the end, we discussed the difference between the Alpha and Luma channels to provide a clear view of the two.</p><p>Hopefully, this guide resolves your queries, and you now have a better understanding of the Track Matte tool in After Effects.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-harnessing-powerful-tools-for-effective-youtubers-seo-for-2024/"><u>[New] Harnessing Powerful Tools for Effective YouTubers' SEO for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-second-screen-craftsman/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Second-Screen Craftsman</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/2024-approved-consider-a-lut-to-be-a-color-preset-that-a-filmmaker-can-use-to-start-working-on-a-project-quickly-sony-engineers-have-developed-luts-to-help-/"><u>2024 Approved Consider a LUT to Be a Color Preset that a Filmmaker Can Use to Start Working on a Project Quickly.

One of these features is the 3D <strong>Camera Tracking,</strong> which allows you to take your motion graphic effects to the next level.</p><p><strong>Camera Tracking</strong> is extracting the camera movement from a recorded video sequence. This process allows filmmakers to add computer-generated elements to a live action shot, track objects throughout a shot for compositing, and estimate camera movements for virtual reality applications.</p><p>In this article, we will explore what Camera <strong>Tracking</strong> is and Motion Tracking in After Effect. We’ll also show you how to use 3D Camera Tracking in After Effects on a Windows PC.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Camera-Tracking"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Camera-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Camera Tracking"></a>Part 1. What Is Camera Tracking</h2><p>Camera Tracking is a process that determines the movement of a video clip. This information can be used to add certain effects to the video, such as objects that seem to follow the camera or text that appears to be stationary in the frame.</p><p>Camera Tracking is a relatively simple process, but it can be time-consuming. However, the results are often worth the effort, as it can add a whole new level of realism to your footage clips.</p><p>For example, you have taken a video clip of a zoo and want to add an object to it while making sure it gives a realistic look. This is where the <strong>Camera Tracking</strong> feature can help you make a smooth transition and add the element as if it was there.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Use-Camera-Tracking"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Use-Camera-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Use Camera Tracking?"></a>Part 2. Why Use Camera Tracking?</h2><p>Now that you know what Camera Tracking is, let’s have a look at some benefits of using it:</p><ul><li>Add a 3D object or element to a 2D video clip.</li><li>Embed objects, texts, etc., to a video.</li><li>Stabilize a shaky camera&#x2F;video clip.</li><li>Create special effects.</li><li>Apply color grading.</li><li>Replace a TV or PC screen with some information.</li></ul><p>Thus, if you need some basic compositions or advanced ones, the Camera Tracking feature will help you track your videos, embed anything you want, or create special effects to make your clip different.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Motion-Tracking-In-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-3-Motion-Tracking-In-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Motion Tracking In After Effects"></a>Part 3. Motion Tracking In After Effects</h2><p>The Motion Tracking capability is Adobe After Effects’ feature that allows you to track the movement of the camera&#x2F;an object in a video clip and use the data to add effects to objects.</p><p>Motion tracking can be used for various effects, like creating realistic text animations or adding special effects to objects in a video.</p><p>There are four main types of Motion Tracking in After Effects, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:</p><h3 id="Single-Point-Tracking"><a href="#Single-Point-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Single Point Tracking"></a>Single Point Tracking</h3><p>Single Point tracking tracks a single position in a video clip. You can use it for composing a video clip with a single point of focus, and it is suitable for following the movement of an object with right-left or up-down motion.</p><p><strong>Advantage:</strong> Single Point Tracking is perfect for tracking a single position or motion of a single object.</p><p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> No scale or rotation properties and needs a clear contrast point for effective results.</p><h3 id="Two-Point-Tracking"><a href="#Two-Point-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Two Point Tracking"></a>Two Point Tracking</h3><p>Two Point Tracking is a feature that allows you to track two points in a footage clip and can be used for scale, motion, and rotation tracking.</p><p><strong>Advantage:</strong> Two Point Tracking can track scale and rotation along with the motion.</p><p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> It doesn’t give effective results with a shaky video clip.</p><h3 id="Four-Point-Tracking"><a href="#Four-Point-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Four Point Tracking"></a>Four Point Tracking</h3><p>The Four Point Tracking feature lets you track four different points (corners) in your footage and apply the tracking data to a layer in your composition.</p><p>The four points can be placed at the screen’s corners in your shot, and new footage is applied to cover the screen.</p><p><strong>Advantage:</strong> Directly pins the data to each corner of the image.</p><p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Cannot be used to create a 3D object.</p><h3 id="3D-Camera-Tracking"><a href="#3D-Camera-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="3D Camera Tracking"></a>3D Camera Tracking</h3><p>With 3D camera tracking, you can track the movement of a camera in a video and place 3D elements in the scene that match the camera’s movement. This is a great way to add realism to your graphics and make them look like they’re part of the scene.</p><p><strong>Advantage:</strong> 3D Camera Tracking can help you add shapes, texts, or 3D objects to 2D footage.</p><p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> A bit tricky and needs an expert grip on the tool to use effectively.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Use-3D-Camera-Tracking-In-After-Effects-Of-Windows"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Use-3D-Camera-Tracking-In-After-Effects-Of-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Before you start, make sure you put the camera on a tripod or a steady surface, so it doesn’t move while filming.</p><p>Step1 For the first shot, you must throw a jacket on a stool. Make sure it lands on the stool or wherever your talent is going to sit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_1.jpg"                      alt="throw a jacket on a stool"                ></p><p>Step2 Make a shot of your talent appearing from where the jacket landed. You can add some acting skills to make this shot more realistic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_2.jpg"                      alt="make a shot of your talent appearing"                ></p><p>Step3 Download Filmora to edit your footage. You can get started by going to their official website.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_3.jpg"                      alt="download filmora"                ></p><p>Step4 Now split the first clip on the frame where your jacket lands on the stool. Place it on the first track.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_4.jpg"                      alt="split the first clip on the frame"                ></p><p>Step5 Trim the second shot until the talents start acting and place it on the second track to match the first clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_5.jpg"                      alt="trim the second shot"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-an-Explosion-Appearance"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-an-Explosion-Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make an Explosion Appearance"></a>Part 3: How to Make an Explosion Appearance</h2><p>Step1 This effect is the easiest. You need to film the empty plate with just a background. Then let the talent enter the frame and jump into the place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_6.jpg"                      alt="let the talent enter the frame"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918684/19272" target="_top" id="1918684">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918684" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918684/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step2 Now import the clip into Filmora and place it onto the first video track.</p><p>Step3 Freeze the frame of the empty plate with just the background and extend it as necessary.

However, it is a simple concept for video editors where the encoding settings determine the frequency at which the whole picture is transmitted.</p><p>The <strong>Keyframe Interval</strong> is responsible for how often a keyframe is generated within the video. A keyframe, also known as an i-frame, is a single frame that contains all of the necessary information for displaying a video. If the Keyframe Interval is set too high, it could lead to visible compression without compromising the quality of a video.</p><p><strong>Keyframe Interval</strong> is essential in video streaming and recording, but it can be confusing. In this guide, we’ll help you understand this concept to enable you to create better animations.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Keyframe-Interval"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Keyframe-Interval" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Keyframe Interval"></a>Part 1. What Is Keyframe Interval</h2><p>Keyframe Intervals, also known as “Keyframe Frequency” in Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder (FMLE) and vMix or “GOP size” by some encoders, is the frequency at which keyframes are generated in an animated sequence. This is an important parameter to consider when creating animations, as it can impact the animation’s file size, quality, and smoothness.</p><p>Keyframe Intervals are the distance in time between two keyframes. For example, if an animation is set to every 2 seconds interval and the frame rate is 30 per second, it means that every 60 frames, a keyframe is created.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/keyframe-interval-in-a-video.png"                      alt="keyframe interval in a video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1328679">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1328679">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1328679%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1328679/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Keyframe-Interval-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Keyframe-Interval-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Does Keyframe Interval Work?"></a>Part 2. How Does Keyframe Interval Work?</h2><p>Keyframes are important in video and animation because they mark specific points in time that can be used to create a smooth and consistent transition between different states or images. The Keyframe Interval is the amount of time that passes between two keyframes.</p><p>In order to create a smooth and consistent transition, the Keyframe Interval must be carefully calculated. In a 60-frame-per-second video, a keyframe is recorded every 5 or 300 frames. Delta frames are “difference” frames that provide an incremental change from the previous frame.</p><p>Keyframes are different from delta frames in that a higher keyframe value results in a clearer video with fewer transmission artifacts and vice versa.</p><p>The Keyframe Interval can be adjusted to create a faster or slower transition between two keyframes. A shorter Keyframe Interval will create a faster transition, while a longer one will create a slower transition.</p><p>For example, if you want your transition to look smoother, use a longer interval, like two seconds. Conversely, a zoom effect over a 0.2-second interval will be quicker.</p><h2 id="Part-3-A-concept-closely-connected-to-Keyframe-Interval-Bitrates"><a href="#Part-3-A-concept-closely-connected-to-Keyframe-Interval-Bitrates" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. A concept closely connected to Keyframe Interval - Bitrates"></a>Part 3. A concept closely connected to Keyframe Interval - Bitrates</h2><p>The relationship between keyframes and bitrates is important to understand when creating video content. Keyframes are the frames in a video that are used to define the start and end points of an encoding process. The bitrate measures how much information is being transferred in a given time from one place to another.</p><p>When encoding video, keyframes are used to establish a consistent quality throughout the video. The bitrate is then used to determine how much information can be transferred without affecting the quality of the video. Thus, the higher the video’s bitrate, the better the quality.</p><p>Your mileage may vary regarding this explanation, as different encoders manage bitrates and keyframes in different ways.</p><p>For example, if you’re using an encoder like Wirecast, you might notice that broadcasting in a still background with someone talking results in a higher quality video as compared to a moving background. This can be reproduced using the same average bitrate and Keyframe Interval between them.</p><p>This happens because the delta frames have to share a lot more information to share in each frame in the video with a moving background. When you have an encoder like Wirecast, it’s working to keep your stream at an average bitrate. This can result in reduced quality if there is a lot of extra information in the <a class="link"   href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/delta-frame#:~:text=In%20interframe%20video%20coding%2C%20a,%2Dframes%20or%20B%2Dframes." >delta frames. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-4-What-You-Need-To-Know-To-Set-A-Right-Keyframe-Interval"><a href="#Part-4-What-You-Need-To-Know-To-Set-A-Right-Keyframe-Interval" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

What You Need To Know To Set A Right Keyframe Interval</h2><p>After understanding the important concepts in video editing, let’s see how to set the keyframe level in our videos appropriately.</p><p>Most streaming services will automatically set it for you based on your stream’s frame rate and bitrate.

Will Keyframe Interval Affect Your Video’s Quality?"></a>Part 6. Will Keyframe Interval Affect Your Video’s Quality?</h2><p>When you try to set the keyframe gap by yourself, you may feel confused about the difference a higher or lower interval make to your video. Then, wil-l or how it affects your video’s performance?</p><p>In a stream, it determines the balance between smoothness and picture quality. A keyframe is a point that determines how often the entire frame is sent, as opposed to just the differences from the previous frame.</p><p>Therefore, if you set the Keyframe Interval higher, your video will be more stable with fewer artifacts but requires more bandwidth and processing power. Conversely, a lower Keyframe Interval value causes more artifacts but is less resource intensive.</p><p>A lower Keyframe Interval value will result in lower video quality, while a higher keyframe value will result in higher video quality. However, the optimal Keyframe Interval value can vary depending on the specific case.</p><p>For instance, you don’t need a higher Keyframe Interval for streaming a live video, but you have to use a higher Key Interval value for recording.</p><p>Video- What is the Maximum Bitrate &amp; Keyframe Interval for OBS</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>In this article, we’ve explored Keyframe Interval, how it works, and the relationship between keyframes and bitrates.

Many properties are involved in setting up the motion blur effect on an object. It includes defining the position, shutter, separation, and several other parameters. In this part, we will be looking for a guide on <strong>how to add motion blur in Blender</strong>:</p><p>Step1 With the video opened on Blender, proceed to the “Render Properties.” Look to enable “Motion Blur” from the available options. Click on the arrowhead adjacent to it to access its advanced blur options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-2.jpg"                      alt="enable the motion blur option"                ></p><p>Step2 Start by setting its “Position” in the start, center, or end, according to the requirements. For those who are not sure of it, they can use “Center on Frame.” If the objects rapidly move in the video, reduce the “Shutter” value or vice versa.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-3.jpg"                      alt="adjust the shutter value"                ></p><p>Step3 Following this, define the “Background Separation” according to how you require the foreground and background. Next, you will have to increase or decrease the “Max Blur” pixels to define the blur intensity in the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-4.jpg"                      alt="set background separation and max blur"                ></p><p>Step4 For objects with complex topology, you might have to increase the “Steps,” hence the “Shutter” time. For simple objects, the value remains unity. To apply the motion blur effect, use the F12 key for rendering the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-5.jpg"                      alt="set the value for steps"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-–-Add-Motion-Blur-to-Animated-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-–-Add-Motion-Blur-to-Animated-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips – Add Motion Blur to Animated Video with Filmora"></a>Bonus Tips – Add Motion Blur to Animated Video with Filmora</h2><p>Blender can become challenging to use, a no-go for basic video editors.

Look No Further than Our Top Pick for the Best Cloud Storage Service for Videos</h2><p>Which <strong>video cloud storage</strong> service is the best for storing videos? Many options are available, so it can be hard to decide which is the best for you.</p><p>Some factors to consider when choosing a cloud storage service for videos include how easy it is to use, the number of storage options available, and the price.</p><p>Some popular <strong>best video cloud storage</strong> services for videos include Flicker, Wondershare Drive, and Adobe Creative Cloud. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it’s essential to consider what you need before making a decision.</p><p>Ultimately, the best cloud storage service for videos is one that meets your specific needs. So don’t hesitate to try out different services to see which one is best for you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-No-1-Flicker"><a href="#Part-1-No-1-Flicker" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: No.1 Flicker"></a>Part 1: No.1 Flicker</h2><p>Flickr is an online image hosting and video hosting service that has been around for a long time. However, SmugMug now owns it, and you can access photos and videos from Flickr without registering an account.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068426/7443" target="_top" id="2068426">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068426" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068426/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Flicker-Free-Storage-Policy"><a href="#Flicker-Free-Storage-Policy" class="headerlink" title="Flicker Free Storage Policy"></a>Flicker Free Storage Policy</h3><p>Flickr is a great <strong>online video storage</strong> service, but it can be limiting if you want to store many pictures and videos. For example, a Flickr free account can only store 1000 photos and videos, which means it can only hold about 2-3 GB of data.</p><p>Flickr also has some limitations when it comes to file size. For example, photos are limited to 200 MB and videos are limited to 1 GB. However, you can get around these limitations by storing the maximum allowed file size (e.g., photo files are limited to 200 MB and video files are limited to 1 GB). Additionally, if you want to share photos and videos with others, you’ll need to <strong>upload video to the cloud</strong> or use the Flickr app on a device.</p><p>Overall, Flickr is a great online photo and video storage service, but it may not be the best option for you if you’re looking for a lot of space or want to share photos and videos with others.</p><h3 id="Flicker-Pro-Storage-Policy"><a href="#Flicker-Pro-Storage-Policy" class="headerlink" title="Flicker Pro Storage Policy"></a>Flicker Pro Storage Policy</h3><p>Flicker Cloud Storage is a paid storage service that offers users unlimited storage space and a range of features to help them manage their photos and videos.</p><p>The paid policy of Flicker Cloud Storage allows users to store unlimited data for a monthly fee of $5.99.

Perhaps a professional setting might be too much for a particular video chat, whilst a humorous backdrop wouldn’t work. In this situation, a blurred picture backdrop will be the difference between putting little to no effort into your call and being ready to portray yourself in the best possible way.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="TikTok-Velocity-Dance-Tutorial-Filmora"><a href="#TikTok-Velocity-Dance-Tutorial-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="TikTok Velocity Dance Tutorial| Filmora"></a>TikTok Velocity Dance Tutorial| Filmora</h2><p>Preparation</p><p><strong>What you need to prepare:</strong></p><ul><li>A computer (Windows or macOS)</li><li>Your video materials.</li><li>Filmora video editor</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Step 1</p><p>First, download the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

There are currently more than 2.5 billion gamers, and most of them love watching gaming video content on YouTube. Whether people use a montage to parody gaming montages themselves or show off their skills, the effort and time put into them create impressive results.</p><p>We will explain how to create gaming montages and give you some tips that you might want to keep in mind to make epic videos.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Gaming-Montage"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Gaming-Montage" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Gaming Montage"></a>How to Make a Gaming Montage</h2><p>You have several options when it comes to creating gaming montages. You can include a random cut of great scenes, a mixture of the highlighted moments you found thrilling and would like to share with other gamers. In other cases, you’ll have to think of an engaging story in advance, then base your gameplay on this story.</p><p>Essentially, the workflow will be slightly different for these two scenarios. It’s much easier with the random cut type, especially when using a reliable video editor. Editing montages is as exciting as playing the game.</p><p>With that in mind, here is how to make a gaming montage.</p><h3 id="1-Decide-Your-Montage-Story-Type"><a href="#1-Decide-Your-Montage-Story-Type" class="headerlink" title="1) Decide Your Montage Story&#x2F;Type"></a>1) Decide Your Montage Story&#x2F;Type</h3><p>Deciding your montage type beforehand helps clear your mind and create an epic gaming montage that will keep viewers watching. It allows you to choose the relevant video clips for your gaming montage.</p><p>Choose the topic of the video and decide the length of each clip and the sequence of the clips. Be sure to put the most epic or funny clips in the last section of your video. And this will make your viewers watch the video until the end.</p><h3 id="2-Record-Your-Gameplay-Footage"><a href="#2-Record-Your-Gameplay-Footage" class="headerlink" title="2) Record Your Gameplay Footage"></a>2) Record Your Gameplay Footage</h3><p>The methods to capture the gameplay varies depending on the platform where the game is. The most important thing you have to keep in mind is to ensure your recorder supports Replay Buffer; this will allow you to record scenes that occurred minutes or seconds ago.</p><p>That means you do not need to record the gameplay the whole time and burn your hardware. Instead, you’ll capture the moment after interesting things occur.</p><p>Game consoles like PS4 allow you to record the video natively for a maximum of one hour with the gamepad.

He did the project with Apel, an artist who designed the Fever Dream series skins in the video.</p><p>The basic idea of this gaming montage was that the main game character is a corrupted policeman with purple glowing eyes because he’s not human.</p><p>When the edits begin, the shape of the main character will shift from CS: GO CT models and turn into his real corrupt CT shape. So that’s why his name keeps changing. You can get his real identity by pausing some of the frames and looking at the “Killfeed.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gaming-montage-6.png"                      alt="Best Gaming Montage Example - NEVERMORE"                ></p><p>NEVERMORE [CS: GO]</p><p>Closing Thoughts:</p><p>Gaming montage involves picking and editing a range of video clips, which are brought together to create engaging video content.

It has many of the features of Adobe Premiere, but it is free.</p><p>It supports the following formats: AVI, MP4, WMV, MKV, MOV, FLV and 3GP.</p><p>Wondershare Filmora is different than most video editors in that it does not use timelines. Instead, the user edits clips in a storyboard and adds effects and titles to them. It also has an Audio Visualization feature that plays back music in your collection and shows what you’re listening to in real time. There is no voice-over tool and it is not possible to add an audio track.</p><p>Wondershare Filmora has a very large number of effects, all editable via keyframes. These include simple motion graphics such as fades and dissolves, but it also includes advanced options like motion blur and chroma-key. There are free downloadable effects, which are created by users.</p><p>Wondershare Filmora supports text editing and there is a large library of free fonts available for download on its website. It does not support green-screening&#x2F;chroma-keying. This can be done in post production via Adobe Premiere or other software.</p><p>It also has the ability to add a number of different titles, which can be stacked and moved around in 3D space.</p><p>Wondershare Filmora allows you to import photos for use in slideshows and effects. Every clip or image can have its own effect applied to it if desired.</p><p>After editing, the project is rendered in real time with no waiting. You can also choose to render only part of the video by selecting the time range.</p><p>One final bonus is Wondershare Filmora’s media library, which allows users to add files from their computer and sort them by category. This makes finding your desired video a much easier task.</p><p>This software has a very simple interface that is easy to navigate, even for beginners. The design of the program makes it intuitive enough that you can start editing videos right away without having to go through tutorials. It is easy to create the desired effects and titles that you need for your video with just a few clicks. Its editing tools are powerful enough for professional use while still being easy to learn.</p><p>The one downside is that Wondershare Filmora does not support 4K resolution—the maximum output size is 1080p.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h2 id="Step-by-step-on-how-to-crop-videos-using-Filmora"><a href="#Step-by-step-on-how-to-crop-videos-using-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step-by-step on how to crop videos using Filmora?"></a><strong>Step-by-step on how to crop videos using Filmora?</strong></h2><p>To crop your short video (a clip) and also resize it, follow the steps given below:</p><p>Step 1: Open Filmora video editor.

Raytracing lets you have proper reflections, internal refraction, and transparency.</p><p>In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore the basics of Ray Tracing and everything you need to know about 3D <strong>Ray Traced</strong> in After Effects.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">History</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Advantages</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Disadvantages</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How Does Ray Tracing Work</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Ray Tracing In Adobe After Effects</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part4-1">Functions</a>  </li><li><a href="#part4-2">How Does It Work</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part5">Ray-Traced 3D Settings In Adobe After Effects</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part5-1">How To Set It</a>  </li><li><a href="#part5-2">When To Use It</a>  </li><li><a href="#part5-3">Ray Traced 3D After Effects Plugin Download</a></li></ol><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Ray-Tracing"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Ray-Tracing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?"></a>Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?</h2><p>Ray Tracing is a powerful rendering technique that can create incredibly realistic lighting and shadows. By tracing the path of light, algorithms can simulate the way that light interacts with virtual objects in a computer-generated world.</p><p>This results in more lifelike shadows, reflections, and translucence. Ray Tracing has been responsible for the dramatic increase in realism we’ve seen in video games over the years, and its benefits are only becoming more apparent as technology improves.</p><p>In simple words, Ray Tracing is a computer graphics technique for generating realistic images and works by tracing the light’s path from the camera through the scene. This allows for accurate simulations of light interactions, such as reflection, refraction, and shadows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ray-tracing-technology.png"                      alt="ray tracing technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Overview-Of-Ray-Tracing"><a href="#Part-2-Overview-Of-Ray-Tracing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Overview Of Ray Tracing"></a>Part 2. Overview Of Ray Tracing</h2><p>In this part, we will explain what Ray Tracing is from the following sides and for your better understanding.</p><h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Albrecht Dürer first gave the idea of Ray Tracing in the 16th century through his invention, the Dürer’s door. However, it was not until 1968 that Arthur Appel used a computer for the first time to create a shaded picture through Ray Tracing.</p><p>First conceptualized in 1969, Ray Tracing is a common technique used to create computer-generated graphics for movies and TV shows today. This is because studios can use the processing power of multiple computers to get the job done quickly and efficiently. However, even with this extra processing power, Ray Tracing can be a long and difficult process.</p><p>Despite the challenges, Ray Tracing is becoming increasingly popular due to computer hardware and software advances. And as technology continues to improve, we can expect to see even more realistic images in the future.</p><h3 id="Advantages"><a href="#Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h3><p>Here’re some advantages of Ray Tracing:</p><ol><li><strong>Realistic Rendering:</strong> Ray Tracing can create more realistic images than those created with traditional rendering techniques. This is because it calculates the light path more accurately, resulting in more realistic shadows, refraction, and reflections.</li><li><strong>Anti-aliasing And Depth Of Field:</strong> Ray Tracing can help you quickly get the anti-aliasing and depth of field effects.</li></ol><h3 id="Disadvantages"><a href="#Disadvantages" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages"></a>Disadvantages</h3><p>The downside of Ray Tracing technology is that it requires a lot of computing power to run, and it can be difficult to create more complex lighting effects like <a class="link"   href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2017/ENU/3DSMax/files/GUID-174FC56F-A781-4D0A-98D7-790D436E98AE-htm.html#:~:text=Caustics%20are%20the%20effects%20of,or%20refraction%20through%20another%20object.&text=To%20calculate%20caustics%2C%20the%20mental,by%20the%20default%20scanline%20renderer.%29" >caustics. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148773/18498" target="_top" id="2148773">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148773" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148773/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-Does-Ray-Tracing-Work"><a href="#Part-3-How-Does-Ray-Tracing-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How Does Ray Tracing Work?"></a>Part 3. How Does Ray Tracing Work?</h2><p>Ray Tracking uses the process of denoising. The algorithm starts with the camera and traces the shades of shadows and lights.</p><p>Ray Tracing uses machine learning to fill in the gaps to form a realistic image. The brighter the scene, the higher the graphics quality; the higher the quality, the more expensive it is. This is why Ray Tracing didn’t become popular in the video game industry until recently.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Ray-Tracing-In-Adobe-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-4-Ray-Tracing-In-Adobe-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Ray Tracing In Adobe After Effects"></a>Part 4. Ray Tracing In Adobe After Effects</h2><p>After the introduction of Ray Tracing, we will combine it with a popular video editor - Adobe After Effects to see how it works. Adobe After Effects is a useful and powerful tool for creating visual effects and animated graphics. Adobe introduced Ray Tracing or <strong>Ray-Traced 3D</strong> feature in After Effect to help graphic designers create photorealistic 3D images and render light and shadow. This feature was added in 2012 with the release of After Effects CS 6.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ray-tracing-in-adobe-after-effects.png"                      alt="ray tracing in adobe after effects"                ></p><p>However, the Ray Tracing feature was later removed from After Effects in 2020 due to multiple reasons:</p><ul><li>The Ray Tracing tool always faced bugs and glitches.</li><li>This feature did not work correctly if you were not using Adobe Media Encoder.</li><li>NVIDIA would change the standards from time to time.</li></ul><h3 id="Functions"><a href="#Functions" class="headerlink" title="Functions"></a>Functions</h3><p>Though as mentioned above, the Ray Tracing feature was removed in 2020, its advanced 3D features are still worth of introducing.

What Is Ray Tracing?"></a>Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?</h2><p>Ray Tracing is a powerful rendering technique that can create incredibly realistic lighting and shadows. By tracing the path of light, algorithms can simulate the way that light interacts with virtual objects in a computer-generated world.</p><p>This results in more lifelike shadows, reflections, and translucence. Ray Tracing has been responsible for the dramatic increase in realism we’ve seen in video games over the years, and its benefits are only becoming more apparent as technology improves.</p><p>In simple words, Ray Tracing is a computer graphics technique for generating realistic images and works by tracing the light’s path from the camera through the scene. This allows for accurate simulations of light interactions, such as reflection, refraction, and shadows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ray-tracing-technology.png"                      alt="ray tracing technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Overview-Of-Ray-Tracing-1"><a href="#Part-2-Overview-Of-Ray-Tracing-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Overview Of Ray Tracing"></a>Part 2. Overview Of Ray Tracing</h2><p>In this part, we will explain what Ray Tracing is from the following sides and for your better understanding.</p><h3 id="History-1"><a href="#History-1" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Albrecht Dürer first gave the idea of Ray Tracing in the 16th century through his invention, the Dürer’s door. However, it was not until 1968 that Arthur Appel used a computer for the first time to create a shaded picture through Ray Tracing.</p><p>First conceptualized in 1969, Ray Tracing is a common technique used to create computer-generated graphics for movies and TV shows today. This is because studios can use the processing power of multiple computers to get the job done quickly and efficiently. However, even with this extra processing power, Ray Tracing can be a long and difficult process.</p><p>Despite the challenges, Ray Tracing is becoming increasingly popular due to computer hardware and software advances. And as technology continues to improve, we can expect to see even more realistic images in the future.</p><h3 id="Advantages-1"><a href="#Advantages-1" class="headerlink" title="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h3><p>Here’re some advantages of Ray Tracing:</p><ol><li><strong>Realistic Rendering:</strong> Ray Tracing can create more realistic images than those created with traditional rendering techniques. This is because it calculates the light path more accurately, resulting in more realistic shadows, refraction, and reflections.</li><li><strong>Anti-aliasing And Depth Of Field:</strong> Ray Tracing can help you quickly get the anti-aliasing and depth of field effects.</li></ol><h3 id="Disadvantages-1"><a href="#Disadvantages-1" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages"></a>Disadvantages</h3><p>The downside of Ray Tracing technology is that it requires a lot of computing power to run, and it can be difficult to create more complex lighting effects like <a class="link"   href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2017/ENU/3DSMax/files/GUID-174FC56F-A781-4D0A-98D7-790D436E98AE-htm.html#:~:text=Caustics%20are%20the%20effects%20of,or%20refraction%20through%20another%20object.&text=To%20calculate%20caustics%2C%20the%20mental,by%20the%20default%20scanline%20renderer.%29" >caustics. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Does-Ray-Tracing-Work-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-Does-Ray-Tracing-Work-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How Does Ray Tracing Work?"></a>Part 3. How Does Ray Tracing Work?</h2><p>Ray Tracking uses the process of denoising. The algorithm starts with the camera and traces the shades of shadows and lights.</p><p>Ray Tracing uses machine learning to fill in the gaps to form a realistic image. The brighter the scene, the higher the graphics quality; the higher the quality, the more expensive it is. This is why Ray Tracing didn’t become popular in the video game industry until recently.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Ray-Tracing-In-Adobe-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Part-4-Ray-Tracing-In-Adobe-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Create-the-Night-to-Day-Effect-Video"><a href="#How-to-Create-the-Night-to-Day-Effect-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Create the Night-to-Day Effect Video"></a>How to Create the Night-to-Day Effect Video</h2><p>Do you wish you could control when it’s nighttime to daytime? It would make getting ready in the morning much faster! This tutorial will show you how to use the keyframe and mask feature in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to make a remarkable night-to-day transition.</p><h2 id="How-to-Guide"><a href="#How-to-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How-to Guide"></a>How-to Guide</h2><p><strong><em>1) Preparation</em></strong></p><p>For this effect, you will need to shoot two footage shots with the same frame. The first is for the daytime clip, and the second is for nighttime.</p><p>But before that, you need to prepare some things, such as:</p><ol><li>Tripod to ensure your camera stays at the same point, so the frame doesn’t change.</li><li>Mark the place where you want to shoot the scene. You can put a marker on the floor to ensure that you perform at the same spot in different shots.</li></ol><p>Once done, let’s start shooting to get the footage.</p><p><strong><em>2) Steps</em></strong></p><p><strong>Shooting footages</strong></p><p>First, get the daytime shot. For this tutorial, we will pretend that you are walking and transitioning into nighttime at the spot you have marked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-1.gif"                      alt="get the daytime shot"                ></p><p>Now, let’s film the nighttime clip. You will walk through the living room and do the same movement again at the same spot. You can dim the light and change the camera’s white balance settings to bluer to create a night feeling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-2.gif"                      alt="film the nighttime clip"                ></p><p>After you have both clips that you need, let’s go to Filmora and start editing.</p><p><strong>Night-to-day transition</strong></p><p>Step1 Launch Filmora and import the footage into the program. If you haven’t installed it, you can download Filmora on their website here: <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/" >https://filmora.wondershare.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Step2 Place the nighttime video clip on the first video track of the timeline and place the daytime clip on the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-3.jpg"                      alt="place the daytime clip on the top"                ></p><p>Step3 Find the spot where you want to create a transition between the day and nighttime. Then, you can delete the unwanted part.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-4.jpg"                      alt="create a transition"                ></p><p>Step4 Since the transition for this tutorial is where the subject started waving, make sure to place the daytime clip at the same time the subject started waving in the nighttime clip. Hence, the timing in both clips syncs.</p><p><strong>Masking transition</strong></p><p>For the next step, we will make a masking transition with the Filmora mask feature.</p><p>Step1 Double-click the daytime clip on the timeline. In the Filmora setting, find the <strong>Mask section &gt; Circle</strong>. You can see the mask is applied in the preview screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-5.jpg"                      alt="double-click the daytime clip"                ></p><p>Step2 Scroll down the setting and click add a keyframe at the beginning of the clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-6.jpg"                      alt="scroll down the setting"                ></p><p>Step3 Change the scale of the mask to the smallest number and adjust the Width and Height down to 0. You can set the blur strength to 15 to make the transition edge smoother.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-7.jpg"                      alt="change the scale of the mask"                ></p><p>Step4 Move the play head to find the spot where you want the mask fully opens up, then add another keyframe. Change the scale of the mask to 2 and the Width and Height to 50. Make sure the mask occupies the whole frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-8.jpg"                      alt="add another keyframe"                ></p><p>Now, if you play back, you can see the nighttime becomes daytime through the mask.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-9.gif"                      alt="nighttime becomes daytime through the mask"                ></p><p>If the movement in the two clips is a bit off, you can fix it by adding more keyframes on the mask.</p><p><strong><em>3) Pro tips</em></strong></p><p>You can add one more effect in Filmora to make it more magical. To do this, open the Effects window on the top left and find “Heartbeat” under the Basic section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-10.jpg"                      alt="add one more effect in filmora"                ></p><p>Drag and drop it onto the third video track and start the effect when the mask opens up. Then, trim the effect length to match the movement. Adjust the speed of this effect if needed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-11.jpg"                      alt="adjust the speed of this effect"                ></p><p>The final result will look like this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-12.gif"                      alt="final result"                ></p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>That is how to do this night-to-day transition night-to-day time shift effect in Filmora. By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to use the masking transition technique. You can apply and adjust it based on your needs.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="Find-Out-About-MAGIX-Vegas-Pro-Pricing-Plan-and-Features-to-See-How-the-Software-Can-Help-You-with-Your-Video-Editing-Tasks"><a href="#Find-Out-About-MAGIX-Vegas-Pro-Pricing-Plan-and-Features-to-See-How-the-Software-Can-Help-You-with-Your-Video-Editing-Tasks" class="headerlink" title="Find Out About MAGIX Vegas Pro Pricing Plan and Features to See How the Software Can Help You with Your Video Editing Tasks"></a>Find Out About MAGIX Vegas Pro Pricing Plan and Features to See How the Software Can Help You with Your Video Editing Tasks</h2><p>MAGIX Vegas Pro is a powerful and flexible solution for editing, creating, and adding a finishing touch to your videos.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-To-Make-a-Timelapse-in-After-Effects"><a href="#How-To-Make-a-Timelapse-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="How To Make a Timelapse in After Effects"></a>How To Make a Timelapse in After Effects</h2><p>Time-Lapse movies are great for a variety of projects; you can use them as establishing shots in sitcoms, corporate marketing videos, and they can make lovely backgrounds for animated slideshows. A time-lapse video is essentially a series of photographs taken at regular intervals to depict how the environment changes gradually over a shorter period of time. In this article, we’ll demonstrate how you may quickly and easily build an After Effects time-lapse effect.</p><p>With that said, let’s start!</p><h2 id="Step-1-Create-a-new-composition"><a href="#Step-1-Create-a-new-composition" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Create a new composition"></a>Step 1. Create a new composition</h2><p>Calculating your composition length to accommodate the frame rate and number of images is the first step in generating a time-lapse video.</p><ol><li>Verify the number of images you have for your Sequence.</li><li>New Composition Creation. Selecting a frame rate: A time lapse film produced at 30 frames per second will flow smoothly, but you can select any frame rate you like.</li><li>To determine the duration of your composition, divide the number of photographs you have by the frame rate you’ve chosen. For instance, if you use 600 photos at 30 frames per second, your composition will last 20 seconds.</li></ol><h2 id="Step-2-Import-your-images"><a href="#Step-2-Import-your-images" class="headerlink" title="Step 2. Import your images"></a>Step 2. Import your images</h2><p>You are prepared to make a time-lapse sequence if all of your photographs are saved to the same folder and are in the same order. If you are working directly from your Camera, you will likely have Camera Raw files, although this procedure works with PNG and JPEG sequences.</p><ol><li>Press Command&#x2F;Control I on your keyboard or select File &gt; Import. Find the folder holding your image sequence.</li><li>To begin, select the first picture in the sequence. If all of your images have accurate names, After Effects will be able to identify a sequence of images.</li><li>Make sure the Force Alphabetical Order and Camera Raw Sequence checkboxes are selected. Your Time-Lapse Sequence will display in the Project Browser Panel after you click Import.</li><li>Once you’ve watched how it plays, you can adjust the Frame Rate by right-clicking the Sequence in the Project Browser and selecting Interpret Footage &gt; Main.</li><li>To update your time-lapse, modify the Frame Rate setting and click OK.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-images-into-after-effects.jpg"                      alt="import images into after effects"                ></p><h2 id="Step-3-Create-movements"><a href="#Step-3-Create-movements" class="headerlink" title="Step 3. Create movements"></a>Step 3. Create movements</h2><ol><li>After Effects’ Time-Lapse Sequence can be used just like any other standalone clip. This implies that you may give your time-lapse clip movement by adding Keyframes and Effects.</li><li>Place your Playhead at the beginning of the clip after choosing the Image Sequence. Make a keyframe for the scale or position.</li><li>To generate a second Keyframe for the value of your choice, move to the end of the clip. Make any necessary Clip modifications.</li><li>Right-click on the timeline, choose New &gt; Adjustment Layer, then add your effects to the Adjustment Layer to add effects like noise and grain.</li></ol><h2 id="Step-4-Create-slow-motion-from-a-video"><a href="#Step-4-Create-slow-motion-from-a-video" class="headerlink" title="Step 4. Create slow motion from a video"></a>Step 4. Create slow motion from a video</h2><p>You can import your video after you’ve shot it to prepare it for editing. The same steps, including naming your photos in order, must be taken for the Time Lapse sequence. It may be advantageous to entirely rename both your Image Sequence and Performer clip.</p><ol><li>Drag the finished Time Lapse sequence to your Timeline after completing it as previously explained.</li><li>Over the Time Lapse, add the Performer Clip to the Timeline.</li><li>Choose Time&gt;Time Stretch by performing a right-click on the performer clip.</li><li>You can alter the Stretch Factor or Duration in the dialogue box. When you alter one parameter, the other will reflect the new Stretch Factor or Duration for you.</li></ol><h2 id="Step-5-Make-an-overlay"><a href="#Step-5-Make-an-overlay" class="headerlink" title="Step 5. Make an overlay"></a>Step 5. Make an overlay</h2><p>You can alter the Stretch Factor or Duration in the dialogue box. When you alter one parameter, the other will reflect the new Stretch Factor or Duration for you.</p><ol><li>Find Luma Key in the Effect Control Panel and drag it to your clip.</li><li>Change the Key Type setting in the Effect Control Panel to Key Out Brighter.</li><li>The Threshold, Tolerance, and Edge settings should be adjusted until only the silhouette is visible.</li><li>Use the Pen or Mask Tool to create a circle around the parts you want to delete if you discover any corners of your clip that are still visible.</li><li>Add any Effects, such as Light Leaks, to your Adjustment Layer by choosing “Right-click &gt; New &gt; Adjustment layer.”</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/make-an-overlay-after-effects.jpg"                      alt="make an overlay after effects"                ></p><p>After Effects CC must be opened, a new project must be created, the Import File menu option must be selected, and the appropriate folder containing the altered still images must be located and selected before the time-lapse photos can be turned into a film. You need to make sure that the JPEG Series box is checked, as well as the Force Alphabetical Order box.</p><p>Once you have clicked on the first image in the sequence. The time-lapse video that you uploaded appears in the project library. After performing a right-click on the filename, select “New Comp from Selection” from the context menu.</p><h2 id="Step-6-Exporting-your-video"><a href="#Step-6-Exporting-your-video" class="headerlink" title="Step 6. Exporting your video"></a>Step 6. Exporting your video</h2><p>After getting our sequence to perform some kind of slow, understated animation so that it appears as though the camera is moving dramatically, we will need to export a video file. Go to File &gt; Export &gt; Add to Render Queue, then open the Render Queue dialog box by going to Window &gt; Render Queue. From there, you can choose the Output Module and change the settings in the options dialog box. Finally, choose the Output To option and select the location on your computer where you would like to save the video clip that we are currently rendering and exporting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/add-to-render-queue-after-effects.jpg"                      alt="add to render queue after effects"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>No matter how you make your time lapse videos, After Effects has a ton of features you can use to modify and enhance the way they look. Now that you are familiar with the fundamentals, you can play with the Frame Rates and Composition options.

<p>Step 1</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, go ahead and download the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Install it and run the application on your computer.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/fps.png"
                      alt="project settings filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3</p>
<p>Select the Titles tab and drag the Default Title to the Timeline.</p>

                      alt="add new title filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4</p>
<p>Double-click on the Default Title inside the Timeline and go to <strong>Advanced.</strong> Here, you can change the text, pick a new font, change its size, and so on. Make sure you change the Color Type to <strong>Gradient Fill.</strong> Choose a color of your own liking. When you’re done customizing it, click on <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img

                      alt="advanced text settings"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5</p>
<p>Right-click on the Default Title clip and select <strong>Copy.</strong> Then, right-click anywhere on the Timeline and select <strong>Paste.</strong> After this, drag the copy of that clip on the Track above it.</p>

                      alt="copy clip in filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6</p>
<p>Double-click on the copied Title, go to <strong>Advanced,</strong> and change the Color Type to <strong>Color Fill.</strong> Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>

                      alt="color type fill"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7</p>
<p>Next, take a snapshot of the new title. Then, delete the copied Title clip from your Timeline. After this, drag the snapshot into the Timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="snapshot filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8</p>
<p>Double-click on the Snapshot clip and go to the <strong>Mask</strong> tab. From here, select the <strong>Rectangle</strong> mask. Then, rotate it as you see in the image below. Don’t click on OK yet.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="add mask filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 9</p>
<p>Now, look at the settings panel on the left and scroll down. First, change its <strong>Rotation</strong> to <strong>40</strong>. Then, drag the <strong>Blur</strong> bar to <strong>15</strong>. Finally, move the Rectangle mask to the left side like in the image below. Don’t click OK yet.</p>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotation.png"
                      alt="mask settings filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 10</p>
<p>Now, move the Playhead to the starting position on the Timeline. Then, click on the “**+Add**” button to add a keyframe. Next, move the Playhead a few seconds forward and move the Rectangle mask all the way to the right side of the text. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add keyframe filmora"
                ></p>

<p>After a successful video shoot, video editing tends to wrap up the video production process. However, a video cannot be enlivened by using simple video editing tools, i.e., cut, crop, and trim, but rather tools such as cinematic color grading. Usually, directors want their video to evoke their intended ambiance and appear more realistic – This can only be achieved through cinematic color grading.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Color grading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the alteration and enhancement of color in a video, motion picture, or still image. Color grading is an essential tool for videographers since it enables them to enhance the mood or tone. Stick to this article and learn about the eight tips to apply cinematic color grading to your video.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Don’t Make These Mistakes!</a></p>
<p>02 <a href="#part2">8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</a></p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes"><a href="#Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make These Mistakes"></a>Don’t Make These Mistakes</h2><p>Even though to err is human, there are some mistakes that colorists and video editors need to avoid at all costs. It is not only because they will make them look amateurish but also undermines the message and impact of the video.</p>
<p>Some people assume color grading is as simple as adding filters to their Instagram photos which they are absolutely wrong. Color grading is a long and frustrating process, and it only requires “persons with a thick skin.”</p>
<p>Some mistakes are not only committed by amateurs alone but also professional colorists who are in a rush to complete their projects on due time. Usually, these mistakes degrade the quality output. Some of the mistakes that one needs not make include:</p>
<h4 id="1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor"><a href="#1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor" class="headerlink" title="1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor"></a>1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor</h4><p>Almost every videographer and colorist’s goal is to design footages that distinctively display their primary colors and decipher the intended message. And this can only be achieved using a properly calibrated monitor.</p>
<p>Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.</p>
<h4 id="2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage"><a href="#2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage" class="headerlink" title="2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage"></a>2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage</h4><p>One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.</p>
<p>Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.</p>
<p>The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.</p>
<h4 id="3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow"><a href="#3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow" class="headerlink" title="3. Imbalancing the Shadow"></a>3. Imbalancing the Shadow</h4><p>Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.</p>
<p>This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.</p>
<h4 id="4-Overusing-LUTs"><a href="#4-Overusing-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="4. Overusing LUTs"></a>4. Overusing LUTs</h4><p>A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.</p>
<p>When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.</p>
<h4 id="5-Having-Limited-break"><a href="#5-Having-Limited-break" class="headerlink" title="5. Having Limited break"></a>5. Having Limited break</h4><p>Having enough break enables one’s eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.</p>
<p>Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.</p>
<h2 id="8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-1"><a href="#8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video"></a>8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</h2><p>When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.</p>
<p>For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation"><a href="#1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation"></a>1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation</h4><p>The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.</p>
<p>The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.</p>
<p>Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.</p>

<h4 id="2-Use-Cosmo-functionality-to-adjust-skin-tones"><a href="#2-Use-Cosmo-functionality-to-adjust-skin-tones" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones"></a>2. Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones</h4><p>Due to the light effect, shots taken during the day will have inconsistent color matches, especially skin tone. In the post-production process, one needs to make uniformity in skin tone and the clip. To rectify this, you need to involve a professional color grading functionality, Cosmo.</p>
<p>With cosmo, you can adjust the skin color, squeeze the skin, and soften the skin. Generally, Cosmo makes people in video clips look their best.</p>

<h4 id="3-Use-Highlights-and-Shadows-adjustment"><a href="#3-Use-Highlights-and-Shadows-adjustment" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment"></a>3. Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment</h4><p>A clip will look more cinematic when the shadows and highlights are brought out as separate entities. The shadows become more vivid when adjusted to either teal, purple or blue. You can go a mile and adjust the highlights to become crystal clear by making the footage become yellow, red, or orange.</p>
<p>When carrying out color grading, you need to know the various video demands, such as the horror clips demand more of the dark shadow.</p>

<p>After a successful video shoot, video editing tends to wrap up the video production process. However, a video cannot be enlivened by using simple video editing tools, i.e., cut, crop, and trim, but rather tools such as cinematic color grading. Usually, directors want their video to evoke their intended ambiance and appear more realistic – This can only be achieved through cinematic color grading.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Color grading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the alteration and enhancement of color in a video, motion picture, or still image. Color grading is an essential tool for videographers since it enables them to enhance the mood or tone. Stick to this article and learn about the eight tips to apply cinematic color grading to your video.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-1"><a href="#In-this-article-1" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Don’t Make These Mistakes!</a></p>
<p>02 <a href="#part2">8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</a></p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes-1"><a href="#Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes-1" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make These Mistakes"></a>Don’t Make These Mistakes</h2><p>Even though to err is human, there are some mistakes that colorists and video editors need to avoid at all costs. It is not only because they will make them look amateurish but also undermines the message and impact of the video.</p>
<p>Some people assume color grading is as simple as adding filters to their Instagram photos which they are absolutely wrong. Color grading is a long and frustrating process, and it only requires “persons with a thick skin.”</p>
<p>Some mistakes are not only committed by amateurs alone but also professional colorists who are in a rush to complete their projects on due time. Usually, these mistakes degrade the quality output. Some of the mistakes that one needs not make include:</p>
<h4 id="1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor-1"><a href="#1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor"></a>1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor</h4><p>Almost every videographer and colorist’s goal is to design footages that distinctively display their primary colors and decipher the intended message. And this can only be achieved using a properly calibrated monitor.</p>
<p>Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.</p>
<h4 id="2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-1"><a href="#2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage"></a>2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage</h4><p>One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.</p>
<p>Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.</p>
<p>The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.</p>
<h4 id="3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-1"><a href="#3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Imbalancing the Shadow"></a>3. Imbalancing the Shadow</h4><p>Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.</p>
<p>This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.</p>
<h4 id="4-Overusing-LUTs-1"><a href="#4-Overusing-LUTs-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Overusing LUTs"></a>4. Overusing LUTs</h4><p>A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.</p>
<p>When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.</p>
<h4 id="5-Having-Limited-break-1"><a href="#5-Having-Limited-break-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Having Limited break"></a>5. Having Limited break</h4><p>Having enough break enables one’s eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.</p>
<p>Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.</p>
<h2 id="8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-2"><a href="#8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video"></a>8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</h2><p>When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.</p>
<p>For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation-1"><a href="#1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation"></a>1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation</h4><p>The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.</p>
<p>The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.</p>
<p>Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.</p>

Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones</h4><p>Due to the light effect, shots taken during the day will have inconsistent color matches, especially skin tone. In the post-production process, one needs to make uniformity in skin tone and the clip. To rectify this, you need to involve a professional color grading functionality, Cosmo.</p>
<p>With cosmo, you can adjust the skin color, squeeze the skin, and soften the skin. Generally, Cosmo makes people in video clips look their best.</p>

Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment</h4><p>A clip will look more cinematic when the shadows and highlights are brought out as separate entities. The shadows become more vivid when adjusted to either teal, purple or blue. You can go a mile and adjust the highlights to become crystal clear by making the footage become yellow, red, or orange.</p>
<p>When carrying out color grading, you need to know the various video demands, such as the horror clips demand more of the dark shadow.</p>

<p>This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.</p>
<h4 id="4-Overusing-LUTs-2"><a href="#4-Overusing-LUTs-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Overusing LUTs"></a>4. Overusing LUTs</h4><p>A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.</p>
<p>When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.</p>
<h4 id="5-Having-Limited-break-2"><a href="#5-Having-Limited-break-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Having Limited break"></a>5. Having Limited break</h4><p>Having enough break enables one’s eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.</p>
<p>Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.</p>

<p>02 <a href="#part2">8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</a></p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes-3"><a href="#Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes-3" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make These Mistakes"></a>Don’t Make These Mistakes</h2><p>Even though to err is human, there are some mistakes that colorists and video editors need to avoid at all costs. It is not only because they will make them look amateurish but also undermines the message and impact of the video.</p>
<p>Some people assume color grading is as simple as adding filters to their Instagram photos which they are absolutely wrong. Color grading is a long and frustrating process, and it only requires “persons with a thick skin.”</p>
<p>Some mistakes are not only committed by amateurs alone but also professional colorists who are in a rush to complete their projects on due time. Usually, these mistakes degrade the quality output. Some of the mistakes that one needs not make include:</p>
<h4 id="1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor-3"><a href="#1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor"></a>1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor</h4><p>Almost every videographer and colorist’s goal is to design footages that distinctively display their primary colors and decipher the intended message. And this can only be achieved using a properly calibrated monitor.</p>
<p>Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.</p>
<h4 id="2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-3"><a href="#2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage"></a>2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage</h4><p>One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.</p>
<p>Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.</p>
<p>The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.</p>
<h4 id="3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-3"><a href="#3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Imbalancing the Shadow"></a>3.

It catches the attention of viewers through different scenes of a clip.</p>
<p>So, here we have mentioned some iPhone video editing softwares that can at least do basic speed changes. but most of them can also do advanced speed ramping. These are as follows:</p>

It also supports multiple layers. It has built-in effects, transitions, and presets to speed up the editing process.</p>
<p>It is a paid video editor but you can try it for free, free trial includes most of the features but it leaves a watermark on export.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>

<h3 id="Cutting"><a href="#Cutting" class="headerlink" title="Cutting"></a>Cutting</h3><p>Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places.

<h3 id="Method-1-Trim-Clips-on-Timeline"><a href="#Method-1-Trim-Clips-on-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Method 1:Trim Clips on Timeline"></a>Method 1:Trim Clips on Timeline</h3><p>If you are wondering: What is a timeline? It’s the area Premiere Pro where you arrange your videos and map out the edits you want to apply. You will see all your video clips, transitions, effects, and more laid out in chronological order while you are working on your project. You can Premiere Pro trim video clips on the timeline, and at any point, play your project to check how your edits will look.</p>

<h3 id="How-to-Trim-a-Video-without-Re-Rendering"><a href="#How-to-Trim-a-Video-without-Re-Rendering" class="headerlink" title="How to Trim a Video without Re-Rendering?"></a>How to Trim a Video without Re-Rendering?</h3><p>When adding a video to Premiere Pro, it will be rendered by this software application to ensure high-quality playback and speed. Rendering takes time afterward, leading to loss of quality; however, it makes sure you have gotten the best video quality as much as possible by removing skipped frames and lag from the video playback.</p>
<p>If you are wondering how to trim videos in Premiere Pro without re-render follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import your video to Premiere Pro by launching the application and choosing ‘Import Media to Start’. Browse and select the video you want to trim.</li>
<li>The video will appear in the media library area at the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the video from the media library to the timeline. You’ll see the complete video clip duration in the timeline.</li>
<li>You can crop the video by dragging the blue time marker to the duration where you would like to start the video.</li>
<li>Hold the ‘Ctrl’ key on your keyboard, then drag the starting end of the video clip to the time marker position. You’ll remove unnecessary video content from the beginning of your video.</li>
<li>You can trim the video from its other end by following the same steps but from the opposite direction. You can only use this method to trim from one of the ends of your video clip.</li>
<li>Choose the ‘Laser Tool’ located at the side menu of the timeline to trim from the center of the video clip. Now, click on the clip at the position you want to trim, and the application will cut the video from this position.</li>
<li>Follow steps 2 to 4 to trim from cuts you’ve just made.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Unlink-Audio-and-Video-for-Trimming"><a href="#Unlink-Audio-and-Video-for-Trimming" class="headerlink" title="Unlink Audio and Video for Trimming"></a>Unlink Audio and Video for Trimming</h3><p>When you upload a video file to Adobe Premiere Pro and take it into the timeline, the audio tracks and video will be synced and locked. Essentially, this ensures there is no misalignment when the program converts the video to another format. For example, importing it into another video editor can cause a mis-sync between audio and video if the two tracks are not locked or linked.</p>
<p>Video editing professionals avoid this by locking the two tracks together. As such, you might want to unlink or unlock the two before doing anything. To do this, you need to import the video into the application and take it to the timeline with the associated tracks. Then, select the video track alone.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="unlink audio from video in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p>Next, right-click the video track and select the Unlink option. The software will separate the audio from the video track. You can now trim either of these.</p>

<ol>
<li>Launch Premiere Pro and navigate to File, then choose import. Find the video that you want to trim and double click on it.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the video into the timeline.</li>
<li>Choose the ‘Ripple Edit Tool’ and then Press ‘Sequence’. Head to ‘Sequence Settings’ and set or modify the codec, bitrate, name, format, and much more.</li>
<li>Adjust the Ripple so that it defines the end time and start time that you want for your video.</li>
<li>Now, finalize the trim by choosing ‘File’ and tap ‘Export’. To ‘Export Settings,’ elect ‘Media’.</li>

At first sight, you’ll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let’s look at the differences between these two operations.</p>
<h3 id="Trimming-2"><a href="#Trimming-2" class="headerlink" title="Trimming"></a>Trimming</h3><p>Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.</p>
<p>The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers’ attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.</p>
<h3 id="Cutting-2"><a href="#Cutting-2" class="headerlink" title="Cutting"></a>Cutting</h3><p>Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You’ll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.</p>
<p>This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What’s more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.</p>
<p>You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.</p>
<p>People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.</p>

At first sight, you’ll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let’s look at the differences between these two operations.</p>
<h3 id="Trimming-3"><a href="#Trimming-3" class="headerlink" title="Trimming"></a>Trimming</h3><p>Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.</p>
<p>The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers’ attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.</p>
<h3 id="Cutting-3"><a href="#Cutting-3" class="headerlink" title="Cutting"></a>Cutting</h3><p>Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You’ll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.</p>
<p>This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What’s more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.</p>
<p>You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.</p>
<p>People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.</p>

Rendering takes time afterward, leading to loss of quality; however, it makes sure you have gotten the best video quality as much as possible by removing skipped frames and lag from the video playback.</p>
<p>If you are wondering how to trim videos in Premiere Pro without re-render follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import your video to Premiere Pro by launching the application and choosing ‘Import Media to Start’. Browse and select the video you want to trim.</li>
<li>The video will appear in the media library area at the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the video from the media library to the timeline. You’ll see the complete video clip duration in the timeline.</li>
<li>You can crop the video by dragging the blue time marker to the duration where you would like to start the video.</li>
<li>Hold the ‘Ctrl’ key on your keyboard, then drag the starting end of the video clip to the time marker position. You’ll remove unnecessary video content from the beginning of your video.</li>
<li>You can trim the video from its other end by following the same steps but from the opposite direction. You can only use this method to trim from one of the ends of your video clip.</li>
<li>Choose the ‘Laser Tool’ located at the side menu of the timeline to trim from the center of the video clip. Now, click on the clip at the position you want to trim, and the application will cut the video from this position.</li>
<li>Follow steps 2 to 4 to trim from cuts you’ve just made.</li>

Essentially, this ensures there is no misalignment when the program converts the video to another format. For example, importing it into another video editor can cause a mis-sync between audio and video if the two tracks are not locked or linked.</p>
<p>Video editing professionals avoid this by locking the two tracks together. As such, you might want to unlink or unlock the two before doing anything. To do this, you need to import the video into the application and take it to the timeline with the associated tracks. Then, select the video track alone.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="unlink audio from video in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p>Next, right-click the video track and select the Unlink option. The software will separate the audio from the video track. You can now trim either of these.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed User Guide to Create Aquasoft Slideshow</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download the Software Program</strong></p>
<p>Visit the official Aquasoft website to initiate a free download the slideshow product kit to your Windows or MacOS compatible system and proceed to install and launch the software.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Project Selection</strong></p>
<p>Launching the Aquasoft slideshow program successfully will guide you to the latter’s welcome interface, where you will have to select a new slideshow project in the 4:3 aspect ratio. Move ahead with selecting a presentation layout by navigating to the ‘View’ tab in the toolbar at the top and clicking on the ‘Layout’ option from its dropdown menu. You will also see the project ‘Timeline’ appear at this instant.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Your Images</strong></p>
<p>When you are done with choosing the layout, navigate to the top toolbar again and hit the ‘Add’ tab. From the dropdown that follows, click on ‘Images’ to include a photo within the presentation. You can also include a complete directory of images by selecting the ‘Directory’ option from the ‘Add’ dropdown. Your chosen images will appear in the project ‘Timeline’.</p>
<p>If you want to rearrange the order of the selected images, you can do so by clicking on the ‘Edit’ tab in the toolbar at the top, followed by choosing the ‘Sort’ option from the dropdown that follows next. The app sets the images in a natural logical order, while also allowing you to rearrange them manually.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Adding Images"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Include a Background Music</strong></p>
<p>To complement your <strong>Aquasoft Slideshow Ultimate</strong> presentation with a suitable background audio, visit the top toolbar and click on the ‘Add’ tab and select ‘Background Music’ from the list of options that appears next. A series of music titles will appear as you click on the ‘+’ icon in the ‘Background Music’ interface. You are allowed to reset the order of the listed music files through a mouse click.</p>
<p>If you want to remove the music titles, click on the ‘Trash Bin’ icon beside the ‘+’ button. To adjust the settings of a particular music tile, click on the same and make suitable parameter adjustments. When you are satisfied with the changes, click ‘OK’. Your final selections of the background music will appear in the app’s project timeline.</p>

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Including Background Music"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Let’s Play!</strong></p>
<p>You can choose to play your slideshow at this stage with simple elements of images and music. All you need to do is, navigate to the ‘Menu Bar’ below the top toolbar and click on Play’ button. You can alternatively press the F9 key from your system’s keyboard to run the slideshow. The app works intelligently to supplement your presentation with random transition effects that play a new animation every time you run the slideshow.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the default arrangements, you can also proceed to make adjustments in the transition play duration and even customize a transition style of your own with text and effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Playing the Presentation"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Adjust Your Image Properties</strong></p>
<p>To proceed with making adjustments to specific image characteristics, select the desired image and its properties will appear at the right side. You can now work with assigning a particular transition, comments and text to the image, while also making adjustments to the image screen time.</p>
<p>For adhering to the concern of adjusting the play durations of several images in a single instant, select them in the ‘Image List’ through the ‘Ctrl+ A’ command from your system’s keyboard and enter a specific play duration. Your entry will be applied to all the selected images.</p>
<p>You can however, escape the 2-way process by navigating to the ‘Program Settings’ tab and adjusting the pre-set image play duration. Your changes will be applicable to all the slideshow images that have their ‘Use Default Duration’ option enabled.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Add Suitable Transitions</strong></p>
<p>If the randomly included transitions of the slideshow program do not suit your presentation style, choose to add your preferred one from the software’s ‘Transition Library’ and tap the ‘Adjust’ button to customise the properties of your selection. You can also click on the ‘Play’ icon in the ‘Menu Bar’ and run the slideshow from the current image to see how the applied transition appears over the image.</p>

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Adding Transitions"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Text Customizations</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Images’ menu and hit the ‘Text’ tab to include text add-on within the slideshow images while formatting them suitably. You can further, add animations to the text and customize them to stay with or leave the text after the image play duration is over, by tapping the ‘Edit’ button. To present a combined play of text and image, while avoiding the separate text animation, click on the ‘Show Text with Image’ checkbox at the bottom right corner of the ‘Images’ menu.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9: Add Comments to the Images</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Sound’ tab and enable your system’s microphone to add recorded comments to your slideshow. Start with clicking on the ‘Record’ button and narrate the comment. Don’t worry about the sync of image and comment play durations as the software program will automatically adjust both to be in line with each other.</p>
<p>If you are interested to add a particular sound file to a specific image, navigate to the ‘Yellow Folder’ at the top right corner to make your selection.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11: Collage Creation</strong></p>
<p>Try hands at including a collage in your slideshow to play several numbers of images and texts within the same time frame. To do this, navigate to the ‘Object Toolbar’ at the bottom of the project timeline and select the ‘Collage’ object, followed by dragging the same to the ‘Image List’ to add the latter to your presentation. Once you are done with this, proceed to choose the desired images that you wish to add to the collage, succeeded by dragging the same to the ‘Collage’ object.</p>
<p>Move ahead with expanding the collage, to ensure a proper display of the images. You can further, apply selected transitions to the created collage under the latter’s ‘Object Settings’.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Creating an Image Collage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 12: Edit Your Collage</strong></p>
<p>Start with selecting the first image of your collage and adjusting its size in the ‘Layout Designer’ through the position frame at the edges of the photo. Next, you can proceed with positioning the image at the desired place within the collage. Repeat the process till all the images in your collage are at their respective places and within the respective size ratio.</p>
<p>Move ahead with including a relevant text at the end of your collage by selecting the ‘Text’ object in the bottom toolbar. Navigate to the last image of your collage and tap on ‘Text’ object to include it within the last image. You can make suitable formatting adjustments to the added text in the ‘Text’ tab of the ‘Object Settings’. Position your text at the appropriate place within the image and check a preview of the same by clicking on the ‘Play’ button in the ‘Menu Bar’ above the project timeline.</p>

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Editing the Collage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 13: Including a Chapter</strong></p>

Start with selecting the ‘Chapter’ object from the ‘Object Toolbar’ to insert the former in the timeline, followed by dragging 2 images into the same. Tap the ‘Play’ button to open the chapter and add suitable text and animation to it in similar way as you would do for a collage.

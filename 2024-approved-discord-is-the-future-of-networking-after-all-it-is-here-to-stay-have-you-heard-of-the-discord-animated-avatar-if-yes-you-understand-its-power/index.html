<p>Discord is no secret, gradually becoming one of the most popular platforms for everyone. And why not when it allows users to communicate via different channels, including video calls, texts, media, voice calls, and files through private channels.</p>
<p>The digital platform is under Discord Inc and became official a while back. It operates under multiple operating systems, including macOS, Android, Linux, iOS, Android, iPadOS, and web browsers. As a result, it is an excellent way for everyone. The platform has risen to fame in the last six months, with many people using it.</p>
<p>As much as the platform is doing great, many things often arise, especially creating <strong>Discord GIF Avatar</strong>. In other words, how to deliver the best PFP or avatar for your account. Since Discord has recently gained maximum fame, there are fewer details. Fortunately, this article is here to save the day.

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-is-Discord-Becoming-Popular-Recently"><a href="#Part-1-Why-is-Discord-Becoming-Popular-Recently" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why is Discord Becoming Popular Recently?"></a>Part 1 Why is Discord Becoming Popular Recently?</h2><p>How often do you visit social media? You probably know that the current trending networking platform is Discord if it is frequent. After all, it has risen to fame with millions of users in no time. Plus, the introduction of the <strong>GIF Avatar Discord</strong> has left many fans amazed with the application. You can also confirm its popularity with the many friends using it.</p>
<p>Discord features multiple good points that explain why most people love it, including the <strong>avatar Discord GIF.</strong> However, many people still question its popularity and its rise recently. As a result, this section will answer this question using relevant facts.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>It is suitable for gaming communication:</strong> Discord is primarily popular among gamers. The platform is new, but it has quickly overtaken its competitors, Skype and TeamSpeak. Why? Many gamers consider it a revolutionized application that solves all their worries making gaming communication bigger and better. Before Discord, gaming communication was difficult and dangerous. After all, you need to share personal Skype details that connect with your phone, making it a not-safe option. When we consider TeamSpeak, you realize that it is limiting with the option available since you only have a voice call. Discord brings out the best network channel; gamers and friends have quickly started using it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Most services are free: Discord includes multiple benefits that make</strong> communication straightforward and convenient. Luckily, most of the services available are free, meaning that almost everyone can access them. As a result, many people would quickly settle for Discord compared to other platforms since you can get so much at no cost. Currently, they have the <strong>Discord Nitro gif avatar</strong>, which is affordable and multiplies the fun.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create Discord bots are no cost:</strong> Discord allows users to create bots for free without including any hosting fee hence an affordable option.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Constant updates that match the audiences’ needs: Things change in no time for Discord</strong>. Why? The developers are active and listen to the community’s opinion of what they want and why they need it. Therefore, it delivers the show that people urgently need leading to popularity rise.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>It rarely includes ads in private chats:</strong> A platform can become frustrating, mainly when it features multiple ads every minute. However, Discord is different since it almost has no ads. Therefore, people can freely chat with friends and other gamers.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Discord is safe:</strong> The settings under Discord are safe since they include suitable privacy options and monitoring. Thus, it is a safe option. But many people often raise the question of open chatting in apps and the security issues that come with them. Many people can confirm that Discord is a safe option and if you feel otherwise, ensure that you only add friends you know.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Discord-Emojis"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Discord-Emojis" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?"></a>Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?</h2><p>From the information above, you can tell that Discord’s primary role is communication. And we all know that emojis are the real deal in every conversation since emojis easily communicate our feelings. Currently, most platforms with messaging options include emojis to multiply the fun. The same case happens for Discord emojis. They are there to make communication appealing, interesting, funny and reveal how you feel about a situation.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of Discord emojis</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Emojis help you to communicate the right emotions</strong>. Sometimes, it’s impossible to express the right feelings using words, and emojis come to the rescue in such situations. Of course, they are useless for formal communication, but Discord holds a considerable weight for various issues.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>They are fun and exciting</strong>. Sometimes you can choose to use an emoji instead of writing some phrase, and this option works for all. Besides, it feels good to see different emojis instead of a long paragraph that tells the same story.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Emojis make communication easy</strong>. We are in the 21st century with multiple revolutionary changes with our communication channels. Young people prefer emojis for different conversations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>It offers a sense of presence in a conversation</strong>. People believed that they could only hold exciting discussions when they were together. Over time, this statement has been proved impossible since we can’t always be there to hold serious talks. We need Discord emojis since they give a sense of physical presence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>They liven up a serious conversation</strong>. Have you ever noticed, people tend to include emojis when having serious talks making them more casual and creating a friendly environment that suits everyone? And this trick often works.</p>
<p>Discord emojis are conversation aids that every communication channel need. Why not, when it gives a sense of friendliness. Try out the Discord emojis and discover the simplest ways to make a conversation lively.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-Discord-Emoji-GIF"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-Discord-Emoji-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Create Discord Emoji GIF"></a>Part 3 How to Create Discord Emoji GIF</h2><p>There are two popular ways to create an emoji <strong>Discord GIF avatar, Discord Nitro animated avatar</strong> and <strong>Discord GIF avatar without Nitro.</strong> The emoji GIF you make depends on the Nitro version you are using.</p>
<p>Creating a Discord account is simple and free, not even considering the hosting cost. However, the developers include the Discord Nitro version, which contains multiple features that make conversations bigger and better. However, the Nitro version is a paid subscription of $4.99 monthly. Creating a discord emoji GIF is quite simple if you are under the later version. After all, it includes the available GIF options that you can choose from depending on your taste. However, if you are under the free option, you won’t have this option.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>It is suitable for gaming communication:</strong> Discord is primarily popular among gamers. The platform is new, but it has quickly overtaken its competitors, Skype and TeamSpeak. Why? Many gamers consider it a revolutionized application that solves all their worries making gaming communication bigger and better. Before Discord, gaming communication was difficult and dangerous.

Discord brings out the best network channel; gamers and friends have quickly started using it.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>It rarely includes ads in private chats:</strong> A platform can become frustrating, mainly when it features multiple ads every minute. However, Discord is different since it almost has no ads. Therefore, people can freely chat with friends and other gamers.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Discord is safe:</strong> The settings under Discord are safe since they include suitable privacy options and monitoring. Thus, it is a safe option. But many people often raise the question of open chatting in apps and the security issues that come with them. Many people can confirm that Discord is a safe option and if you feel otherwise, ensure that you only add friends you know.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Discord-Emojis-3"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Discord-Emojis-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?"></a>Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?</h2><p>From the information above, you can tell that Discord’s primary role is communication.

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>They are fun and exciting</strong>. Sometimes you can choose to use an emoji instead of writing some phrase, and this option works for all. Besides, it feels good to see different emojis instead of a long paragraph that tells the same story.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Emojis make communication easy</strong>. We are in the 21st century with multiple revolutionary changes with our communication channels. Young people prefer emojis for different conversations.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Popular-text-effects-in-Filmora"><a href="#Part-1-Popular-text-effects-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Popular text effects in Filmora"></a>Part 1. Popular text effects in Filmora</h2><p>There are unlimited text effects available in Filmora but some of them are extremely popular that video creators regularly use in their videos. Here is the list of the popular Filmora video editor text effects that you should be aware of.</p>
<h3 id="1-Text-Swipe-Effect"><a href="#1-Text-Swipe-Effect" class="headerlink" title="1. Text Swipe Effect"></a>1. Text Swipe Effect</h3><p>Text swipe effects are the most commonly used in today’s videos on social media and video streaming platforms. In this effect, the text slides into the video frame from a particular direction. The entire text can swipe in if it is a one-liner and it can even swipe in word by word or sentence by sentence.</p>
<p>If you want to show short texts and you do not want to experiment with text animations, the text swipe effect is the safest option. For example, if you want to display your social media handles, your location, a coupon code, or a correction phrase that you have uttered wrongly, text swipe effects should be on your video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Type-Text-Effect"><a href="#2-Type-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="2. Type Text Effect"></a>2. Type Text Effect</h3><p>The type text effect in Filmora is referred to as the typewriter text effect in Premiere Pro and After Effects. The effect displays the text as if it is being typed in real-time as it is done in a typewriter. The characters will appear on the screen with a cursor on the screen and therefore, it takes more duration than most other text effects.</p>
<p>The type text effect is particularly useful when you are displaying a large size of text on the screen. It is also widely used when showing a paragraph of text instead of a simple line. This helps in drawing the attention of the audience to the paragraph and retaining the attention for a longer duration of time.</p>
<h3 id="3-WordArt-Effect"><a href="#3-WordArt-Effect" class="headerlink" title="3. WordArt Effect"></a>3. WordArt Effect</h3><p>WordArt is synonymous with MS Word where large words have 3D effects and highlighted background. Apart from 3D effect, text can have a thick stroke or outline as well as a gradient color style when WordArt effect is applied. In Filmora, you will find a plethora of WordArt effects and some are them are modern while others have a retro feel to them.</p>
<p>The WordArt effect is particularly popular while displaying titles and funny texts on the entire screen or covering a large part of the video. These are mostly used in the opening or ending scenes of the video. Besides, some video creators use them while making transitions from one scene to another.</p>
<h3 id="4-Keyframe"><a href="#4-Keyframe" class="headerlink" title="4. Keyframe"></a>4. Keyframe</h3><p>If you want to create text animations as per your requirements, you have to use keyframes in any video editor. You can always apply the ready-made video editing text effects but if you want to customize and personalize, you can add keyframes in between two timestamps. Thereafter, you need to change text styles and parameters for each frame so that it looks like an animation.</p>
<p>If you want to add uniqueness to text animations so that you can make the audience wonder and appreciate, keyframes are the way. Adding keyframes in the text layer on Filmora is super easy and you can get effects like texts slowly scaling up, dancing randomly, changing fonts, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="5-Color-Text-Effect"><a href="#5-Color-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="5. Color Text Effect"></a>5. Color Text Effect</h3><p>The color text effect is becoming extremely popular and it is widely used for opening and ending credits. Flashing different colors through your texts and titles against a darker background can act as a feast for the human eyes. There are different types of color text effects available that can make your text stand out.</p>
<p>When you are using color text effect, you need to maintain a large font size for your text so that it is widely visible. Even if your background is not dark, you can use a darker box in the background of the text or a darker frame around the text to amplify the effect.</p>
<h3 id="6-Bounce-to-Zoom-Effect"><a href="#6-Bounce-to-Zoom-Effect" class="headerlink" title="6. Bounce to Zoom Effect"></a>6. Bounce to Zoom Effect</h3><p>The bounce to zoom effect is widely used during a transition from one scene to another. It is regarded as a funny text effect where the text can swipe in and bounce and enlarge in size. Alternatively, the characters can bounce individually and zoom in and out with the motion as if they are dancing.</p>
<p>Apart from transitions, you can use the bounce to zoom effect to showcase a few important texts at the bottom of the video so that the viewers notice your text. Generally, the effect lasts for a few seconds before the text disappears. When you are using it for a larger text, you can use it for promotions and advertisements as well.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If texts are an essential part of your video, you should apply amazing video editing text effects to the texts and titles present in your video. You can use the common and the popular video text effects as well as use unique text effects to make your video stand out easily. There is no better video editor to add text effects to your video other than <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for its unlimited text effect and animation templates.</p>
<p>Part 1. Popular text effects in Filmora</p>
<p>There are unlimited text effects available in Filmora but some of them are extremely popular that video creators regularly use in their videos. Here is the list of the popular Filmora video editor text effects that you should be aware of.</p>
<h3 id="1-Text-Swipe-Effect-1"><a href="#1-Text-Swipe-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Text Swipe Effect"></a>1. Text Swipe Effect</h3><p>Text swipe effects are the most commonly used in today’s videos on social media and video streaming platforms. In this effect, the text slides into the video frame from a particular direction. The entire text can swipe in if it is a one-liner and it can even swipe in word by word or sentence by sentence.</p>
<p>If you want to show short texts and you do not want to experiment with text animations, the text swipe effect is the safest option. For example, if you want to display your social media handles, your location, a coupon code, or a correction phrase that you have uttered wrongly, text swipe effects should be on your video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Type-Text-Effect-1"><a href="#2-Type-Text-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Type Text Effect"></a>2. Type Text Effect</h3><p>The type text effect in Filmora is referred to as the typewriter text effect in Premiere Pro and After Effects. The effect displays the text as if it is being typed in real-time as it is done in a typewriter. The characters will appear on the screen with a cursor on the screen and therefore, it takes more duration than most other text effects.</p>
<p>The type text effect is particularly useful when you are displaying a large size of text on the screen. It is also widely used when showing a paragraph of text instead of a simple line. This helps in drawing the attention of the audience to the paragraph and retaining the attention for a longer duration of time.</p>
<h3 id="3-WordArt-Effect-1"><a href="#3-WordArt-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="3. WordArt Effect"></a>3. WordArt Effect</h3><p>WordArt is synonymous with MS Word where large words have 3D effects and highlighted background. Apart from 3D effect, text can have a thick stroke or outline as well as a gradient color style when WordArt effect is applied. In Filmora, you will find a plethora of WordArt effects and some are them are modern while others have a retro feel to them.</p>
<p>The WordArt effect is particularly popular while displaying titles and funny texts on the entire screen or covering a large part of the video. These are mostly used in the opening or ending scenes of the video. Besides, some video creators use them while making transitions from one scene to another.</p>
<h3 id="4-Keyframe-1"><a href="#4-Keyframe-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Keyframe"></a>4. Keyframe</h3><p>If you want to create text animations as per your requirements, you have to use keyframes in any video editor. You can always apply the ready-made video editing text effects but if you want to customize and personalize, you can add keyframes in between two timestamps. Thereafter, you need to change text styles and parameters for each frame so that it looks like an animation.</p>
<p>If you want to add uniqueness to text animations so that you can make the audience wonder and appreciate, keyframes are the way. Adding keyframes in the text layer on Filmora is super easy and you can get effects like texts slowly scaling up, dancing randomly, changing fonts, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="5-Color-Text-Effect-1"><a href="#5-Color-Text-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Color Text Effect"></a>5. Color Text Effect</h3><p>The color text effect is becoming extremely popular and it is widely used for opening and ending credits. Flashing different colors through your texts and titles against a darker background can act as a feast for the human eyes. There are different types of color text effects available that can make your text stand out.</p>
<p>When you are using color text effect, you need to maintain a large font size for your text so that it is widely visible. Even if your background is not dark, you can use a darker box in the background of the text or a darker frame around the text to amplify the effect.</p>
<h3 id="6-Bounce-to-Zoom-Effect-1"><a href="#6-Bounce-to-Zoom-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Bounce to Zoom Effect"></a>6. Bounce to Zoom Effect</h3><p>The bounce to zoom effect is widely used during a transition from one scene to another. It is regarded as a funny text effect where the text can swipe in and bounce and enlarge in size. Alternatively, the characters can bounce individually and zoom in and out with the motion as if they are dancing.</p>
<p>Apart from transitions, you can use the bounce to zoom effect to showcase a few important texts at the bottom of the video so that the viewers notice your text. Generally, the effect lasts for a few seconds before the text disappears. When you are using it for a larger text, you can use it for promotions and advertisements as well.</p>

Find Out How You Can Do that and Discover an Easier Alternative to DaVinci Resolve</h2><p>Slow-motion videos are in trend on social media platforms. You can shoot the footage in slow-motion mode or slow it down while editing the video. Similarly, if you are making a funny video, there are surely going to be parts where the video speeds up. Sped-up video clips have always been part of comic relief and entertainment for the audience. You will need a feature-rich video editor to customize the speed of your video.</p>
<p>DaVinci Resolve has established itself as a complete video editor. You can edit your video, correct the color, add visual effects and edit audio parts. You can undoubtedly change video speed in DaVinci Resolve. However, DaVinci Resolve’s user interface is slightly complex for beginners. We will instruct on how you can speed up a video using DaVinci Resolve. We will also suggest you an easier alternative if you are not in favor of DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<h2 id="Part-I-What-are-the-Scenarios-When-You-Need-to-Speed-Up-Video"><a href="#Part-I-What-are-the-Scenarios-When-You-Need-to-Speed-Up-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part I. What are the Scenarios When You Need to Speed Up Video?"></a>Part I. What are the Scenarios When You Need to Speed Up Video?</h2><p>There are several scenarios when speeding up a video becomes a necessity. Here are the most probable ones that you can relate to.</p>
<p><strong>Boring But Necessary Parts</strong> - There could be some sections in a long video that are necessary but boring to watch. You can’t bore your viewers and let them leave your video midway. Hence, you can speed up those sections to pass them away quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Funny Videos</strong> - The subject’s actions in the video look very funny when you speed them up. Therefore, if you make funny videos to entertain your viewers, speeding up certain sections of your video with funny audio in the background should be a regular thing.</p>
<p><strong>Short Videos</strong> - Short-duration videos are extremely popular on social media platforms.</p>
<p>People upload them as Stories and Statuses to entertain their followers regularly. Therefore, a sped-up video can shorten the duration, accommodate the necessary content, and fit the video duration requirements of the respective social media platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Timelapse</strong> - Timelapse videos are a treat to watch. You can shoot the video in timelapse mode or speed up the video while editing. That is how you can fit hours of a video into a few minutes or seconds of video duration.</p>

Speed Up Video using DaVinci Resolve</h2><p>DaVinci Resolve is a professional video editor where you can change your video’s speed in several ways. You can instantly change your video clip’s speed by mentioning the speed in terms of percentage.</p>
<p>You can also use the advanced Speed Ramp option to customize the video speed unevenly. Besides, there are retime curves to adjust the video speed at your convenience. Let us go through the detailed guide on how to speed up the video in DaVinci Resolve 17.</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Change-Clip-Speed-Option"><a href="#Method-1-Change-Clip-Speed-Option" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Change Clip Speed Option"></a>Method 1. Change Clip Speed Option</h3><p>The simplest way is through the Change Clip Speed option. You can explicitly mention the speed percentage as needed. To speed it up, mention speed percentage above 100. If you want to slow it down, the speed percentage will be below 100. Here are the steps you need to execute.</p>
<p>Step1 After you have placed the video clip onto the timeline, select the clip and right-click on it.</p>
<p><img

<p>Step2 Tap “Change Clip Speed…” option.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="change clip speed"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Once the Change Clip Speed dialog box opens, modify the speed from 100% to something higher if you want to speed it up.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Step4 Click on the Change button when you are happy with the result.</p>
<h3 id="Method-2-Speed-Ramping-Option"><a href="#Method-2-Speed-Ramping-Option" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Speed Ramping Option"></a>Method 2. Speed Ramping Option</h3><p>Speed ramping is a process where you can vary the speed of your video unevenly. It means you can speed up some portions while slowing down others. This is achieved through retime controls that let you edit the video clips in sections using speed points. Here are the steps to illustrate the process.</p>
<p>Step1 Right-click the video clip on your timeline. From the menu, select the Retime Controls option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Move the play head where you want to change the speed. Click the arrow next to 100% and select the Add Speed Point option. Similarly, move the play head to another point and add a new speed point.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="change the speed"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Click on the arrow next to 100% to change the speed between two-speed points. Go to the Change Speed option and select from the preset. Based on your preset speed selection, the video’s speed within the speed points will change.</p>

                      alt="after adding a miniature effect"
                ></p>
<p>But first, let’s learn the logic of making the miniature effect. As many video editing pros present on Tiktok, the miniature effect is a fun way to brighten up your photography or video shots. For example, when taking a video or a time-lapse of a landscape, we always have a bigger depth of field, so most objects in the frame are in focus.</p>
<p>However, when we film a miniature model, the depth of field is shallow. So, we only see some objects in focus, and the rest is blurry. This visual trick makes our brain believe that the big landscape we’re seeing is actually a tiny model.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="a miniature effect for landscape"
                ></p>
<p>To create a miniature look, we can use specific effects to fake a shallow depth of field, and then the landscape view will look like a tiny model. While some keys to notice before making the miniature effect are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It utilizes <strong>selective blur</strong> to make things appear like <strong>small</strong></li>
<li>The miniature effect works best for footage filmed from <strong>a high angle</strong>.</li>
<li>The tiny effect is usually used in <strong>drone footage, time lapses</strong>, or <strong>landscape photography</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="Step3-Head-to-the-effect-panel"><a href="#Step3-Head-to-the-effect-panel" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Head to the effect panel"></a>Step3 Head to the effect panel</h5><p>As we are working on miniature effects, what do we need first? First, we ensure that we have a <strong>Blur</strong> effect on the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>To add a blur effect from the panel, follow the below-mentioned steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, move toward the above tabs.</li>
<li>Then click on the 5th section, which is <strong>Effect</strong></li>
<li>After selecting the effect tab, a new window will <strong>pop up</strong>.</li>

Again, see how precise it turned out. To add effect, follow below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First, drag</strong> and <strong>Drop</strong> the effect toward the timeline.</li>
<li>Then, make sure to release the effect on the video to give it a lens blur appearance.</li>
</ul>

If you need more blur level in your video and make it more cinematic, then follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, ensure that the <strong>opacity</strong> of the blur effect is 100%.</li>
<li>Then, if you still want more blurriness, add <strong>Blur 2</strong> effect multiple times on the video.</li>
<li>Finally, add effect by just the <strong>Drag and Drop</strong></li>
</ul>

<li>Add it by just the <strong>Drag and Drop</strong></li>
<li>Make sure you add it to 2nd video track in the timeline above the first one.</li>
</ul>

Due to this, we will have a selective blur portion. For this, follow the below guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video present in 2nd track.</li>
<li>The settings tab will be open in the top left section.</li>
<li>Then find the <strong>Mask</strong> section and click on it.</li>
<li>After this, <strong>click</strong> on the <strong>Double-line</strong>.</li>
<li>Set the mask on video according to your style and choice.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add mask to the video on wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> you can adjust the mask size and position by rotating and changing its shape.</p>
<p>Watch the rotating and adjusting actions as shown below!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-10.gif"
                      alt="rotation of mask in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>For example, when we add a mask in the below time-lapse video, follow the above mask adjustments. Unfortunately, we can’t get good results. Therefore, we will apply another way to add a mask by changing shape and position. Follow the instructions for modifications:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-11.gif"
                      alt="blur the object near to camera and focus on the distant object"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Make a building or any object <strong>Blurry</strong> near the camera because it is not present within the depth of field.</li>
<li>While the <strong>object is far</strong> from the camera, it is focused because it is in the depth of the field.</li>
<li>Then adjust the mask, as per your choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Want to change the shape of the mask? Then follow the below steps:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-12.gif"
                      alt="changing the mask of video on wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the video present in 2nd video track.</li>
<li><strong>Settings</strong> will activate on the top left side.</li>
<li>Then click on the <strong>Mask</strong> tab to open it.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Rectangular</strong> mask from the list and apply it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> make sure you are masking the same extent and excluding the object you want to be out of focus.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to mask the whole object, which is far, but we want to make it in focus! For this, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the same stock video clip a <strong>third time</strong> on the third video track of the timeline.</li>
<li>Then add a mask in a <strong>Rectangle</strong> shape on the building.</li>
<li>Don’t <strong>blur</strong> the edge of this mask.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Make a building or any object <strong>Blurry</strong> near the camera because it is not present within the depth of field.</li>
<li>While the <strong>object is far</strong> from the camera, it is focused because it is in the depth of the field.</li>
<li>Then adjust the mask, as per your choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Want to change the shape of the mask? Then follow the below steps:</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> make sure you are masking the same extent and excluding the object you want to be out of focus.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to mask the whole object, which is far, but we want to make it in focus! For this, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the same stock video clip a <strong>third time</strong> on the third video track of the timeline.</li>
<li>Then add a mask in a <strong>Rectangle</strong> shape on the building.</li>
<li>Don’t <strong>blur</strong> the edge of this mask.</li>

Dividing the entire process into a series of individual processes, the aforesaid facility caters to ease out the video creation task.</p>
<p>Moving ahead to draft a technical explanation of storyboards, they are a collection of chronologically arranged drawings, supplemented with video customization elements, such as dialogues, camera direction and other allied detailing. The fundamental merit of these visual arrangements lies in the sequential and scene unfolding of a video footage.</p>
<p>This in turn, works to simplify the film creation process, while ensuring the latter’s cohesiveness and facilitating the elimination of errors and inconsistencies. It is a common mistake to regard storyboards as a midway and optional utility, these trial and error representations are quite essential to ensure a flawless video output in the final stage of design. The facility works additionally to minimize unnecessary production delays, while significantly cutting down on the overall creation cost.</p>
<p>Having a visibility more or less similar to a comic strip, storyboards have a varying scale of design, ranging from being modestly simple to explicitly complex, in cohesion with the specific creation requirements. These visual scripts are mostly hand crafted, through there are a host of storyboard creation software packages and programs available in the IT design market, as well as across the web.</p>

<p><strong>How Can I Get Better at Storyboarding?</strong></p>
<p>Speaking in the light of film production assets and utilities, storyboarding is more of a creative art rather than a customary process or production stage. While it requires consistent effort and practice to master the craft, adhering to some handy tips and tricks can be of great help to improve your skills at creating expressive and finely detailed storyboards.</p>
<p>Heading towards sorting the aforesaid query, the following section presents a concise description of a few amazing and unique storyboard creation guidelines and tricks to present the storyboarding craft at its best:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Stop Aiming to Become a Perfectionist</strong></p>
<p>Considering the fact that you are crafting the storyboard just for the purpose of depicting a sequence of video shots, do not aim at defining every element in comprehensive detail. Instead of making a fresh attempt to depict every minor change, pay more attention towards highlighting the significant points of action within a particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Prefer Numbering the Storyboard Panels</strong></p>
<p>Since the storyboard you are creating works as a blueprint for the video creation team, it should be convenient to understand and navigate through. Presenting the cells of your storyboard in a numbered sequence tends to provide an easy follow through of the same to the rest of your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Explore Your Imagination</strong></p>
<p>Your storyboard happens to be the inaugural representation of your video production idea and script in front of the potential audience. You should hence, proceed with the latter’s crafting process while keeping a close reference with the drafted script. Also, it becomes greatly important to add the imaginative element to your creation to avoid creating an bland and customary impression on the audience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Feedback Has a Great Importance</strong></p>
<p>Make sure to showcase your storyboard to your project investors, prior to beginning with the film creation process. This will aid you with an escape from the unnecessary changes that can pop out from the audience at the last minute, leading to an unwanted financial expense. Pay attention to gather and work on the feedback of the viewers and start the actual creation process only after everything seems to be well settled.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Enjoy Your Work</strong></p>
<p>Enjoying the different aspects of your work is the key to achieve mastery at your craft and a welcoming response from the audience. Accepted that the storyboarding process is mind straining and time consuming, but taking on the challenge with a fun centered attitude will let your hard work shine on in front of the viewers.</p>

<p>When aiming to quickly address the concern of creating storyboards, picking up an online template is a better option in comparison to the traditional pencil and paper drawing. As of working with the web based alternatives, you can add sketches, scripts and notes within the storyboard cells to make them more impressive and detailed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What should be the ideal expanse of a storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule to decide the optimum number of cells or pages for your storyboard. The page count may have variations in line with the content and detailing of the scenes they are crafted to showcase.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Is it essential to include every shot within the storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>On a general note, every shot within your script does not require an inclusion within the storyboard. The answer to this query however, largely depends on the intensity of detailing you wish to add and the diversity of ideas and elements you want to incorporate within the storyboard of a specific film scene.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What are the essentials of a good storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>When attempting to create a good storyboard, pay attention to the fluent transition of the text centered ideas into pictorial representations. Your video script should possess the right quantity of information to make anyone easily understand the content depiction without having a prior walk-through of your script. Abstain from creating an information overflow either, lest you would end up hiding away the relevant details.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What are the major parts of a storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>A well-crafted storyboard comprises of 4 important elements. There are namely, the subject of the shot or scene, a suitable and cohesive background, a properly angled camera shot of the main character within the scene and a responsive camera movement.</p>

<p>There are some video formats that particularly suit certain marketing objectives. Let’s explore some of the most versatile, effective genres with real-world examples:</p>
<h5 id="1-Explainer-Videos-1"><a href="#1-Explainer-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Explainer Videos"></a>1. Explainer Videos</h5><p>Knowing how to simplify and explain complex products, services, or concepts is precisely what Seasoned Explainers do. They use motion graphics, cartoons, live action–it’s all good. They express it interestingly and help audiences understand value offerings they may be unfamiliar with.</p>
<h5 id="2-Tutorial-Videos-1"><a href="#2-Tutorial-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Tutorial Videos"></a>2. Tutorial Videos</h5><p>A good video tutorial leads audiences through a process one can use to employ the product, carry out the method, or develop the skill. Hands-on learning material meets user information needs, indirectly promoting brand owners of the know-how.</p>
<h5 id="3-Behind-the-Scenes-Content-1"><a href="#3-Behind-the-Scenes-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Behind-the-Scenes Content"></a>3. Behind-the-Scenes Content</h5><p>These videos give audiences an insider’s perspective on making popular products.

<p>Creating personalized video marketing strategies that effectively engage your target audience and achieve your marketing goals requires careful planning and execution. You need to grab viewer attention fast, communicate your key messages clearly, and provide strong calls to action.</p>
<p>The key is to keep it concise, optimize for sound-off viewing, build in interactivity, showcase user-generated content, partner with influencers, and more. Apply these best practices for getting your marketing videos noticed and acted upon:</p>
<h5 id="1-Keep-It-Concise-1"><a href="#1-Keep-It-Concise-1" class="headerlink" title="1.Keep It Concise"></a>1.Keep It Concise</h5><p>With a sea of content competing for viewer attention getting longer daily, shorter is better. Videos under 1 minute perform far better for driving clicks, conversions, completes, and shares. Test even 6-second bumper ads on YouTube and Facebook.</p>
<h5 id="2-Capture-Attention-Early-1"><a href="#2-Capture-Attention-Early-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Capture Attention Early"></a>2. Capture Attention Early</h5><p>You have seconds to hook audiences scrolling feeds non-stop. Dynamically edited intros with eye-catching colors, quick cuts, and dramatic questions&#x2F;facts immediately grab interest versus slow fades or titles.</p>
<h5 id="3-Make-Sound-Optional-1"><a href="#3-Make-Sound-Optional-1" class="headerlink" title="3.Make Sound Optional"></a>3.Make Sound Optional</h5><p>85% of videos are now watched without sound on mobile devices. While strong audio is still important for reeled-in viewers, ensure critical info is communicated visually as well.</p>
<h5 id="4-Incorporate-Interactive-Elements-1"><a href="#4-Incorporate-Interactive-Elements-1" class="headerlink" title="4.Incorporate Interactive Elements"></a>4.Incorporate Interactive Elements</h5><p>Leverage platform tools like YouTube cards, info cards, links, hashtags, Q&amp;As and more to keep audiences actively engaged with video content instead of passively viewing.</p>
<h5 id="5-Spotlight-User-Generated-Content-1"><a href="#5-Spotlight-User-Generated-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Spotlight User-Generated Content"></a>5. Spotlight User-Generated Content</h5><p>User videos reviewing products or demonstrating branded tutorials often outperform corporate studio content now. Repurpose this UGC via reaction videos, contest highlights, and “best of” community compilations.</p>
<h5 id="6-Build-Influencer-Partnerships-1"><a href="#6-Build-Influencer-Partnerships-1" class="headerlink" title="6.Build Influencer Partnerships"></a>6.Build Influencer Partnerships</h5><p>Collaborations with influencers popular with your target demos lend video credibility. Support creators with gear, access, co-promotion, etc., in exchange for branded integration and affiliate sales.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence is the replacement of human processes by machines and computer systems. It can replicate intelligent human behaviors, including facial expression recognition, problem-solving, and learning.</p>
<p><strong>AI video interviewing</strong>, an increasingly popular assessment tool driven by artificial intelligence, is being incorporated by many large companies that receive thousands of job applications. AI electronically analyses many aspects of a video interview, including the candidate’s body language, facial expressions, word choices, and tone of voice. It can also track eye movements to determine whether candidates are looking at resources around them.</p>
<p>With the introduction of artificial intelligence, many tech companies and individuals have taken a likeness of it and have grown to utilize it to carry out tasks. Reconsider your position as applicants get selected by assessing their performance in the <strong>AI-based video interview</strong> against a large inventory of facial and linguistic information.</p>

It functions similarly to a face-to-face interview. Candidates get a series of job-specific interview questions, after which they have to record their responses on video with their smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You’ll have a few minutes to answer each question as a candidate before going on to the next. Each exam takes about 20 minutes to complete and can be in any location convenient for you, whether in your living room, a quiet coffee shop nook, or somewhere else.</p>
<p>Each interview follows the same format, ensuring a similar experience for all individuals seeking that particular position.</p>
<p>The algorithm (also known as an assessment model) will assist the recruiter in making a more informed judgment if AI is in the process. It accomplishes this by identifying which candidates are most likely to succeed in the post based on data sets that predict job performance.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Ace-an-AI-video-interview"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Ace-an-AI-video-interview" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Ace an AI video interview."></a>Part 2 <strong>How to Ace an AI video interview.</strong></h2><p>Planning ahead of time might make you feel less anxious and appear more confident, at ease, and relaxed. Here are some ideas for using artificial intelligence in video interviews.</p>
<p>It would help if you first determined whether you are going for an <strong>AI-based video interview,</strong> i.e., if you get an invite to a pre-recorded video interview via a platform. Massive firms are now using this type of interview to interview many possible employees without bias.</p>
<h3 id="01Prepare-for-the-interview-differently"><a href="#01Prepare-for-the-interview-differently" class="headerlink" title="01Prepare for the interview differently."></a>01<strong>Prepare for the interview differently.</strong></h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-1.jpg"
                      alt="Prepare for the
        Interview Differently"
                ></p>
<p>When in an <strong>AI interview</strong>, you need to prepare differently. It’s not the same as a human-to-human interview. There will be no feedback from the person at the other end of the interview. Research the use of <strong>AI in interviews</strong> to know how it works. Remember to research the company in question as well.</p>
<h3 id="02Go-straight-to-the-point"><a href="#02Go-straight-to-the-point" class="headerlink" title="02Go straight to the point."></a>02<strong>Go straight to the point.</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Go Straight to
        the Point"

<p>AI electronically analyzes many features of a video interview. It asks all candidates the same pre-determined questions and then explores how they answered them. Some AI models grade candidates’ responses. Many significant companies use <strong>AI video interviews</strong> or algorithm-based interviewing. Candidates are compared to previous success stories to select the best candidate for the job. The software analyzes the applicant’s performance to the last job for applicants deemed suitable for the position. It compares the inputs to the company’s ideal candidate profile and ranks you accordingly. The AI interviewer will most likely use speech analytics software to break down the candidate’s speech into parts and deduce numerous interpretations. It then uses semantic analytics to determine grammatical proficiency. It also indicates your emotional condition based on the time of your voice.</p>

It’s also more cost-effective and time-saving than hiring a video editor. It allows you to edit more films in a shorter amount of time. It streamlines your job by taking care of most of the burden, making video editing simple even for beginners. AI makes suggestions that the user may not consider, making video production more accessible and engaging. Automating color correction and scene recognition in films improves the visual experience and aids in the formulation of personalized messaging.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence is the replacement of human processes by machines and computer systems. It can replicate intelligent human behaviors, including facial expression recognition, problem-solving, and learning.</p>
<p><strong>AI video interviewing</strong>, an increasingly popular assessment tool driven by artificial intelligence, is being incorporated by many large companies that receive thousands of job applications. AI electronically analyses many aspects of a video interview, including the candidate’s body language, facial expressions, word choices, and tone of voice. It can also track eye movements to determine whether candidates are looking at resources around them.</p>
<p>With the introduction of artificial intelligence, many tech companies and individuals have taken a likeness of it and have grown to utilize it to carry out tasks. Reconsider your position as applicants get selected by assessing their performance in the <strong>AI-based video interview</strong> against a large inventory of facial and linguistic information.</p>

It functions similarly to a face-to-face interview. Candidates get a series of job-specific interview questions, after which they have to record their responses on video with their smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>You’ll have a few minutes to answer each question as a candidate before going on to the next. Each exam takes about 20 minutes to complete and can be in any location convenient for you, whether in your living room, a quiet coffee shop nook, or somewhere else.</p>
<p>Each interview follows the same format, ensuring a similar experience for all individuals seeking that particular position.</p>
<p>The algorithm (also known as an assessment model) will assist the recruiter in making a more informed judgment if AI is in the process. It accomplishes this by identifying which candidates are most likely to succeed in the post based on data sets that predict job performance.</p>

<p>The use of keywords is essential in any job application process. Meanwhile, AI algorithms pick out keywords in a candidate’s response during an interview. Stand out during an <strong>AI interview</strong> by using phrases that explain what you can contribute, echoing the exact language of the job posting. Before the <strong>AI-based video interview</strong>, carefully go through the job description and note what keywords the company uses to describe the role on the company website or job posting page. Be sure to use their words specifically.</p>

<p>AI electronically analyzes many features of a video interview. It asks all candidates the same pre-determined questions and then explores how they answered them. Some AI models grade candidates’ responses. Many significant companies use <strong>AI video interviews</strong> or algorithm-based interviewing. Candidates are compared to previous success stories to select the best candidate for the job. The software analyzes the applicant’s performance to the last job for applicants deemed suitable for the position. It compares the inputs to the company’s ideal candidate profile and ranks you accordingly. The AI interviewer will most likely use speech analytics software to break down the candidate’s speech into parts and deduce numerous interpretations. It then uses semantic analytics to determine grammatical proficiency. It also indicates your emotional condition based on the time of your voice.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence is the replacement of human processes by machines and computer systems. It can replicate intelligent human behaviors, including facial expression recognition, problem-solving, and learning.</p>
<p><strong>AI video interviewing</strong>, an increasingly popular assessment tool driven by artificial intelligence, is being incorporated by many large companies that receive thousands of job applications. AI electronically analyses many aspects of a video interview, including the candidate’s body language, facial expressions, word choices, and tone of voice. It can also track eye movements to determine whether candidates are looking at resources around them.</p>
<p>With the introduction of artificial intelligence, many tech companies and individuals have taken a likeness of it and have grown to utilize it to carry out tasks. Reconsider your position as applicants get selected by assessing their performance in the <strong>AI-based video interview</strong> against a large inventory of facial and linguistic information.</p>

<p>You’ll have a few minutes to answer each question as a candidate before going on to the next. Each exam takes about 20 minutes to complete and can be in any location convenient for you, whether in your living room, a quiet coffee shop nook, or somewhere else.</p>

                ></p>
<p>When in an <strong>AI interview</strong>, you need to prepare differently. It’s not the same as a human-to-human interview. There will be no feedback from the person at the other end of the interview. Research the use of <strong>AI in interviews</strong> to know how it works. Remember to research the company in question as well.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Most <strong>artificial intelligence video interviews</strong> take place through your webcam in the comfort of your home. So, it’s essential to use an appropriate background. Your interview background should be clear of objects and distractions. It should also have enough lighting and be free from background noises since AI algorithms are designed to scan your environment and make deductions about you.</p>

                ></p>
<p>There won’t be a human at the other end of the camera, so there’s no need to dress up, right? That’s wrong. You still need to dress well when attending a formal human job interview. Wear business casuals with plain colored clothes.</p>
<p>Another reason you want to dress professionally is that it can increase your self-confidence, making you relaxed and feel good about yourself.</p>

<p>To ace an <strong>AI interview</strong>, practice in front of a friend or mirror in advance of your interview. You can do a mock interview or record yourself to identify likely mistakes and correct them. Practice by recording yourself and then replaying the video to see where you are making mistakes and need improvement.</p>

<p>Use real-world experiences to showcase your skills when responding to questions during an <strong>AI interview</strong>. To determine and ensure candidates’ suitability, AI looks for specific soft skills like communication, the ability to take the initiative, and lots more. So, talk about them, use a practical example to illustrate your skills, and generally talk about your interview experience.</p>

<p>Wear a pleasant smile as you answer. It is easy to forget to smile when focusing so hard on the questions, but remember to relax and act natural. Facial expressions such as smiling are criteria that <strong>artificial intelligence interviewers</strong> watch for. Remember to smile, nod, and Use Gestures During Your Interview to show that you are attentive.</p>

<p>During an <strong>AI video interview</strong>, maintain eye contact with the camera and gaze squarely into your webcam. Ensure your camera is at eye level, so you don’t have to strain to see into it. Avoid looking away all of the time; this can give the impression of being distracted and unfocused. Speak neutrally or brightly. Remember that the AI analyzes your speech tone and mannerisms. As a result, speaking in clear tones can help you succeed.</p>

You emphasize more confidence when you sit up straight, Sit with an open posture, avoid crossed arms or legs, keep your chin towards your stomach, and do not hunch your shoulders or recline on the chair. Appear in control, natural, and ready to handle any question. Try to keep your talking speed at a conversational rate, and avoid talking too fast or too slow because it might come off as you being nervous or unsure of yourself.</p>

                ></p>
<p>When in an <strong>AI interview</strong>, you need to prepare differently. It’s not the same as a human-to-human interview. There will be no feedback from the person at the other end of the interview. Research the use of <strong>AI in interviews</strong> to know how it works. Remember to research the company in question as well.</p>

<p>Remember that you’re having an interview with a robot and not a human, so skip the small talk and hit the nail on the head. It is better to state your point clearly and straight to the end.</p>

                      alt="Find a Suitable Environment"
                ></p>
<p>Most <strong>artificial intelligence video interviews</strong> take place through your webcam in the comfort of your home. So, it’s essential to use an appropriate background. Your interview background should be clear of objects and distractions. It should also have enough lighting and be free from background noises since AI algorithms are designed to scan your environment and make deductions about you.</p>

                ></p>
<p>There won’t be a human at the other end of the camera, so there’s no need to dress up, right? That’s wrong. You still need to dress well when attending a formal human job interview. Wear business casuals with plain colored clothes.</p>
<p>Another reason you want to dress professionally is that it can increase your self-confidence, making you relaxed and feel good about yourself.</p>

<p>To ace an <strong>AI interview</strong>, practice in front of a friend or mirror in advance of your interview. You can do a mock interview or record yourself to identify likely mistakes and correct them. Practice by recording yourself and then replaying the video to see where you are making mistakes and need improvement.</p>

<p>Use real-world experiences to showcase your skills when responding to questions during an <strong>AI interview</strong>. To determine and ensure candidates’ suitability, AI looks for specific soft skills like communication, the ability to take the initiative, and lots more. So, talk about them, use a practical example to illustrate your skills, and generally talk about your interview experience.</p>

<p>Wear a pleasant smile as you answer. It is easy to forget to smile when focusing so hard on the questions, but remember to relax and act natural.

Remember to smile, nod, and Use Gestures During Your Interview to show that you are attentive.</p>

<p>During an <strong>AI video interview</strong>, maintain eye contact with the camera and gaze squarely into your webcam. Ensure your camera is at eye level, so you don’t have to strain to see into it. Avoid looking away all of the time; this can give the impression of being distracted and unfocused. Speak neutrally or brightly. Remember that the AI analyzes your speech tone and mannerisms. As a result, speaking in clear tones can help you succeed.</p>

You emphasize more confidence when you sit up straight, Sit with an open posture, avoid crossed arms or legs, keep your chin towards your stomach, and do not hunch your shoulders or recline on the chair. Appear in control, natural, and ready to handle any question. Try to keep your talking speed at a conversational rate, and avoid talking too fast or too slow because it might come off as you being nervous or unsure of yourself.</p>

<p>The use of keywords is essential in any job application process. Meanwhile, AI algorithms pick out keywords in a candidate’s response during an interview. Stand out during an <strong>AI interview</strong> by using phrases that explain what you can contribute, echoing the exact language of the job posting. Before the <strong>AI-based video interview</strong>, carefully go through the job description and note what keywords the company uses to describe the role on the company website or job posting page. Be sure to use their words specifically.</p>

<p>AI electronically analyzes many features of a video interview. It asks all candidates the same pre-determined questions and then explores how they answered them. Some AI models grade candidates’ responses. Many significant companies use <strong>AI video interviews</strong> or algorithm-based interviewing. Candidates are compared to previous success stories to select the best candidate for the job. The software analyzes the applicant’s performance to the last job for applicants deemed suitable for the position. It compares the inputs to the company’s ideal candidate profile and ranks you accordingly. The AI interviewer will most likely use speech analytics software to break down the candidate’s speech into parts and deduce numerous interpretations. It then uses semantic analytics to determine grammatical proficiency. It also indicates your emotional condition based on the time of your voice.</p>

It’s also more cost-effective and time-saving than hiring a video editor. It allows you to edit more films in a shorter amount of time. It streamlines your job by taking care of most of the burden, making video editing simple even for beginners. AI makes suggestions that the user may not consider, making video production more accessible and engaging. Automating color correction and scene recognition in films improves the visual experience and aids in the formulation of personalized messaging.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Use-Color-Grading-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Use-Color-Grading-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Color Grading in Final Cut Pro"></a>How to Use Color Grading in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Have you ever questioned the purpose of those odd video scopes or how to build super grades from the start in Final Cut Pro? In contrast to editing talents, color grading is a technical and difficult ability that takes practice.</p>
<p>In order to help, we decided to compile a thorough beginner’s article to color grading in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>With that said, let’s begin!</p>
<h2 id="1-Discover-how-you-color-grade-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#1-Discover-how-you-color-grade-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. Discover how you color grade in Final Cut Pro"></a>1. Discover how you color grade in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Color grading may be a tedious and time-consuming operation, therefore it’s a skill set that calls for a lot of patience. Some editors won’t conduct any color grading or correction beyond the bare minimum. But even mundane-looking film may look remarkable if you know how to give it a dramatic touch.</p>
<p>A more cinematic grade requires a number of procedures, and there is no one method that works for all situations. We’ll therefore walk you through the process of creating a cinematic color grade in Final Cut Pro, but depending on your material, you might need to add or omit some phases.</p>
<h5 id="Step1Filming"><a href="#Step1Filming" class="headerlink" title="Step1Filming"></a>Step1Filming</h5><p>Since the raw video is essential for producing a cinematic image, an outstanding grade begins with the camera.</p>
<p>Use the greatest quality settings your camera offers while recording your video; the more information in your picture, the more you can manipulate it during grading.</p>
<p>While it may seem preferable to shoot with as much color as you can, using a duller color profile is very necessary. Your camera will have color settings, and although the washed-out, drab appearance may not inspire confidence in you, it will offer you a lot more editing possibility.</p>
<h5 id="Step2Create-a-color-profile"><a href="#Step2Create-a-color-profile" class="headerlink" title="Step2Create a color profile"></a>Step2Create a color profile</h5><p>After importing your film, you may be concerned about the general dull look of your recordings. The reason for that is because you have not yet matched the color profile of your sequence to the one of your camera. To start on this process, it goes as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag your clip onto your timeline and make sure it is selected. Click on the Inspector icon.</li>
<li>Then click on the Information tab of the clip.</li>
<li>Navigate all the way down through the options to find the Color LUT option.</li>
<li>Then choose the Color profile that matches your clip based on the camera it is filmed with.</li>
<li>You’re done!</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step3Checking-the-scopes"><a href="#Step3Checking-the-scopes" class="headerlink" title="Step3Checking the scopes"></a>Step3Checking the scopes</h5><p>The Scopes in Final Cut Pro are panels that display the color information of your shots. They are quite complicated and can be difficult to comprehend if you did not use them ever before. You can activate Video Scopes by clicking View &gt; Show in Viewer &gt; Video Scopes from the View menu. The three components of grading are the highlights, mid-tones, and shadows. Your highlights are shown at the top and your shadows are at the bottom in all grading tools and scopes.</p>
<h2 id="2-Include-Color-Wheels"><a href="#2-Include-Color-Wheels" class="headerlink" title="2. Include Color Wheels"></a>2. Include Color Wheels</h2><p>Now that your setup is complete, you can begin grading your footage. Grading is done in multiple layers stacked on top of each other. It may take multiple levels to create the desired look. Follow the instructions below to modify your settings to match your clip if you want to give your footage a cinematic look.</p>
<p>You may access a wider range of color manipulation tools with the built-in color wheels, exposure adjustments, including isolation of color selection, RGB modifications across tone ranges, and simple masking.</p>
<h2 id="3-Color-board"><a href="#3-Color-board" class="headerlink" title="3. Color board"></a>3. Color board</h2><p>A vertical color spectrum is shown on the Color Board, and it is intersected by a horizontal line that features four nodes. These are the ranges of the footage that are designated as the Highlights, Midtones, and Shadows, respectively.</p>
<p>Adjusting a node to a new color space has an immediate and noticeable impact on the corresponding section of the image. If you move above the horizontal line, it will increase, and if you go below the line, it will decrease.</p>
<p>You also have control over the Saturation and Exposure settings. These are wonderful to have if you want to increase the contrast in your photographs and make particular colors more vivid or muted.</p>
<h2 id="4-Masks"><a href="#4-Masks" class="headerlink" title="4. Masks"></a>4. Masks</h2><p>Using the Shape Masks feature, each of these individual effects can be perfect for particular regions of your footage. In addition, by utilizing a Color Mask, you can alter the appearance of a specific color. It is possible to apply multiple iterations of each color adjustment to a clip and find it listed under the Effect heading.</p>
<p>The order can be changed by dragging and dropping, and either method can be disabled or enabled. Utilizing keyframes allows for the effects of color grading to be specifically timed as well. Last but not least, keep in mind that the quality and color sample depth of the clips determine how much of an overall adjustment you are capable of making to a color.</p>
<h2 id="5-Color-Curves"><a href="#5-Color-Curves" class="headerlink" title="5. Color Curves"></a>5. Color Curves</h2><p>If you are experienced with more advanced picture editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop, you will benefit greatly from using color curves. Adjustments can be made independently to both the Luma (the brightest areas) and the primary composite colors (red, blue, and green).</p>
<h2 id="6-Match-Colors"><a href="#6-Match-Colors" class="headerlink" title="6. Match Colors"></a>6. Match Colors</h2><p>Match Color is an additional choice that may be made from the improvement’s menu. This function will try to replicate the visual style of one video clip in another. First, choose the clip whose color you want to change, click on that clip that has the desired appearance, and last, choose Match Color.</p>
<p>You will still be able to utilize these settings as shortcuts even after you have gained more experience with manual grading and are comfortable making finer adjustments manually. It is important to keep in mind that while using Final Cut Pro X for color grading, effects can be layered on top of one another.</p>
<p>It’s not likely that a single tool or adjustment will solve an issue or produce the desired result; rather, it’s more likely that a number of different impacts will be required. In the same way that different visual effects in Final Cut Pro X may be toggled on and off, any layers that you add to a clip can have their visibility controlled from the Inspector window.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In Final Cut Pro X, you may choose from a wide variety of grading plugins, ranging from more affordable solutions like FCPeffects to more expensive ones like Magic Bullet Looks, which are designed specifically for feature film-style grades.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a variety of stand-alone applications for color grading, such as DaVinci Resolve and FilmConvert. You might be comfortable with their gear, but you should also know that their professional-grade color package includes some rather complex editing options.</p>
<p>Beginning to experiment with all of Final Cut Pro X’s functions and determining which ones are most useful to you is the best method to gain an understanding of the program’s color grading capabilities. If you don’t currently have a project that requires your attention, you can download stock footage and experiment with it.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you. If you’re not new to the political scene and have been in office for quite a while, you can make an introduction video that tells your story and what you accomplished.</p>

There are many videos in this format where politicians share their long voting records. However, if you’re new to the scene, the introduction video is the best way to share who you are and what you bring to the table. You can also explain the policy changes you would be implementing and why it matters.</p>
<p>You can spice up your political introduction video with humor and cultural references to appeal to your voters and increase your connection with them.</p>

                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is also quite popular and is an excellent way of gaining the support and loyalty of voters. In a political endorsement video, you can get well-known figures in society to show their support for your cause. Most people use this type of political campaign video to show their credibility and reflect to the voters that they have the support of community leaders.</p>
<p>However, before you make an endorsement video, you need to ensure that your target voters like the figures that are endorsing you. Choosing people they know and love like other political leaders, celebrities, and many others increases the voters’ likelihood of supporting you. A common example of an endorsement video is President Barack Obama’s support for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.</p>
<p><strong>Hold a Question &amp; Answer (Q&amp;A) Section</strong></p>

<p>After you upload the video, you want to ensure that it reaches your target audience and gets the kind of engagement you’re looking for. To ensure this, below are three best practices to promote your political campaign video.</p>
<p><strong>Research and Comply with Government Regulations</strong></p>
<p>Political videos fall into a specific category, and you want to make sure that you follow the rules. There are various regulations, which usually depend on the city, state, or country. Additionally, television advertisements have special rules and social media platforms. Therefore, you should ensure that you follow the rules. For example, although Twitter doesn’t allow for paid political advertisements, Facebook does.</p>
<p><strong>Fact-Check Your Video</strong></p>
<p>You don’t want to mislead your voters; they’re using the video to decide who to vote for. Therefore, you need to ensure that the information you include in your video is accurate. Beyond political reasons, you also have an ethical responsibility to share factual material. You also want to ensure that your video doesn’t include any embarrassing information that can hurt your campaign in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>Promote on Various Platforms</strong></p>
<p>Your target audience is on different platforms, and you need to take the video to them. The legal voting age is eighteen years. Therefore, you should bear this in mind when choosing the right platform to promote your video. Consider sites with politically-engaged voters and ensure you promote your video on such platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Video content is essential for most modern campaigns; you can easily promote it on various social media platforms. For example, you can start with an introductory political video and then host a Q&amp;A session down the line. Ensure you edit your video after filming to ensure it looks optimized and catchy for your audience. By implementing the practices shared in this article, your video should reach your target audience seamlessly.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4 – Select a template for a slideshow</strong></p>
<p>From the template browser given on the left-hand side panel, you can select a template for your slideshow. Before adding anything, do a run-through on your slideshow to see how it looks.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Layout -</strong> You can change the spacing for each slide by unselecting the Link All Box and selecting the ratio which you prefer. Although the program automatically sets the spacing for each slide.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Options –</strong> You can add a frame or you can change the border it allows you to select how your images are going to be displayed in each slide.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Background –</strong> You can add a background to enhance an image, not to divert attention from it. You can add an image as your background or add any colour as your background. You can create background by using various options available.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Music –</strong> You can add music of your choice using an mp3 file.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Transitions -</strong> Setting a transitions between the slides can really make a huge impact on your overall experience. You can use the auto option or you can set the transitions manually.</p>
<p><strong>Step - 6 Completion of slideshow</strong></p>
<p>Once you have made all the desired changes, you can press “Play” option to run the slideshow. If you still want to make any changes you can go back and change whatever you like. Once it’s done and you are happy with the results it’s time to export the slideshow in the form of video or PDF.</p>

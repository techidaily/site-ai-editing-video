<p>Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.</p>
<p>They aren’t exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we’ve put together this guide to take you through the steps. We’ll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you’ve shot it.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video"><a href="#What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Time Lapse Video?"></a>What Is A Time Lapse Video?</h2><p>In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.</p>
<p>When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.</p>
<p>Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?"></a>How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?</h2><h3 id="Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video"></a>Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video</h3><p>Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what’s more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.</p>
<p>When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn’t move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.</p>
<p>Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:</p>
<h4 id="1-Sunset-Sunrise"><a href="#1-Sunset-Sunrise" class="headerlink" title="1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise"></a>1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise</h4><p>These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.</p>
<h4 id="2-Clouds"><a href="#2-Clouds" class="headerlink" title="2. Clouds"></a>2. Clouds</h4><p>Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!</p>
<h4 id="3-Starry-sky"><a href="#3-Starry-sky" class="headerlink" title="3. Starry sky"></a>3. Starry sky</h4><p>Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.</p>
<h4 id="4-Flowers"><a href="#4-Flowers" class="headerlink" title="4. Flowers"></a>4. Flowers</h4><p>Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!</p>
<h4 id="5-Season-changing"><a href="#5-Season-changing" class="headerlink" title="5. Season changing"></a>5. Season changing</h4><p>The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don’t have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.</p>
<h4 id="6-Cars-or-Pedestrians"><a href="#6-Cars-or-Pedestrians" class="headerlink" title="6. Cars or Pedestrians"></a>6. Cars or Pedestrians</h4><p>If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.</p>
<h4 id="7-Cooking-dinner"><a href="#7-Cooking-dinner" class="headerlink" title="7. Cooking dinner"></a>7. Cooking dinner</h4><p>Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It’s easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!</p>
<h4 id="8-DIY-projects"><a href="#8-DIY-projects" class="headerlink" title="8. DIY projects"></a>8. DIY projects</h4><p>Are you building something? Whether it’s a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.</p>
<h4 id="9-Construction-work-in-progress"><a href="#9-Construction-work-in-progress" class="headerlink" title="9. Construction work in progress"></a>9. Construction work in progress</h4><p>If you’re watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It’s hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it’s finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.</p>
<h4 id="10-A-fun-art-project"><a href="#10-A-fun-art-project" class="headerlink" title="10. A fun art project"></a>10. A fun art project</h4><p>Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Steps to shoot a time-lapse video"></a>Steps to shoot a time-lapse video</h3><p>Time-lapse videography is something that most photographers and videographers are familiar with. But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.</p>
<p>If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.</p>
<h4 id="1-Decide-on-a-subject"><a href="#1-Decide-on-a-subject" class="headerlink" title="1. Decide on a subject"></a>1. Decide on a subject</h4><p>The movement of clouds, a sunrise or sunset, waves crashing at the beach, cars coming and going in your parking lot, people walking around your office building — all of these subjects can yield great time-lapse sequences.</p>
<h4 id="2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod"><a href="#2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod" class="headerlink" title="2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod"></a>2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod</h4><p>While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.</p>
<p><em>Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don’t want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots.</em></p>
<h4 id="3-Set-the-camera-focus"><a href="#3-Set-the-camera-focus" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the camera focus"></a>3. Set the camera focus</h4><p>Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Set-your-exposure-settings"><a href="#4-Set-your-exposure-settings" class="headerlink" title="4. Set your exposure settings"></a>4. Set your exposure settings</h4><p>Depending on how much the light is going to change over time, you may want to use aperture priority or shutter priority so that the camera will automatically adjust for changes in light. Or, if you know exactly how much light will be changing over time, you could set all exposure settings manually.</p>
<h4 id="5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed"><a href="#5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed" class="headerlink" title="5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed"></a>5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed</h4><p>For example, if you are shooting at 10 frames per second and want a total of 30 seconds of video at 24 fps (which is standard), you will need 720 frames&#x2F;photos (30 seconds x 24 fps &#x3D; 720 frames).</p>
<h4 id="6-Import-and-stitch-together"><a href="#6-Import-and-stitch-together" class="headerlink" title="6. Import and stitch together"></a>6. Import and stitch together</h4><p>Once you’ve captured the images, import them into a video editing software, stitch them together, and perform necessary editing.</p>

That’s where Wondershare Filmora comes into play.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.</p>
<p>If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.</p>
<p>Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.</p>
<h3 id="Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Speed up your time-lapse video"></a>Speed up your time-lapse video</h3><p>Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.</p>
<p>When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.</p>
<p>Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.</li>
<li>Launch Filmora and click the <strong>New project</strong> button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Slow down your time-lapse video"></a>Slow down your time-lapse video</h3><p>As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.</p>
<p>You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the <strong>Fast</strong> option choose <strong>Slow</strong> when you’re at step 4.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It’s easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.</p>
<p>Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don’t be afraid to create something unique and experimental.</p>

<p>Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.</p>
<p>They aren’t exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we’ve put together this guide to take you through the steps. We’ll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you’ve shot it.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-1"><a href="#What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Time Lapse Video?"></a>What Is A Time Lapse Video?</h2><p>In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.</p>
<p>When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.</p>
<p>Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-1"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?"></a>How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?</h2><h3 id="Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-1"><a href="#Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video"></a>Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video</h3><p>Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what’s more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.</p>
<p>When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn’t move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.</p>
<p>Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:</p>
<h4 id="1-Sunset-Sunrise-1"><a href="#1-Sunset-Sunrise-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise"></a>1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise</h4><p>These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.</p>
<h4 id="2-Clouds-1"><a href="#2-Clouds-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Clouds"></a>2. Clouds</h4><p>Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!</p>
<h4 id="3-Starry-sky-1"><a href="#3-Starry-sky-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Starry sky"></a>3. Starry sky</h4><p>Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.</p>
<h4 id="4-Flowers-1"><a href="#4-Flowers-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Flowers"></a>4. Flowers</h4><p>Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!</p>
<h4 id="5-Season-changing-1"><a href="#5-Season-changing-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Season changing"></a>5. Season changing</h4><p>The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don’t have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.</p>
<h4 id="6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-1"><a href="#6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Cars or Pedestrians"></a>6. Cars or Pedestrians</h4><p>If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.</p>
<h4 id="7-Cooking-dinner-1"><a href="#7-Cooking-dinner-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Cooking dinner"></a>7. Cooking dinner</h4><p>Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It’s easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!</p>
<h4 id="8-DIY-projects-1"><a href="#8-DIY-projects-1" class="headerlink" title="8. DIY projects"></a>8. DIY projects</h4><p>Are you building something? Whether it’s a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.</p>
<h4 id="9-Construction-work-in-progress-1"><a href="#9-Construction-work-in-progress-1" class="headerlink" title="9. Construction work in progress"></a>9. Construction work in progress</h4><p>If you’re watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It’s hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it’s finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.</p>
<h4 id="10-A-fun-art-project-1"><a href="#10-A-fun-art-project-1" class="headerlink" title="10. A fun art project"></a>10. A fun art project</h4><p>Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-1"><a href="#Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Steps to shoot a time-lapse video"></a>Steps to shoot a time-lapse video</h3><p>Time-lapse videography is something that most photographers and videographers are familiar with. But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.</p>
<p>If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.</p>
<h4 id="1-Decide-on-a-subject-1"><a href="#1-Decide-on-a-subject-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Decide on a subject"></a>1. Decide on a subject</h4><p>The movement of clouds, a sunrise or sunset, waves crashing at the beach, cars coming and going in your parking lot, people walking around your office building — all of these subjects can yield great time-lapse sequences.</p>
<h4 id="2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-1"><a href="#2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod"></a>2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod</h4><p>While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.</p>
<p><em>Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don’t want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots.</em></p>
<h4 id="3-Set-the-camera-focus-1"><a href="#3-Set-the-camera-focus-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the camera focus"></a>3. Set the camera focus</h4><p>Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Set-your-exposure-settings-1"><a href="#4-Set-your-exposure-settings-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Set your exposure settings"></a>4. Set your exposure settings</h4><p>Depending on how much the light is going to change over time, you may want to use aperture priority or shutter priority so that the camera will automatically adjust for changes in light. Or, if you know exactly how much light will be changing over time, you could set all exposure settings manually.</p>
<h4 id="5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed-1"><a href="#5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed"></a>5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed</h4><p>For example, if you are shooting at 10 frames per second and want a total of 30 seconds of video at 24 fps (which is standard), you will need 720 frames&#x2F;photos (30 seconds x 24 fps &#x3D; 720 frames).</p>

That’s where Wondershare Filmora comes into play.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.</p>
<p>If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.</p>
<p>Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.</p>
<h3 id="Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-1"><a href="#Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Speed up your time-lapse video"></a>Speed up your time-lapse video</h3><p>Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.</p>
<p>When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.</p>
<p>Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.</li>
<li>Launch Filmora and click the <strong>New project</strong> button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-1"><a href="#Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Slow down your time-lapse video"></a>Slow down your time-lapse video</h3><p>As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.</p>
<p>You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the <strong>Fast</strong> option choose <strong>Slow</strong> when you’re at step 4.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It’s easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.</p>
<p>Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don’t be afraid to create something unique and experimental.</p>

<p>Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.</p>
<p>They aren’t exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we’ve put together this guide to take you through the steps. We’ll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you’ve shot it.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-2"><a href="#What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Time Lapse Video?"></a>What Is A Time Lapse Video?</h2><p>In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.</p>
<p>When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.</p>
<p>Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-2"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?"></a>How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?</h2><h3 id="Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-2"><a href="#Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-2" class="headerlink" title="Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video"></a>Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video</h3><p>Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what’s more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.</p>
<p>When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn’t move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.</p>
<p>Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:</p>
<h4 id="1-Sunset-Sunrise-2"><a href="#1-Sunset-Sunrise-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise"></a>1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise</h4><p>These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.</p>
<h4 id="2-Clouds-2"><a href="#2-Clouds-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Clouds"></a>2. Clouds</h4><p>Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!</p>
<h4 id="3-Starry-sky-2"><a href="#3-Starry-sky-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Starry sky"></a>3. Starry sky</h4><p>Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.</p>
<h4 id="4-Flowers-2"><a href="#4-Flowers-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Flowers"></a>4. Flowers</h4><p>Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!</p>
<h4 id="5-Season-changing-2"><a href="#5-Season-changing-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Season changing"></a>5. Season changing</h4><p>The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don’t have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.</p>
<h4 id="6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-2"><a href="#6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Cars or Pedestrians"></a>6. Cars or Pedestrians</h4><p>If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.</p>
<h4 id="7-Cooking-dinner-2"><a href="#7-Cooking-dinner-2" class="headerlink" title="7. Cooking dinner"></a>7. Cooking dinner</h4><p>Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It’s easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!</p>
<h4 id="8-DIY-projects-2"><a href="#8-DIY-projects-2" class="headerlink" title="8. DIY projects"></a>8. DIY projects</h4><p>Are you building something? Whether it’s a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.</p>
<h4 id="9-Construction-work-in-progress-2"><a href="#9-Construction-work-in-progress-2" class="headerlink" title="9. Construction work in progress"></a>9. Construction work in progress</h4><p>If you’re watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It’s hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it’s finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.</p>
<h4 id="10-A-fun-art-project-2"><a href="#10-A-fun-art-project-2" class="headerlink" title="10. A fun art project"></a>10. A fun art project</h4><p>Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-2"><a href="#Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-2" class="headerlink" title="Steps to shoot a time-lapse video"></a>Steps to shoot a time-lapse video</h3><p>Time-lapse videography is something that most photographers and videographers are familiar with. But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.</p>
<p>If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.</p>
<h4 id="1-Decide-on-a-subject-2"><a href="#1-Decide-on-a-subject-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Decide on a subject"></a>1. Decide on a subject</h4><p>The movement of clouds, a sunrise or sunset, waves crashing at the beach, cars coming and going in your parking lot, people walking around your office building — all of these subjects can yield great time-lapse sequences.</p>
<h4 id="2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-2"><a href="#2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod"></a>2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod</h4><p>While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.</p>
<p><em>Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don’t want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots.</em></p>
<h4 id="3-Set-the-camera-focus-2"><a href="#3-Set-the-camera-focus-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the camera focus"></a>3. Set the camera focus</h4><p>Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Set-your-exposure-settings-2"><a href="#4-Set-your-exposure-settings-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Set your exposure settings"></a>4. Set your exposure settings</h4><p>Depending on how much the light is going to change over time, you may want to use aperture priority or shutter priority so that the camera will automatically adjust for changes in light. Or, if you know exactly how much light will be changing over time, you could set all exposure settings manually.</p>
<h4 id="5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed-2"><a href="#5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed"></a>5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed</h4><p>For example, if you are shooting at 10 frames per second and want a total of 30 seconds of video at 24 fps (which is standard), you will need 720 frames&#x2F;photos (30 seconds x 24 fps &#x3D; 720 frames).</p>

<p>Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.</p>
<p>If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.</p>
<p>Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.</p>
<h3 id="Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-2"><a href="#Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-2" class="headerlink" title="Speed up your time-lapse video"></a>Speed up your time-lapse video</h3><p>Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.</p>
<p>When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.</p>
<p>Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.</li>
<li>Launch Filmora and click the <strong>New project</strong> button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-2"><a href="#Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-2" class="headerlink" title="Slow down your time-lapse video"></a>Slow down your time-lapse video</h3><p>As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.</p>
<p>You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the <strong>Fast</strong> option choose <strong>Slow</strong> when you’re at step 4.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It’s easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.</p>

<p>Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.</p>
<p>They aren’t exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we’ve put together this guide to take you through the steps. We’ll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you’ve shot it.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-3"><a href="#What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Time Lapse Video?"></a>What Is A Time Lapse Video?</h2><p>In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.</p>
<p>When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.</p>
<p>Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-3"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?"></a>How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?</h2><h3 id="Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-3"><a href="#Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video"></a>Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video</h3><p>Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what’s more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.</p>
<p>When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn’t move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.</p>
<p>Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:</p>
<h4 id="1-Sunset-Sunrise-3"><a href="#1-Sunset-Sunrise-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise"></a>1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise</h4><p>These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.</p>
<h4 id="2-Clouds-3"><a href="#2-Clouds-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Clouds"></a>2. Clouds</h4><p>Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!</p>
<h4 id="3-Starry-sky-3"><a href="#3-Starry-sky-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Starry sky"></a>3. Starry sky</h4><p>Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.</p>
<h4 id="4-Flowers-3"><a href="#4-Flowers-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Flowers"></a>4. Flowers</h4><p>Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!</p>
<h4 id="5-Season-changing-3"><a href="#5-Season-changing-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Season changing"></a>5. Season changing</h4><p>The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don’t have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.</p>
<h4 id="6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-3"><a href="#6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Cars or Pedestrians"></a>6. Cars or Pedestrians</h4><p>If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.</p>
<h4 id="7-Cooking-dinner-3"><a href="#7-Cooking-dinner-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Cooking dinner"></a>7. Cooking dinner</h4><p>Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It’s easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!</p>
<h4 id="8-DIY-projects-3"><a href="#8-DIY-projects-3" class="headerlink" title="8. DIY projects"></a>8. DIY projects</h4><p>Are you building something? Whether it’s a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.</p>
<h4 id="9-Construction-work-in-progress-3"><a href="#9-Construction-work-in-progress-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Construction work in progress"></a>9. Construction work in progress</h4><p>If you’re watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It’s hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it’s finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.</p>
<h4 id="10-A-fun-art-project-3"><a href="#10-A-fun-art-project-3" class="headerlink" title="10. A fun art project"></a>10. A fun art project</h4><p>Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-3"><a href="#Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to shoot a time-lapse video"></a>Steps to shoot a time-lapse video</h3><p>Time-lapse videography is something that most photographers and videographers are familiar with. But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.</p>
<p>If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.</p>
<h4 id="1-Decide-on-a-subject-3"><a href="#1-Decide-on-a-subject-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Decide on a subject"></a>1. Decide on a subject</h4><p>The movement of clouds, a sunrise or sunset, waves crashing at the beach, cars coming and going in your parking lot, people walking around your office building — all of these subjects can yield great time-lapse sequences.</p>
<h4 id="2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-3"><a href="#2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod"></a>2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod</h4><p>While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.</p>
<p><em>Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don’t want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots.</em></p>
<h4 id="3-Set-the-camera-focus-3"><a href="#3-Set-the-camera-focus-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the camera focus"></a>3. Set the camera focus</h4><p>Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Set-your-exposure-settings-3"><a href="#4-Set-your-exposure-settings-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Set your exposure settings"></a>4. Set your exposure settings</h4><p>Depending on how much the light is going to change over time, you may want to use aperture priority or shutter priority so that the camera will automatically adjust for changes in light. Or, if you know exactly how much light will be changing over time, you could set all exposure settings manually.</p>
<h4 id="5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed-3"><a href="#5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed"></a>5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed</h4><p>For example, if you are shooting at 10 frames per second and want a total of 30 seconds of video at 24 fps (which is standard), you will need 720 frames&#x2F;photos (30 seconds x 24 fps &#x3D; 720 frames).</p>

<p>When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.</p>
<p>Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.</li>
<li>Launch Filmora and click the <strong>New project</strong> button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>

</ul>

                      alt="drag the media file to the timeline"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Click the <strong>Speed</strong> icon and select the <strong>Fast</strong> option. Select 2x, 4x, 8x, etc, depending on how much you want to speed up.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-3"><a href="#Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Slow down your time-lapse video"></a>Slow down your time-lapse video</h3><p>As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.</p>
<p>You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the <strong>Fast</strong> option choose <strong>Slow</strong> when you’re at step 4.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It’s easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.</p>
<p>Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don’t be afraid to create something unique and experimental.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Denoise-in-Final-Cut-Pro-–-Reduce-Video-and-Audio-Noise"><a href="#How-to-Denoise-in-Final-Cut-Pro-–-Reduce-Video-and-Audio-Noise" class="headerlink" title="How to Denoise in Final Cut Pro – Reduce Video and Audio Noise"></a>How to Denoise in Final Cut Pro – Reduce Video and Audio Noise</h2><p>Whenever it comes to the term denoise, we usually get kind of “lost in translation” – does it mean to remove or reduce just the background noise in terms of audio, or does it intend noise effect on the actual scene which we see visually? Anyway, using video editors, denoising is possible in both ways. And why should we denoise at all? – to find out, we will touch upon both issues, and learn how to do those two things in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><strong>How to remove background noise in Final Cut Pro?</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t really matter if you are preparing a video for youtube, a podcast, or any other content with audio in it – for your listeners to be engaged, you need a clear audio, but sometimes that is not the case. You might even find unnecessary background noise after recording the video or audio, and it can be really annoying – that kind of recording gives your audio tracks an unprofessional touch, which can lead to disengaged listeners, the viewers who just don’t want to listen to it anymore. But it’s always possible to turn the tables – and for it, using video editors might really give us a hand. So, Final Cut Pro, which is developed only for Macs (so, you will not be able to use this software on the PC), can solve this problem for you.</p>
<p>So, if you are using Final Cut Pro 10.6, it’s possible to achieve your goal without using any plug-ins. In such a case, there are special effects to use. First of all, let us say that you have an audio file which you want to be corrected because it has some echo, hum, background noise; so you import that one into the programme, namely, timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="denoise-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>You will need to first use Equalatization, which is under the Audio Enhancements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-2.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>You will need to check the square that opens the equalizer and shows graphics for it. The high frequencies are on the right, and the low ones you will find on the left. Lower the highs and raise the points a little on the left side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-3.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Next step would be to level out the lows and highs of the voice using a Compressor. You will find this effect in Installed Effects, which you need to drag and drop on the audio, and it will raise the whispers and lower the shouts in the audio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-4.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Some background noise will still be there, so you then can find Channel EQ effect you will find in the effects. You need to drag it on the clip, then click on the equalize button in the inspector, and this time, reduce the lower levels on the left, while you also lower the highs on the right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-5.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Lastly, you will need to use the Noise Gate effect. This will cut out all of the sounds between words, so when someone in the audio is not speaking, there will be no background noise at all.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-6.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>In case this kind of cutting noise out doesn’t sound natural, you can look into Noise Gate Parameters and concentrate on two of them – reduction and release. If you drag the latter right, the noise will raise, and reduction will also raise noise a little, in order to reduce the clipping.</p>
<p><strong>How to denoise a video in Final Cut Pro?</strong></p>
<p>But what is noise in terms of videos? It means that the video is not clear, but instead, the clip has grains on it, which is not so pleasant to see (unless you use noise&#x2F;grain effect with some purpose!). the noise usually appear when the shot was taken in an environment with not enough white, or, in other cases, when the video was taken with small-sensory equipment, for example, smartphone or action camera.</p>
<p>And Final Cut Pro is one of the video editors where you can remove or reduce the noise and make your footage look clearer than it would have been originally, and it will guarantee that people who are interested and watch your clip will have a better experience. So, let’s learn step by step how to denoise the video in our beloved Final Cut Pro, which added this feature only starting from Final Cut Pro 10.4.4 – it means that before, the task was only done by using some expensive plug-ins, but starting from this version of the program, the software has video noise reduction effect itself.</p>
<p>So, choose the video which has some noise and grain and you wish to edit. Bring it in the program, and click on it in the timeline, in order to select it. The video should appear in the viewer, and you will be able to see the noise right away or whenever you zoom in a little. Then, you will need to find the Effects – you can just use the shortcut and click on Command and 5, or find the panel in the top-right corner of the timeline. Whenever Effects appear, you will need to select the Basic category, and then double-click the icon to apply the noise reduction filter, and close the window. It might take a while to analyze the clip for noise.</p>

                      alt="denoise-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>In the inspector, you will find the controls for noise reduction, which only include the Amount and Sharpness.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-9.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>You might as well boost the amount to high, then you can take a look at the image to evaluate the result. One way to do the last step is to uncheck the box next to the Noise Reduction as well, which will disable the filter until you check the box again.</p>
<p>You can also change the Sharpness to Medium, which will compensate for the soft look the effect produces.</p>
<p>And, there is also a noise reduction effect dedicated to 360 viewers, which is called 360 Noise Reduction. As you can see, the effect removes a lot of noise and makes the grainy video look clearer and more enjoyable, besides, if you move around the sphere in the viewer, the effect seems quite seamless!</p>

<p>First off, of course, you need to drag and drop the video into the timeline. Then, in order to edit the audio of the video separately, you’ll need to right-click on the video and find Detach Audio.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Double-clicking on the audio track in the sequence will show the editing panel, where you can find – Remove background noise, which, as it is obvious, will remove the noise directly.</p>

                ></p>
<p>So, in this article, we learned how to denoise in Final Cut Pro – both in terms of audio background noise, and noise and grain on the video, and we learned how to get rid of audio noise in Wondershare Filmora in the easiest and fastest way!</p>
<p>You will need to first use Equalatization, which is under the Audio Enhancements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-2.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>You will need to check the square that opens the equalizer and shows graphics for it. The high frequencies are on the right, and the low ones you will find on the left. Lower the highs and raise the points a little on the left side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-3.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Next step would be to level out the lows and highs of the voice using a Compressor. You will find this effect in Installed Effects, which you need to drag and drop on the audio, and it will raise the whispers and lower the shouts in the audio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-4.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Some background noise will still be there, so you then can find Channel EQ effect you will find in the effects. You need to drag it on the clip, then click on the equalize button in the inspector, and this time, reduce the lower levels on the left, while you also lower the highs on the right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-5.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Lastly, you will need to use the Noise Gate effect. This will cut out all of the sounds between words, so when someone in the audio is not speaking, there will be no background noise at all.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-6.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>In case this kind of cutting noise out doesn’t sound natural, you can look into Noise Gate Parameters and concentrate on two of them – reduction and release. If you drag the latter right, the noise will raise, and reduction will also raise noise a little, in order to reduce the clipping.</p>
<p><strong>How to denoise a video in Final Cut Pro?</strong></p>
<p>But what is noise in terms of videos? It means that the video is not clear, but instead, the clip has grains on it, which is not so pleasant to see (unless you use noise&#x2F;grain effect with some purpose!). the noise usually appear when the shot was taken in an environment with not enough white, or, in other cases, when the video was taken with small-sensory equipment, for example, smartphone or action camera.</p>
<p>And Final Cut Pro is one of the video editors where you can remove or reduce the noise and make your footage look clearer than it would have been originally, and it will guarantee that people who are interested and watch your clip will have a better experience. So, let’s learn step by step how to denoise the video in our beloved Final Cut Pro, which added this feature only starting from Final Cut Pro 10.4.4 – it means that before, the task was only done by using some expensive plug-ins, but starting from this version of the program, the software has video noise reduction effect itself.</p>
<p>So, choose the video which has some noise and grain and you wish to edit. Bring it in the program, and click on it in the timeline, in order to select it. The video should appear in the viewer, and you will be able to see the noise right away or whenever you zoom in a little. Then, you will need to find the Effects – you can just use the shortcut and click on Command and 5, or find the panel in the top-right corner of the timeline. Whenever Effects appear, you will need to select the Basic category, and then double-click the icon to apply the noise reduction filter, and close the window. It might take a while to analyze the clip for noise.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-7.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-8.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>In the inspector, you will find the controls for noise reduction, which only include the Amount and Sharpness.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-9.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>You might as well boost the amount to high, then you can take a look at the image to evaluate the result. One way to do the last step is to uncheck the box next to the Noise Reduction as well, which will disable the filter until you check the box again.</p>
<p>You can also change the Sharpness to Medium, which will compensate for the soft look the effect produces.</p>
<p>And, there is also a noise reduction effect dedicated to 360 viewers, which is called 360 Noise Reduction. As you can see, the effect removes a lot of noise and makes the grainy video look clearer and more enjoyable, besides, if you move around the sphere in the viewer, the effect seems quite seamless!</p>

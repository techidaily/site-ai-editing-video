<p>You may change the threshold or sensitivity to make it work for you. The sensitivity level determines the size of the pause. Thus, a lower sensitivity level records longer pauses. You can fine-tune three crucial Filmora Silence Detection settings in this step.</p>
<p>First, you should adjust the volume threshold to fix a specific value for silence. This parameter tells the algorithm how loud you want it to be before it becomes annoying. By default, 25% is the volume threshold. It implies that the software will consider segments silent if their volume threshold value is less than 25%.</p>
<p> Now, you should adjust the Minimum Duration option. It tells Filmora how long a period of quiet or low-volume sound should be. Just 0.5 seconds is the default minimum duration. In other words, for 0.5 seconds to be considered quiet, there must be no sound.</p>
<p> You can also set the Softening Buffer value. This setting allows you to add a little delay before and after audible parts begin and finish. With 0.1s set as the default, the softening buffer starts to work. It implies that the beginning and end of the audible parts may each have their own 0.1-second buffering time.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Hit the “Analyze” button after you’re happy with the settings. The Filmora will detect and remove the silent areas in your audio track.</p>
<p>The software also highlights segments in two different colors. Seen in black are the portions that do not contain any sound. The highlighted sections indicate the audible portions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create these target directories in your Adobe Premiere Installation files. • For shared devices<br>&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Adobe&#x2F;Common&#x2F;LUTs&#x2F;Creative<br>&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Adobe&#x2F;Common&#x2F;LUTs&#x2F;Technical<br>• You need to create these files if you have administrator access.<br>&#x2F;Users&#x2F;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Adobe&#x2F;Common&#x2F;LUTs&#x2F;Creative<br>&#x2F;Users&#x2F;&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Adobe&#x2F;Common&#x2F;LUTs&#x2F;Technical</li>
<li>Copy your custom LUT files to each of the folders.</li>
<li>These will be available in your Lumetri Panel next time you launch Adobe Premiere Pro.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>For shared devices:<br>C:\ Program Files\ Adobe\Common\LUTs\Creative<br>C:\ Program Files\ Adobe\Common\LUTs\Creative</li>

<ol>
<li>Follow the above process through to step 5.</li>
<li>Once you finish your editing, click on the Lumetri Pop Up menu and choose Save Preset.</li>
<li>Fill the respective fields with your custom information and click OK. The program will then save the clip to the location you specify.</li>
<li>You can save custom luts in the following ways:<br>Scale only applies the new lut to the video. As such, all other luts you use are deleted. Therefore, if your video is one hour, your custom settings will run through the clip’s entire length.<br>Anchor To In Point only saves the section of the clip where your custom settings are active. Additionally, the software will add all pre-existing luts to the section without scaling.</li>
<li>Additionally, you can repeat the process and export your LUTs in the following formats:<br>.look exports the LUT as an Adobe Premiere Pro file to a location on your device.<br>.cube saves the Lumetri preset you can use on other color grading software. For example, you can use your .cube custom lut with Filmora.</li>

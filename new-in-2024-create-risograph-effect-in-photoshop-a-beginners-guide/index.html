<p>If you’re a novice graphic designer or illustrator, you’ve probably seen Risograph prints and wondered how they are made. Well, this article will help you <strong>create a risograph effect in Photoshop</strong> quickly!</p>
<p>Without further delay, let’s get started with our step-by-step tutorial!</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Risograph-Effect"><a href="#What-Is-Risograph-Effect" class="headerlink" title="What Is Risograph Effect?"></a>What Is Risograph Effect?</h2><p>Before we look into how to create a risograph effect in Photoshop <a href="#_How_To_Use">in the later part of this article</a>, let’s have a basic understanding of Risograph.</p>
<p>Risograph was created in <strong>1986</strong> by a Japanese company called <strong>Riso Kagaku Corporation.</strong> It’s a form of stencil printing, a technique that uses a stencil to create an image on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>The Risograph machine prints images by building them up one layer at a time, with each subsequent layer being a different color. Because of this, each print produced is imperfect, though some artists believe this only adds to the Risograph’s unique charm and distinct look.</p>
<p>The Risograph printing effect gives images a vibrant and bold look, making them perfect for ads, magazines, and abstract artworks. The printing method is also used for many products, including books, fabric, magazines, newspapers, plastic, metal, and even some forms of packaging.</p>
<h2 id="How-To-Use-Photoshop-To-Create-Risograph-Effect"><a href="#How-To-Use-Photoshop-To-Create-Risograph-Effect" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Photoshop To Create Risograph Effect"></a>How To Use Photoshop To Create Risograph Effect</h2><p>The tutorial will be divided into three parts to help you master the risograph effect-creating skills to give your design project a distinct look.</p>
<p>Firstly, we will focus on how to use Photoshop in the following way to create the primary risograph effect.</p>
<h3 id="How-To-Create-the-Basic-Risograph-Effect-in-Photoshop"><a href="#How-To-Create-the-Basic-Risograph-Effect-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="How To Create the Basic Risograph Effect in Photoshop"></a>How To Create the Basic Risograph Effect in Photoshop</h3><p>Step1 Launch <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/"><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong></a> on your laptop&#x2F;desktop (For this tutorial, we are using Photoshop CC 2021). Click <strong>“Create New,”</strong> select the document size, and click <strong>“Create.”</strong> Now set a paper-like textured layer on the canvas. Click <strong>“Ctrl + Shift + N,”</strong> and in the new layer window, set the mode to <strong>“Multiply.”</strong> Click <strong>“OK.”</strong> to confirm your action.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adding-new-layer-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png"
                      alt="adding new layer to create risograph effect in photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Next, press <strong>“Ctrl+Shift+E”</strong> to combine your layers and select the <strong>“Edit”</strong> option from the top toolbar. Scroll down and select <strong>“Define Pattern.”</strong> Set the pattern name and click <strong>“OK.”</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/defining-pattern-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png"
                      alt="select edit option"
                ></p>
<p>Click <strong>“Layer”</strong> from the toolbar and choose <strong>“New Fill Layer”&gt; “Pattern.”</strong> Next, select your new pattern layer and click <strong>“OK”</strong> to get a grid layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/applying-grid-pattern-to-object-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png"
                      alt="choose new fill layer"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Let’s place an object&#x2F;subject onto our canvas. Set the issue to “<strong>Multiply</strong>,” right-click on it and choose “<strong>Convert to Smart Object</strong>.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/converting-main-object-to-smart-object-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png"
                      alt="choose convert to smart object"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 To add a Gradient Map Layer, click <strong>“Layer,”</strong> scroll down and click <strong>“New Adjustment Layer.”</strong> Select <strong>“Gradient Map…”</strong> from the drop-down menu and click <strong>“OK”</strong> to confirm.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/selecting-gradient-map-from-layer-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png"
                      alt="click layer"
                ></p>
<p>Use the <strong>“Properties”</strong> panel and select the <strong>“gradient”</strong> colors. Here we’ve chosen shades of <strong>“White”</strong> and <strong>“Red.”</strong> Click <strong>“OK”</strong> to apply.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/applying-gradient-map-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png"
                      alt="select the gradient color"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 For the image to have less contrast, click <strong>“Image”</strong> in the top toolbar and click <strong>“Adjustments.”</strong> Select <strong>“Levels…”</strong> from the menu. Now, set the black output to <strong>73.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/applying-adjustment-level-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png"
                      alt="click image"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, click <strong>“Filter”</strong> and open the <strong>“Filter Gallery.”</strong> Select <strong>“Sketch” &gt; “Torn Edge,”</strong> set Image balance to <strong>30,</strong> smoothness, and contrast to <strong>15, 15</strong> respectively. Click <strong>“OK”</strong> to apply the changes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

The method was initially limited to high-end lenses, but super slo-mo has become increasingly superior as smartphone technology advances.</p>
<p>Super slo-mo is a terrific technique to learn how to use if you want to accentuate a dramatic moment or extend the humiliation of a friend you captured in an embarrassing scenario. This article has stepwise guides and tips for recording super slo-mo on your phone. Let’s get going!</p>

<p>Super Slow-mo movie may be displayed as 6-12 sec long on old smartphones, such as Galaxy S9&#x2F;S9+ and Note9. However, the newer versions, such as Galaxy S10 Series, can play super slow-mo movies up to 14.8 sec.</p>
<p>You’ll understand the difference between the Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo better after reading the below information:</p>
<p><strong>Slow Motion</strong></p>
<p> Video is produced at an 8-times slower rate than usual, equivalent to the speed of a movie, advertisement, or sporting event.</p>
<p><strong>Super Slow Motion</strong></p>

<p>Slow-motion video is often created by filming at a fast frame per second (fps) speed and then playing back at a far slower pace. This results in intriguing videos with slowed-down motion. The event is captured at 960 frames per second with the Super Slow-mo function, four times quicker than conventional slow motion. When it’s replayed at 30 frames per second, it’s 32 times slower, making mundane moments appear spectacular.</p>
<p>To capture super slow-motion videos with your Samsung Galaxy S20 and later models, follow the instructions below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the camera on your phone by tapping the <strong>Camera</strong> app.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, click on the <strong>Super Slow-Mo</strong> option to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Press the <strong>White Circle</strong> in the center to start the recording and press it again to stop when you are done.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that your phone’s video resolution is already on HD because Super Slow-Mo only supports HD resolutions.</p>

Even in the super slow-mo, there might be some unnecessary parts (since it is more detailed) that you need to cut out or the parts that need some enhancements to make the video look captivating.</p>
<p>However, not every phone is eligible to edit super slow-mo videos by not degrading the video resolutions. But Samsung Galaxy S21 allows you to do that by keeping the video resolution intact. You can edit the Super Slow-Mo videos with Galaxy S21 by following these instructions:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app and navigate the super slow-mo video you wish to edit.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, play it and tap the screen. You will see <strong>three vertical dots</strong> in the right corner. Click on them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the <strong>Editor</strong> option from the dropdown menu that appears.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After that, you can adjust the length, crop the video, add effects, add stickers, add music, etc., by selecting from the bottom menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you’re done editing, click on the <strong>Save</strong> option at the top to save the video to your <strong>Gallery</strong>.</p>

<p>Before we demonstrate how to capture a super slow-mo with a Huawei Mate 20 and later models, we’ll explain this popular capture mode.</p>
<p>To begin, you should be aware that a camera&#x2F;camera sensor collects a specific number of frames per second. The movie becomes legible by combining these pictures; the more images there are, the more fluent the video will be. The naked eye is thought to decipher about 60 pictures every second.</p>
<p>The benefit of improved camera sensors is that you can capture a maximum number of photos per second (some smartphones can record up to 960 &#x2F; second) and slow down the sampling rate to produce a super slow-motion effect on the Huawei Mate 20 or later models.</p>
<p>Now, follow the stepwise guide to record super slow-mo with Huawei Mate 40 or later models:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your phone’s <strong>Camera</strong> go to <strong>More</strong> to select the <strong>Slow-Mo</strong> option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> By default, you will see 4x on the slow-mo capture mode, which means the video will be recorded at 120FPS. Huawei Mate 40 allows you to capture up to 128X, i.e, 3840FPS for fast moving objects. To enable the <strong>Super Slo-Mo</strong> feature, select the <strong>32X or 128X</strong> in this mode.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the <strong>Circle</strong> in the center to start and stop the recording. The video will be saved in your <strong>Gallery</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Shoot-Slo-Mo-Videos-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Shoot-Slo-Mo-Videos-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Shoot Slo-Mo Videos on iPhone?"></a>Part 5: How to Shoot Slo-Mo Videos on iPhone?</h2><p>Slow-motion film on your iPhone essentially means slowing the fps so that everything appears to move slower inside the video. It is a popular effect employed by artists to produce one-of-a-kind video clips of sports footage, natural scenes, or sequences with a lot of dramatic motion.</p>
<p>Slow-motion films are supported by all iPhones, beginning with the 5S model, and the capability gets more robust and more stable with each successive generation. Shooting slow-motion films with your iPhone are addicting and enjoyable, and it adds drama to various settings.</p>
<p>Here is a step-by-step method for filming slow-mo with an iPhone, regardless of model.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone and go to the <strong>Slow-Mo</strong> effect by sliding from the options above. Change the frame rate on the upper right corner to 120, 240, 720, depending on the iPhone models you’re using.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, start the recording by clicking the <strong>Red Circle</strong> in the center or either of the <strong>Volume</strong> button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After you’re done recording, press the <strong>Red Circle</strong> again and head towards the <strong>Gallery</strong> to view the recorded video.</p>

But don’t worry, with the following tips, we have got you covered:</p>
<p><strong>Utilize A Tripod</strong></p>
<p>It’s critical to keep your phone as steady as possible when filming in Super Slow-mo since shaking might conflict with your video and hinder it from recognizing motions when set to auto-record. To get the most out of Super Slow-mo, we recommend using a tripod whenever feasible.</p>
<p><em>You can check these</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><em>tripods for iPhone</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Transition Between Single and Multi-Takes</strong></p>
<p>To boost your chances of catching the ideal timing in Super Slow-mo, your phone allows you to record in Multi-Take mode, which can capture many bursts of Super Slow-mo in one video.</p>
<p>When combined with an auto record, additional Super Slow-mo videos will be captured as much as the focus box senses activity and will end only when you end filming. The manual record works similarly. However, you’ll have to physically hit the trigger each time you wish to record a picture in Super Slow-mo.</p>
<p>As the name indicates, Single-Take will record a single Super Slow-mo clip and then cease recording a moment or two later. Because Multi-Take clips are often more extensive, this could save a large storage capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Readjust the Focus</strong></p>
<p>The focus or auto-recording is tiny by default. Fortunately, you can enlarge it to improve its odds of recognizing movement. To adjust the size of the box, hold it until only its edges are visible, then move any corner from the others to expand the box’s area. Simply tap anywhere outside the borders to verify the adjustment when you’re happy with the size.</p>
<p><strong>Capture in Natural Light</strong></p>
<p>Because of the large number of frames it collects, Super Slow-mo works the best in natural daylight situations. Though not visible to the human eye, indoor lighting, especially LED bulbs and tiny fluorescents, seems to flash at very high rates. Even if the environment is well-lit, Super Slow-mo detects this and shows your subject in a substantially darker tone.</p>
<p><strong>View the Video at Normal Speed</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to watch your Super Slow-mo movies at regular speed, deactivate Super Slow-mo playing by tapping on the option directly below the video. This will give you a greater understanding of your phone’s incredible capacity to bring the world to a halt.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><strong>Super Slow Motion</strong> videos are excellent for showcasing the action and conveying tales, and they are also entertaining and straightforward to create. Your only constraints are time and imagination. However, your Android or iPhone’s camera has many more tricks in its sleeve: Live images, time-lapse, Panoramas, and Portrait mode let you express yourself freely!</p>

But don’t worry, with the following tips, we have got you covered:</p>
<p><strong>Utilize A Tripod</strong></p>
<p>It’s critical to keep your phone as steady as possible when filming in Super Slow-mo since shaking might conflict with your video and hinder it from recognizing motions when set to auto-record. To get the most out of Super Slow-mo, we recommend using a tripod whenever feasible.</p>
<p><em>You can check these</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><em>tripods for iPhone</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Transition Between Single and Multi-Takes</strong></p>
<p>To boost your chances of catching the ideal timing in Super Slow-mo, your phone allows you to record in Multi-Take mode, which can capture many bursts of Super Slow-mo in one video.</p>
<p>When combined with an auto record, additional Super Slow-mo videos will be captured as much as the focus box senses activity and will end only when you end filming. The manual record works similarly. However, you’ll have to physically hit the trigger each time you wish to record a picture in Super Slow-mo.</p>
<p>As the name indicates, Single-Take will record a single Super Slow-mo clip and then cease recording a moment or two later. Because Multi-Take clips are often more extensive, this could save a large storage capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Readjust the Focus</strong></p>
<p>The focus or auto-recording is tiny by default. Fortunately, you can enlarge it to improve its odds of recognizing movement. To adjust the size of the box, hold it until only its edges are visible, then move any corner from the others to expand the box’s area. Simply tap anywhere outside the borders to verify the adjustment when you’re happy with the size.</p>
<p><strong>Capture in Natural Light</strong></p>
<p>Because of the large number of frames it collects, Super Slow-mo works the best in natural daylight situations. Though not visible to the human eye, indoor lighting, especially LED bulbs and tiny fluorescents, seems to flash at very high rates. Even if the environment is well-lit, Super Slow-mo detects this and shows your subject in a substantially darker tone.</p>
<p><strong>View the Video at Normal Speed</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to watch your Super Slow-mo movies at regular speed, deactivate Super Slow-mo playing by tapping on the option directly below the video. This will give you a greater understanding of your phone’s incredible capacity to bring the world to a halt.</p>

<h2 id="Part-6-Tips-for-Recording-Super-Slow-Motion-Video-3"><a href="#Part-6-Tips-for-Recording-Super-Slow-Motion-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Tips for Recording Super Slow Motion Video"></a>Part 6: Tips for Recording Super Slow Motion Video</h2><p>Although super slow-motion videos are easy to record, they can be challenging for a content creator. But don’t worry, with the following tips, we have got you covered:</p>
<p><strong>Utilize A Tripod</strong></p>
<p>It’s critical to keep your phone as steady as possible when filming in Super Slow-mo since shaking might conflict with your video and hinder it from recognizing motions when set to auto-record. To get the most out of Super Slow-mo, we recommend using a tripod whenever feasible.</p>
<p><em>You can check these</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><em>tripods for iPhone</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Transition Between Single and Multi-Takes</strong></p>
<p>To boost your chances of catching the ideal timing in Super Slow-mo, your phone allows you to record in Multi-Take mode, which can capture many bursts of Super Slow-mo in one video.</p>
<p>When combined with an auto record, additional Super Slow-mo videos will be captured as much as the focus box senses activity and will end only when you end filming. The manual record works similarly. However, you’ll have to physically hit the trigger each time you wish to record a picture in Super Slow-mo.</p>
<p>As the name indicates, Single-Take will record a single Super Slow-mo clip and then cease recording a moment or two later. Because Multi-Take clips are often more extensive, this could save a large storage capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Readjust the Focus</strong></p>
<p>The focus or auto-recording is tiny by default. Fortunately, you can enlarge it to improve its odds of recognizing movement. To adjust the size of the box, hold it until only its edges are visible, then move any corner from the others to expand the box’s area. Simply tap anywhere outside the borders to verify the adjustment when you’re happy with the size.</p>
<p><strong>Capture in Natural Light</strong></p>
<p>Because of the large number of frames it collects, Super Slow-mo works the best in natural daylight situations. Though not visible to the human eye, indoor lighting, especially LED bulbs and tiny fluorescents, seems to flash at very high rates. Even if the environment is well-lit, Super Slow-mo detects this and shows your subject in a substantially darker tone.</p>
<p><strong>View the Video at Normal Speed</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to watch your Super Slow-mo movies at regular speed, deactivate Super Slow-mo playing by tapping on the option directly below the video. This will give you a greater understanding of your phone’s incredible capacity to bring the world to a halt.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><strong>Super Slow Motion</strong> videos are excellent for showcasing the action and conveying tales, and they are also entertaining and straightforward to create. Your only constraints are time and imagination. However, your Android or iPhone’s camera has many more tricks in its sleeve: Live images, time-lapse, Panoramas, and Portrait mode let you express yourself freely!</p>

Many Professional Photographers Use It to Make Creative Video Effects. This Guide Will Show You How to Use Green Screen to Videos in After Effects"></a>Green Screen Is a Widely Used Effect in After Effects. Many Professional Photographers Use It to Make Creative Video Effects. This Guide Will Show You How to Use Green Screen to Videos in After Effects</h2><p>You’ll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We’ll demonstrate how to do easily for you.</p>
<p>Let’s start off!</p>
<h2 id="1-Importing-your-footage"><a href="#1-Importing-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="1. Importing your footage"></a>1. Importing your footage</h2><p>After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the “Image Utilities” heading.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-green-screen-video-footage-ae.jpg"
                      alt="import green screen video footage ae"
                ></p>
<h2 id="2-Remove-the-green-color"><a href="#2-Remove-the-green-color" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove the green color"></a>2. Remove the green color</h2><p>After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the “Animation Presets” window, searching for the “Keylight” preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the “Effects Controls” window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen’s background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/remove-green-color-from-video-in-ae.jpg"
                      alt="remove green color from video in ae"
                ></p>
<h2 id="3-Clean-up-the-shot"><a href="#3-Clean-up-the-shot" class="headerlink" title="3. Clean up the shot"></a>3. Clean up the shot</h2><p>You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.</p>
<p>Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg"
                      alt="clean up green screen shot ae"
                ></p>
<p>You can go to the “Screen Matte” area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you’ve applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!</p>

<h2 id="Shots-recording-for-loop-masking"><a href="#Shots-recording-for-loop-masking" class="headerlink" title="Shots recording for loop masking"></a>Shots recording for loop masking</h2><p>The first and most crucial step for creating a good loop video is to record perfect shots. Here are the steps to record video shots for loop videos.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-create-a-loop-video"><a href="#How-to-create-a-loop-video" class="headerlink" title="How to create a loop video"></a>How to create a loop video</h3><p>Step1 Set your camera or phone on a tripod. Make sure it stands still and does not move.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-2.png"
                      alt="set up a camera"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Set it so that you have a door on one side and enough room for the subject to walk through the door and move out of the frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-3.png"
                      alt="move out of the frame"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Make sure all your outfits are ready.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-4.png"
                      alt="outfits ready"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Start recording on your camera. Walk through the door wearing the first outfit. Change your outfits and repeat the step with all your dresses. It would help if you kept the camera rolling while recording all these clips. Turning the recording on and off with every shot will result in many small movements.</p>

<p>Step2 Launch Wondershare Filmora, import the video clip into Filmora and place it on the first track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-5.png"
                      alt="import clip into filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Find a frame with an empty background, i.e., without the subject, and freeze the frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-6.png"
                      alt="empty background frame"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Extend the frozen frame and cut out the rest of the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-7.png"
                      alt="extend the frozen frame"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 We are done with the first track so lock it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-8.png"
                      alt="lock first track"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Import the clip again on the second track. And find the sections of the clips where the subject is walking in the video. Cut the remaining part.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-9.gif"
                      alt="import the clip on the second track"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 It will create several small sections on the second track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-10.png"
                      alt="second track sections"
                ></p>
<p>Step8 Put the first clip at the start of the timeline and move the playhead to find the frame containing enough room for the second outfit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-11.gif"
                      alt="put the first outfit clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step9 Move the second outfit to that playhead area.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-12.gif"
                      alt="put the second outfit"
                ></p>
<p>Step10 Double-click on the clip, go to effects, and choose a single-line mask.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-13.gif"
                      alt="choose single line mask"
                ></p>
<p>Step11 Drag the mask to the point where it shows the outfit on its right side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-14.gif"
                      alt="drag the mask line"
                ></p>
<p>Step12 Blur the mask edges by increasing blur numbers.</p>

<p>Step14 Move the mask to the left to reveal the entire frame, and repeat the same process with all outfits.</p>

<p>Step15 After finishing all outfits, copy the clip from the first outfit. And paste it on top of all the tracks after the last outfit. And add a mask keyframe to this section too.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step16 Unlock the first track and move the playhead to find the point where the subject with 4th outfit moves out of the frame. Then, cut the remaining part of the freeze frame on the right.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Post it on Instagram, and it will keep playing automatically and act like a loop video. Otherwise, duplicate this edited clip several times to create a longer loop video.

<p>Step2 Launch Wondershare Filmora, import the video clip into Filmora and place it on the first track.</p>

                      alt="import clip into filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Find a frame with an empty background, i.e., without the subject, and freeze the frame.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="empty background frame"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Extend the frozen frame and cut out the rest of the video.</p>

<p>Step6 Import the clip again on the second track. And find the sections of the clips where the subject is walking in the video. Cut the remaining part.</p>

In addition, a fast-processing feature is necessary to reduce the editing time significantly.</p>
<h3 id="·-Budget"><a href="#·-Budget" class="headerlink" title="· Budget"></a>· Budget</h3><p>Another factor that’s important to consider is your budget.

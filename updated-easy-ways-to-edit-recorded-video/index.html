Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don’t need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.</p>
<p>Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you’re on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don’t have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we’ve put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you’ll need to know to make stunning films, even if you’ve never done it before. We’ll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS"></a><strong>Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS</strong></h2><p>OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It’s open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Download and Install OBS</strong></p>
<p>Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Setup Screen Recording</strong></p>
<p>The window is divided into separate parts called “docks” when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you’ll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="obs setup screen recording"
                ></p>
<p>You’ll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Customize the Recording Source</strong></p>
<p>You’ll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select “Display Capture” by clicking the “+” icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click “OK”. At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you’re ready to begin recording. When you’re finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.</p>

MP4: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:</p>
<h3 id="TS"><a href="#TS" class="headerlink" title="TS"></a>TS</h3><p>TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.</p>
<h3 id="MP4"><a href="#MP4" class="headerlink" title="MP4"></a>MP4</h3><p>MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the ‘.ts’ extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.</p>
<h3 id="Bottom-Line"><a href="#Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom Line"></a>Bottom Line</h3><p>The article has shared great details about the TS format.

What Is TS Video Format?</h2><p>A TS format file is a Video Transport Stream file. The TS file extension is used to store video data, mostly on DVDs. The video files are standardly compressed with .MPEG video compression. If you are looking for a file extension to save streamed or broadcast videos, TS video format is ideal for this. Are you worried about how to play a TS file?</p>

<p>Well, a video file with this format can easily be played on a certain media player or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing program <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Pros and Coins about TS Video Format</h2><p>Everything has its beneficial factors and disadvantages, so does TS video format has. Are you ready to know more about the TS file format? After learning about the format, it’s time to share its advantages and drawbacks with you. Let’s get started!</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-of-TS-File-Format-1"><a href="#Advantages-of-TS-File-Format-1" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of TS File Format"></a>Advantages of TS File Format</h3><p>A great thing about TS format is that, after each keyframe, the file information is added automatically. The format is impressive when it comes to maintaining transmission integrity. This is because of all the elementary streams, synchronization patterns, and error corrections; everything is encapsulated in a container format.</p>
<p>Do you know what else benefits TS format has? It is widely used for broadcasting because broadcasting doesn’t need the complete stream for playing it. You can easily share large files over the communication media in real-time as tiny chunks of the audio or video file are sent. Along with this, the error is easily detected as extra information is shared with every chunk, helping in error detection.</p>
<h3 id="Drawbacks-of-TS-File-Format-1"><a href="#Drawbacks-of-TS-File-Format-1" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks of TS File Format"></a>Drawbacks of TS File Format</h3><p>Moving on to its disadvantages, let’s start with the device compatibility. The biggest drawback of using the TS file format is that it is not compatible with many devices. For instance, a built-in media player like Windows Media Player does not support the format; eventually, users must change the file format.</p>
<p>Do you know another significant disadvantage? You cannot share TS files online. Different platforms like Facebook, YouTube, etc., support other famous formats, so hence, sharing TS video files requires a format converter. Do you know how much space does a TS file occupies? Well, it acquires a significant storage space, more than other file formats.</p>

MP4: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:</p>
<h3 id="TS-1"><a href="#TS-1" class="headerlink" title="TS"></a>TS</h3><p>TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.</p>
<h3 id="MP4-1"><a href="#MP4-1" class="headerlink" title="MP4"></a>MP4</h3><p>MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the ‘.ts’ extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.</p>

MP4: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:</p>
<h3 id="TS-3"><a href="#TS-3" class="headerlink" title="TS"></a>TS</h3><p>TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.</p>
<h3 id="MP4-3"><a href="#MP4-3" class="headerlink" title="MP4"></a>MP4</h3><p>MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the ‘.ts’ extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.</p>
<h3 id="Bottom-Line-3"><a href="#Bottom-Line-3" class="headerlink" title="Bottom Line"></a>Bottom Line</h3><p>The article has shared great details about the TS format.

<p>Masking video editing is the process of hiding or obscuring certain elements in a video clip. This can be done for aesthetic purposes and is often used to remove unwanted objects or blemishes from the footage. Masking can be accomplished using a variety of methods, including rotoscoping, chroma-keying, and motion tracking.</p>

The mask is the portion of the video you’ve chosen to pick, either with a template or a custom frame. The mask then becomes isolated, and you may modify it as desired to produce your intended effect.</p>
<p>Masks may be used to do some fantastic things with your videos. You can clone people or objects, overlay several pictures, create glitch effects, blur faces out, etc. Masks add a lot of excitement and color to videos, making them more dynamic, enjoyable to watch, and professional.

<h3 id="Different-types-of-masking"><a href="#Different-types-of-masking" class="headerlink" title="Different types of masking"></a>Different types of masking</h3><p>There are three primary types of masking: rotoscoping, chroma-keying, and motion tracking.</p>
<p>Rotoscoping: Rotoscoping is the process of manually tracing an object in a video frame by frame to create a mask. This can be a time-consuming process, but it allows for very precise control over the masked area.</p>
<p>Chroma-keying: Chroma-keying is a type of masking that makes use of color to isolate a particular area of the frame. For example, this is often used to remove a green or blue screen from the footage, but can also be used to isolate other colors.</p>
<p>Motion tracking: Motion tracking is a masking technique that allows you to track the movement of an object in a video clip. This is often used to add special effects, such as explosions, to a video.</p>

<p>Masking video editing is the process of hiding or obscuring certain elements in a video clip. This can be done for aesthetic purposes and is often used to remove unwanted objects or blemishes from the footage. Masking can be accomplished using a variety of methods, including rotoscoping, chroma-keying, and motion tracking.</p>

The mask is the portion of the video you’ve chosen to pick, either with a template or a custom frame. The mask then becomes isolated, and you may modify it as desired to produce your intended effect.</p>
<p>Masks may be used to do some fantastic things with your videos. You can clone people or objects, overlay several pictures, create glitch effects, blur faces out, etc. Masks add a lot of excitement and color to videos, making them more dynamic, enjoyable to watch, and professional. It can draw attention - and keep it!</p>
<h3 id="Different-types-of-masking-1"><a href="#Different-types-of-masking-1" class="headerlink" title="Different types of masking"></a>Different types of masking</h3><p>There are three primary types of masking: rotoscoping, chroma-keying, and motion tracking.</p>
<p>Rotoscoping: Rotoscoping is the process of manually tracing an object in a video frame by frame to create a mask. This can be a time-consuming process, but it allows for very precise control over the masked area.</p>
<p>Chroma-keying: Chroma-keying is a type of masking that makes use of color to isolate a particular area of the frame. For example, this is often used to remove a green or blue screen from the footage, but can also be used to isolate other colors.</p>
<p>Motion tracking: Motion tracking is a masking technique that allows you to track the movement of an object in a video clip. This is often used to add special effects, such as explosions, to a video.</p>

<h2 id="Camtasia-Vs-Captivate-Which-Is-Better"><a href="#Camtasia-Vs-Captivate-Which-Is-Better" class="headerlink" title="Camtasia Vs Captivate Which Is Better"></a>Camtasia Vs Captivate Which Is Better</h2><p>Being a video editor, it’s critical to keep ahead of the curve in our fast-changing global world. From small enterprises to major corporations, eLearning applications have shown to be a significant tool for cutting expenses and increasing profits. Software like Camtasia and Captivate are in high demand as e-learning becomes a more vital aspect of our life. When it comes to creating a course or video instruction, these two applications are quite quick and useful. Whether you should choose a Camtasia or a Captivate relies entirely on your industry and what you want to accomplish with this application.</p>
<p>Often times between Camtasia vs Captivate, the question arises: “Which software is superior?” As a result, we’ve compared Camtasia and Captivate based on the software packages themselves, as well as some important features, similarities, and differences. Software stimulation, production, demonstration screencasts, and translation of PowerPoint presentations into various formats are all possible using TechSmith Camtasia and Adobe Captivate. Camtasia offers fewer online learning alternatives, but it boasts incredible screen and video capture, as well as video editing facilities. This application allows you to alter the sound and visual characteristics manually. Video artists may improve video quality by using auxiliary microphones and cameras. The editing of the video is Camtasia’s most impressive function. It allows you to cut and paste films, add transitions and subtitles to them, as well as do color grading and color correction.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Overall-Comparison"><a href="#Part-1-Overall-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Overall Comparison"></a>Part 1. Overall Comparison</h2><p>Each piece of software may be used to create eLearning and lesson material. Despite the fact that Adobe Captivate offers amazing transitional features and visual effect tools, it does not include video editing, which is, in my view, the backbone of developing eLearning material that adheres to the learning management system. As a result, Adobe Captivate needs the use of Adobe Premiere to edit and correct any problems in your films. Adobe Captivate, on the other hand, is the greatest alternative for developing quality eLearning and lesson software material. It’s an excellent tool for developing online courses and tutorials. However, as previously said, Adobe Captivate is not simple to use and is not recommended for novices. Camtasia, on the other hand, seems to be the most economical and practical alternative for you based on your abilities if you are an entry-level editor and want to master the fundamentals of video editing and lesson production on your own.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-8"><a href="#Conclusion-8" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Camtasia’s technique of making a presentation using an individual movie works well for developers who are knowledgeable with video applications. Developers inexperienced with the method may have significant trouble with the editing operation in Camtasia since screen grabs occur in real time. Editing material using slides in Captivate 2 is often less onerous than the video format utilized in Camtasia. The biggest issue is that long presentations might result in a large number of slides that can be time consuming to look through and result in a greater file size for the Flash file that user’s access. Hence, we like to advocate Filmora as a reasonable method between these two.</p>

Adobe Captivate Review</h2><p>Captivate is an Adobe tool designed to make online learning more engaging and interactive. Students save time since they can take their classes with them. Captivate has no built-in video editing tools. To do so, you’ll need to use additional Adobe applications. Captivate allows students to study at any time and from any location.

<p><strong>Step 2: Remove Any Unnecessary Background Sounds</strong></p>

If your voice-over has any background noise, you may simply eliminate it from the whole clip or a segment of the video where the sound is inappropriate. In Filmora, you may also add your favourite ones to the videos by importing the files and adding them to the timeline. You may also isolate the audio from your video clips and chop or sync it with the video using the timeline of this video editor.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="filmora remove bg sounds"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Perform Professional Video Editing</strong></p>
<p>Right-click the video and choose edit from the menu. Then, by hitting the proper effects buttons, you may rotate the movie. You may also swivel 90 degrees anticlockwise&#x2F;clockwise, flip level, or go vertical, depending on your requirements. Then, in that instance. You can also add a variety of video effects, and the greatest part is that you can use others from the standard library as well, allowing you to put it with greater adjustment. The Editor in Filmora allows you to add Animated Titles, amazing effects, Audio Enhancements, and more to your recorded video.</p>

You may check the audio sound within the application to see whether it’s in sync with your recorded video clip once you’ve made any necessary edits to your audio.</p>

                ></p>

<p>Click “Export” in the Toolbar to export the video to the specified format and also, you may share it on-spot.

<h2 id="Conclusion-11"><a href="#Conclusion-11" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Camtasia’s technique of making a presentation using an individual movie works well for developers who are knowledgeable with video applications. Developers inexperienced with the method may have significant trouble with the editing operation in Camtasia since screen grabs occur in real time. Editing material using slides in Captivate 2 is often less onerous than the video format utilized in Camtasia. The biggest issue is that long presentations might result in a large number of slides that can be time consuming to look through and result in a greater file size for the Flash file that user’s access. Hence, we like to advocate Filmora as a reasonable method between these two.</p>

Don’t have any idea how to focus on specific mini-things? Then don’t worry! In this article, you’ll get a step-by-step process to add miniature effects to your video. At the end of the process, you’ll have cinematic shots. Then start with us now! Scroll more to get pro tips!</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-a-Miniature-Effect"><a href="#What-Is-a-Miniature-Effect" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Miniature Effect?"></a>What Is a Miniature Effect?</h2><p><img

                      alt="after adding a miniature effect"
                ></p>
<p>But first, let’s learn the logic of making the miniature effect. As many video editing pros present on Tiktok, the miniature effect is a fun way to brighten up your photography or video shots. For example, when taking a video or a time-lapse of a landscape, we always have a bigger depth of field, so most objects in the frame are in focus.</p>
<p>However, when we film a miniature model, the depth of field is shallow. So, we only see some objects in focus, and the rest is blurry. This visual trick makes our brain believe that the big landscape we’re seeing is actually a tiny model.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="a miniature effect for landscape"
                ></p>
<p>To create a miniature look, we can use specific effects to fake a shallow depth of field, and then the landscape view will look like a tiny model. While some keys to notice before making the miniature effect are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It utilizes <strong>selective blur</strong> to make things appear like <strong>small</strong></li>
<li>The miniature effect works best for footage filmed from <strong>a high angle</strong>.</li>
<li>The tiny effect is usually used in <strong>drone footage, time lapses</strong>, or <strong>landscape photography</strong>.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> filmora has a unique <strong>“stock media”</strong> option that enables us to use all these elements and more to boost our videos!</p>
<h5 id="Step2-Choose-any-stock-footage"><a href="#Step2-Choose-any-stock-footage" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Choose any stock footage"></a>Step2 Choose any stock footage</h5><p>If you don’t have good-quality footage, but want to boost your video, here is how. You can get the miniature effect without a big format view camera or specialized lens.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Filmora and select any stock footage in Wondershare Filmora.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="choose stock footage from stock media in filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Move to the <strong>stock media</strong> folder on the above bar in the Wondershare Filmora. Or you can look towards the left window, where you will see the sample <strong>videos tab.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the sample videos tab, and a new <strong>window</strong> will appear on the library screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here you will see almost more than <strong>20 videos.</strong> So, instead of using the actual recorded footage, we’ll make do with what we have by <strong>default</strong>. After selecting and adding the stock footage of your choice. Then you have to follow the below process:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, hold the Stock Footage as shown in the folder section.</li>
<li>Then <strong>Drag and Drop</strong> it to the timeline section for further editing.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

<ul>
<li>The <strong>latest version</strong> has an unlimited stock library.</li>
<li>After purchasing any plan, you can access <strong>Stock Media</strong> (Unsplash, Giphy, Pixabay, Pixel).</li>

<h5 id="Step3-Head-to-the-effect-panel"><a href="#Step3-Head-to-the-effect-panel" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Head to the effect panel"></a>Step3 Head to the effect panel</h5><p>As we are working on miniature effects, what do we need first? First, we ensure that we have a <strong>Blur</strong> effect on the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="search for the blur effect on effect panel in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To add a blur effect from the panel, follow the below-mentioned steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, move toward the above tabs.</li>
<li>Then click on the 5th section, which is <strong>Effect</strong></li>
<li>After selecting the effect tab, a new window will <strong>pop up</strong>.</li>
<li>In this section, we have <strong>500+</strong> different effects.</li>
<li>Then, <strong>click</strong> on the search bar.</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong> for the Blur effect.</li>
<li>After that, click on the <strong>Blur 2</strong></li>
<li>Then <strong>Download</strong> this effect if you haven’t done this already.</li>
</ul>

Again, see how precise it turned out. To add effect, follow below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First, drag</strong> and <strong>Drop</strong> the effect toward the timeline.</li>
<li>Then, make sure to release the effect on the video to give it a lens blur appearance.</li>
</ul>

If you need more blur level in your video and make it more cinematic, then follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, ensure that the <strong>opacity</strong> of the blur effect is 100%.</li>
<li>Then, if you still want more blurriness, add <strong>Blur 2</strong> effect multiple times on the video.</li>
<li>Finally, add effect by just the <strong>Drag and Drop</strong></li>
</ul>

<li>Add the same video clip 2nd time on the timeline.</li>
<li>Add it by just the <strong>Drag and Drop</strong></li>
<li>Make sure you add it to 2nd video track in the timeline above the first one.</li>
</ul>

Due to this, we will have a selective blur portion. For this, follow the below guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video present in 2nd track.</li>
<li>The settings tab will be open in the top left section.</li>
<li>Then find the <strong>Mask</strong> section and click on it.</li>
<li>After this, <strong>click</strong> on the <strong>Double-line</strong>.</li>
<li>Set the mask on video according to your style and choice.</li>
</ul>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> you can adjust the mask size and position by rotating and changing its shape.</p>
<p>Watch the rotating and adjusting actions as shown below!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="rotation of mask in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>For example, when we add a mask in the below time-lapse video, follow the above mask adjustments. Unfortunately, we can’t get good results. Therefore, we will apply another way to add a mask by changing shape and position. Follow the instructions for modifications:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="blur the object near to camera and focus on the distant object"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Make a building or any object <strong>Blurry</strong> near the camera because it is not present within the depth of field.</li>
<li>While the <strong>object is far</strong> from the camera, it is focused because it is in the depth of the field.</li>
<li>Then adjust the mask, as per your choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Want to change the shape of the mask? Then follow the below steps:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the video present in 2nd video track.</li>
<li><strong>Settings</strong> will activate on the top left side.</li>
<li>Then click on the <strong>Mask</strong> tab to open it.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Rectangular</strong> mask from the list and apply it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> make sure you are masking the same extent and excluding the object you want to be out of focus.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to mask the whole object, which is far, but we want to make it in focus! For this, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the same stock video clip a <strong>third time</strong> on the third video track of the timeline.</li>
<li>Then add a mask in a <strong>Rectangle</strong> shape on the building.</li>
<li>Don’t <strong>blur</strong> the edge of this mask.</li>
</ul>

<li>Open Filmora and select any stock footage in Wondershare Filmora.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Click on the sample videos tab, and a new <strong>window</strong> will appear on the library screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here you will see almost more than <strong>20 videos.</strong> So, instead of using the actual recorded footage, we’ll make do with what we have by <strong>default</strong>. After selecting and adding the stock footage of your choice. Then you have to follow the below process:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, hold the Stock Footage as shown in the folder section.</li>
<li>Then <strong>Drag and Drop</strong> it to the timeline section for further editing.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

First, we ensure that we have a <strong>Blur</strong> effect on the video.</p>

                ></p>
<p>To add a blur effect from the panel, follow the below-mentioned steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, move toward the above tabs.</li>
<li>Then click on the 5th section, which is <strong>Effect</strong></li>
<li>After selecting the effect tab, a new window will <strong>pop up</strong>.</li>
<li>In this section, we have <strong>500+</strong> different effects.</li>
<li>Then, <strong>click</strong> on the search bar.</li>

<li>After that, click on the <strong>Blur 2</strong></li>
<li>Then <strong>Download</strong> this effect if you haven’t done this already.</li>
</ul>

Again, see how precise it turned out. To add effect, follow below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First, drag</strong> and <strong>Drop</strong> the effect toward the timeline.</li>
<li>Then, make sure to release the effect on the video to give it a lens blur appearance.</li>
</ul>

If you need more blur level in your video and make it more cinematic, then follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, ensure that the <strong>opacity</strong> of the blur effect is 100%.</li>
<li>Then, if you still want more blurriness, add <strong>Blur 2</strong> effect multiple times on the video.</li>
<li>Finally, add effect by just the <strong>Drag and Drop</strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Ensure you set the output file to the appropriate resolution to avoid lowering the quality of the video you edit.</li>
<li>Resist the temptation to insert the artsy shots before you lay a basic framework. It would be wise to focus on the musician’s performance before you insert shots of the beautiful scenery.</li>
<li>As you edit, it would help to create a storyline that matches the lyrics. You could create a simple story or a complex one.</li>
<li>Since your computer might struggle to process numerous 4k videos, it would help to create proxy files as early as possible so you can save your progress along the way.</li>
<li>During filming, create and collect your favorite b-roll shots. These clips provide extra information or context to anyone watching your music video.</li>
<li>Ensure you match the video to the beat and look out for areas where the performer sings along. We guarantee your fans will notice the slightest delay between the song and the performer in the video.</li>
<li>Once the music video looks polished and synchronized, you can adjust brightness, contrast, and exposure and change the white balance.</li>
<li>Lastly, you could begin or end the video with the artists’ credits, such as their names or logo. Since it is a relevant piece of information, ensure this segment of the video grabs the viewers’ attention.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If you want your song to go viral, you ought to put in the work and make the video as good as the soundtrack.

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>
<p>FAQs about GoPro Video Editing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does GoPro has its own video editor?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, GoPro has its own video editor “Quik”. It is available on mobile phones and desktops both. It is simple and easy to use. It provides basic features to edit your video. But the main disadvantage of this desktop software is that it supports only GoPro videos, you can’t import files from other devices. Although this isn’t the issue with Quik mobile app, here you can import videos from other devices also.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Can I make videos for social media with a GoPro?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It was basically made for recording sports and action videos. But as the market is revolutionized and new models are released it has covered a wide range of the video industry like vlogging, travel and cooking videos e.t.c. As new models of GoPros are waterproof, you can get some amazing underwater shots for your Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is GoPro media format?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>GoPro export files in popular file format MP4. MP4 is the most common file format and is supported by almost all the video editors. While it is efficient and takes less storage but isn’t supported in many devices.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How do I transfer files from my GoPro to Mac?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> You can transfer your GoPro files through 3 methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eject the SD card from your GoPro and connect it to your Mac using a SD card adapter to transfer files.</li>
<li>Connect your GoPro to Mac through USB connector and use “iphoto” or any other photo importer to import files.</li>

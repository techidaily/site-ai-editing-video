<p><strong>What you need to prepare:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A computer (Windows or macOS)</li>
<li>Your video materials.</li>
<li>Filmora video editor</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>Step 1</p>
<p>Download and Install the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Then, click on <strong>New Project</strong> once the program starts.</p>
<p>Step 2</p>
<p>Go to <strong>Titles</strong> and drag the Default Title to the Timeline. Then, double-click on the Default Title clip to open its settings. Here, type in your text → change the text color to <strong>Black</strong> → click <strong>OK</strong> → take a snapshot.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/snapshot.png"
                      alt="edit title filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3</p>
<p>Double-click on the Default Title once more and simply change the text color to anything other than black this time. Then, click <strong>OK</strong> and take another snapshot. After this, delete the Default Title from the Timeline.</p>
<p>Step 4</p>
<p>Next, go to <strong>Sample Color</strong> and drag the White color to the Timeline. Increase the White Color clip’s duration to 10 seconds by dragging the tail of the clip to the right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/white.png"
                      alt="sample color filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5</p>
<p>For the next step, you need to download a simple <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pngfind.com/mpng/ihbooTJ%5Feffect-gfx-png-black-vignette-png-transparent-png/" >Vignette png image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Then, import the Vignette image into Filmora. Go to <strong>My Media</strong> and click on <strong>Import Media.</strong> Import it and drag the image to the Timeline.

Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>

In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-2"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

While there are manifold varieties of augmented reality usage, the following section highlights the best examples of integrating AR into brand marketing:</p>
<h3 id="01Walmart-Inventory-Control-2"><a href="#01Walmart-Inventory-Control-2" class="headerlink" title="01Walmart- Inventory Control"></a>01Walmart- Inventory Control</h3><p>With the aim to examine the dual credibility of its brand stores as online fulfillment as well as physical shopping centers, Walmart in October 2020, announced the proposition of its 4 shopping units as ‘test centers’ of augmented reality, where the latter was supposed to aid in the management and tracking of company inventories.</p>
<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

While there are manifold varieties of augmented reality usage, the following section highlights the best examples of integrating AR into brand marketing:</p>

<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>

The method was initially limited to high-end lenses, but super slo-mo has become increasingly superior as smartphone technology advances.</p>
<p>Super slo-mo is a terrific technique to learn how to use if you want to accentuate a dramatic moment or extend the humiliation of a friend you captured in an embarrassing scenario. This article has stepwise guides and tips for recording super slo-mo on your phone. Let’s get going!</p>

<p>Super Slow-mo movie may be displayed as 6-12 sec long on old smartphones, such as Galaxy S9&#x2F;S9+ and Note9. However, the newer versions, such as Galaxy S10 Series, can play super slow-mo movies up to 14.8 sec.</p>
<p>You’ll understand the difference between the Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo better after reading the below information:</p>
<p><strong>Slow Motion</strong></p>
<p> Video is produced at an 8-times slower rate than usual, equivalent to the speed of a movie, advertisement, or sporting event.</p>
<p><strong>Super Slow Motion</strong></p>
<p>Videos are played 32 times slower than usual, catching minute changes in facial gestures and fast-moving elements.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-Super-Slo-Mo-Videos-with-Samsung-Galaxy-S20-and-Later-models"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-Super-Slo-Mo-Videos-with-Samsung-Galaxy-S20-and-Later-models" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Record Super Slo-Mo Videos with Samsung Galaxy S20 and Later models?"></a>Part 2: How to Record Super Slo-Mo Videos with Samsung Galaxy S20 and Later models?</h2><p><strong>Models That Support Super Slow-Mo:</strong> Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20+, Galaxy S20+ Ultra, Galaxy Z Flip, and later models.</p>
<p>Slow-motion video is often created by filming at a fast frame per second (fps) speed and then playing back at a far slower pace. This results in intriguing videos with slowed-down motion. The event is captured at 960 frames per second with the Super Slow-mo function, four times quicker than conventional slow motion. When it’s replayed at 30 frames per second, it’s 32 times slower, making mundane moments appear spectacular.</p>
<p>To capture super slow-motion videos with your Samsung Galaxy S20 and later models, follow the instructions below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the camera on your phone by tapping the <strong>Camera</strong> app.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, click on the <strong>Super Slow-Mo</strong> option to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Press the <strong>White Circle</strong> in the center to start the recording and press it again to stop when you are done.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that your phone’s video resolution is already on HD because Super Slow-Mo only supports HD resolutions.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Edit-Super-Slow-Motion-Video-in-Samsung-Galaxy-S21"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Edit-Super-Slow-Motion-Video-in-Samsung-Galaxy-S21" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Edit Super Slow Motion Video in Samsung Galaxy S21?"></a>Part 3: How to Edit Super Slow Motion Video in Samsung Galaxy S21?</h2><p>Only capturing the super slow-motion videos is not enough, especially if you are a content creator. Even in the super slow-mo, there might be some unnecessary parts (since it is more detailed) that you need to cut out or the parts that need some enhancements to make the video look captivating.</p>
<p>However, not every phone is eligible to edit super slow-mo videos by not degrading the video resolutions. But Samsung Galaxy S21 allows you to do that by keeping the video resolution intact. You can edit the Super Slow-Mo videos with Galaxy S21 by following these instructions:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app and navigate the super slow-mo video you wish to edit.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, play it and tap the screen. You will see <strong>three vertical dots</strong> in the right corner. Click on them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the <strong>Editor</strong> option from the dropdown menu that appears.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After that, you can adjust the length, crop the video, add effects, add stickers, add music, etc., by selecting from the bottom menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you’re done editing, click on the <strong>Save</strong> option at the top to save the video to your <strong>Gallery</strong>.</p>

<p>Before we demonstrate how to capture a super slow-mo with a Huawei Mate 20 and later models, we’ll explain this popular capture mode.</p>
<p>To begin, you should be aware that a camera&#x2F;camera sensor collects a specific number of frames per second. The movie becomes legible by combining these pictures; the more images there are, the more fluent the video will be. The naked eye is thought to decipher about 60 pictures every second.</p>
<p>The benefit of improved camera sensors is that you can capture a maximum number of photos per second (some smartphones can record up to 960 &#x2F; second) and slow down the sampling rate to produce a super slow-motion effect on the Huawei Mate 20 or later models.</p>
<p>Now, follow the stepwise guide to record super slow-mo with Huawei Mate 40 or later models:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your phone’s <strong>Camera</strong> go to <strong>More</strong> to select the <strong>Slow-Mo</strong> option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> By default, you will see 4x on the slow-mo capture mode, which means the video will be recorded at 120FPS. Huawei Mate 40 allows you to capture up to 128X, i.e, 3840FPS for fast moving objects. To enable the <strong>Super Slo-Mo</strong> feature, select the <strong>32X or 128X</strong> in this mode.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the <strong>Circle</strong> in the center to start and stop the recording. The video will be saved in your <strong>Gallery</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Shoot-Slo-Mo-Videos-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Shoot-Slo-Mo-Videos-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Shoot Slo-Mo Videos on iPhone?"></a>Part 5: How to Shoot Slo-Mo Videos on iPhone?</h2><p>Slow-motion film on your iPhone essentially means slowing the fps so that everything appears to move slower inside the video. It is a popular effect employed by artists to produce one-of-a-kind video clips of sports footage, natural scenes, or sequences with a lot of dramatic motion.</p>
<p>Slow-motion films are supported by all iPhones, beginning with the 5S model, and the capability gets more robust and more stable with each successive generation. Shooting slow-motion films with your iPhone are addicting and enjoyable, and it adds drama to various settings.</p>
<p>Here is a step-by-step method for filming slow-mo with an iPhone, regardless of model.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone and go to the <strong>Slow-Mo</strong> effect by sliding from the options above. Change the frame rate on the upper right corner to 120, 240, 720, depending on the iPhone models you’re using.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, start the recording by clicking the <strong>Red Circle</strong> in the center or either of the <strong>Volume</strong> button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After you’re done recording, press the <strong>Red Circle</strong> again and head towards the <strong>Gallery</strong> to view the recorded video.</p>

But don’t worry, with the following tips, we have got you covered:</p>
<p><strong>Utilize A Tripod</strong></p>
<p>It’s critical to keep your phone as steady as possible when filming in Super Slow-mo since shaking might conflict with your video and hinder it from recognizing motions when set to auto-record. To get the most out of Super Slow-mo, we recommend using a tripod whenever feasible.</p>
<p><em>You can check these</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><em>tripods for iPhone</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Transition Between Single and Multi-Takes</strong></p>
<p>To boost your chances of catching the ideal timing in Super Slow-mo, your phone allows you to record in Multi-Take mode, which can capture many bursts of Super Slow-mo in one video.</p>
<p>When combined with an auto record, additional Super Slow-mo videos will be captured as much as the focus box senses activity and will end only when you end filming. The manual record works similarly. However, you’ll have to physically hit the trigger each time you wish to record a picture in Super Slow-mo.</p>
<p>As the name indicates, Single-Take will record a single Super Slow-mo clip and then cease recording a moment or two later. Because Multi-Take clips are often more extensive, this could save a large storage capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Readjust the Focus</strong></p>
<p>The focus or auto-recording is tiny by default. Fortunately, you can enlarge it to improve its odds of recognizing movement. To adjust the size of the box, hold it until only its edges are visible, then move any corner from the others to expand the box’s area. Simply tap anywhere outside the borders to verify the adjustment when you’re happy with the size.</p>
<p><strong>Capture in Natural Light</strong></p>
<p>Because of the large number of frames it collects, Super Slow-mo works the best in natural daylight situations. Though not visible to the human eye, indoor lighting, especially LED bulbs and tiny fluorescents, seems to flash at very high rates. Even if the environment is well-lit, Super Slow-mo detects this and shows your subject in a substantially darker tone.</p>
<p><strong>View the Video at Normal Speed</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to watch your Super Slow-mo movies at regular speed, deactivate Super Slow-mo playing by tapping on the option directly below the video. This will give you a greater understanding of your phone’s incredible capacity to bring the world to a halt.</p>

<p>Super Slow-mo movie may be displayed as 6-12 sec long on old smartphones, such as Galaxy S9&#x2F;S9+ and Note9. However, the newer versions, such as Galaxy S10 Series, can play super slow-mo movies up to 14.8 sec.</p>
<p>You’ll understand the difference between the Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo better after reading the below information:</p>
<p><strong>Slow Motion</strong></p>
<p> Video is produced at an 8-times slower rate than usual, equivalent to the speed of a movie, advertisement, or sporting event.</p>
<p><strong>Super Slow Motion</strong></p>
<p>Videos are played 32 times slower than usual, catching minute changes in facial gestures and fast-moving elements.</p>

<p>Slow-motion video is often created by filming at a fast frame per second (fps) speed and then playing back at a far slower pace. This results in intriguing videos with slowed-down motion. The event is captured at 960 frames per second with the Super Slow-mo function, four times quicker than conventional slow motion. When it’s replayed at 30 frames per second, it’s 32 times slower, making mundane moments appear spectacular.</p>
<p>To capture super slow-motion videos with your Samsung Galaxy S20 and later models, follow the instructions below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the camera on your phone by tapping the <strong>Camera</strong> app.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, click on the <strong>Super Slow-Mo</strong> option to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Press the <strong>White Circle</strong> in the center to start the recording and press it again to stop when you are done.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that your phone’s video resolution is already on HD because Super Slow-Mo only supports HD resolutions.</p>

Even in the super slow-mo, there might be some unnecessary parts (since it is more detailed) that you need to cut out or the parts that need some enhancements to make the video look captivating.</p>
<p>However, not every phone is eligible to edit super slow-mo videos by not degrading the video resolutions. But Samsung Galaxy S21 allows you to do that by keeping the video resolution intact. You can edit the Super Slow-Mo videos with Galaxy S21 by following these instructions:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app and navigate the super slow-mo video you wish to edit.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, play it and tap the screen. You will see <strong>three vertical dots</strong> in the right corner. Click on them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the <strong>Editor</strong> option from the dropdown menu that appears.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After that, you can adjust the length, crop the video, add effects, add stickers, add music, etc., by selecting from the bottom menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you’re done editing, click on the <strong>Save</strong> option at the top to save the video to your <strong>Gallery</strong>.</p>

<p>Before we demonstrate how to capture a super slow-mo with a Huawei Mate 20 and later models, we’ll explain this popular capture mode.</p>
<p>To begin, you should be aware that a camera&#x2F;camera sensor collects a specific number of frames per second. The movie becomes legible by combining these pictures; the more images there are, the more fluent the video will be. The naked eye is thought to decipher about 60 pictures every second.</p>
<p>The benefit of improved camera sensors is that you can capture a maximum number of photos per second (some smartphones can record up to 960 &#x2F; second) and slow down the sampling rate to produce a super slow-motion effect on the Huawei Mate 20 or later models.</p>
<p>Now, follow the stepwise guide to record super slow-mo with Huawei Mate 40 or later models:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your phone’s <strong>Camera</strong> go to <strong>More</strong> to select the <strong>Slow-Mo</strong> option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> By default, you will see 4x on the slow-mo capture mode, which means the video will be recorded at 120FPS. Huawei Mate 40 allows you to capture up to 128X, i.e, 3840FPS for fast moving objects. To enable the <strong>Super Slo-Mo</strong> feature, select the <strong>32X or 128X</strong> in this mode.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the <strong>Circle</strong> in the center to start and stop the recording. The video will be saved in your <strong>Gallery</strong>.</p>

It is a popular effect employed by artists to produce one-of-a-kind video clips of sports footage, natural scenes, or sequences with a lot of dramatic motion.</p>
<p>Slow-motion films are supported by all iPhones, beginning with the 5S model, and the capability gets more robust and more stable with each successive generation. Shooting slow-motion films with your iPhone are addicting and enjoyable, and it adds drama to various settings.</p>
<p>Here is a step-by-step method for filming slow-mo with an iPhone, regardless of model.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone and go to the <strong>Slow-Mo</strong> effect by sliding from the options above. Change the frame rate on the upper right corner to 120, 240, 720, depending on the iPhone models you’re using.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, start the recording by clicking the <strong>Red Circle</strong> in the center or either of the <strong>Volume</strong> button.</p>

But don’t worry, with the following tips, we have got you covered:</p>
<p><strong>Utilize A Tripod</strong></p>
<p>It’s critical to keep your phone as steady as possible when filming in Super Slow-mo since shaking might conflict with your video and hinder it from recognizing motions when set to auto-record. To get the most out of Super Slow-mo, we recommend using a tripod whenever feasible.</p>
<p><em>You can check these</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><em>tripods for iPhone</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Transition Between Single and Multi-Takes</strong></p>
<p>To boost your chances of catching the ideal timing in Super Slow-mo, your phone allows you to record in Multi-Take mode, which can capture many bursts of Super Slow-mo in one video.</p>
<p>When combined with an auto record, additional Super Slow-mo videos will be captured as much as the focus box senses activity and will end only when you end filming. The manual record works similarly. However, you’ll have to physically hit the trigger each time you wish to record a picture in Super Slow-mo.</p>
<p>As the name indicates, Single-Take will record a single Super Slow-mo clip and then cease recording a moment or two later. Because Multi-Take clips are often more extensive, this could save a large storage capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Readjust the Focus</strong></p>
<p>The focus or auto-recording is tiny by default. Fortunately, you can enlarge it to improve its odds of recognizing movement. To adjust the size of the box, hold it until only its edges are visible, then move any corner from the others to expand the box’s area. Simply tap anywhere outside the borders to verify the adjustment when you’re happy with the size.</p>
<p><strong>Capture in Natural Light</strong></p>
<p>Because of the large number of frames it collects, Super Slow-mo works the best in natural daylight situations.

<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Slow-Mo-and-Super-Slow-Mo-3"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Slow-Mo-and-Super-Slow-Mo-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Difference Between Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Difference Between Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo?</h2><p>Super Slow-Mo (960fps) is a technology that allows users to shoot films at 960fps using a top-speed lens, capturing events that the naked eye cannot ordinarily notice by viewing them 32 times slower than regular videos (30fps) and four times slower than videos produced using the current Slow Motion feature (240fps).</p>
<p>Super Slow-mo movie may be displayed as 6-12 sec long on old smartphones, such as Galaxy S9&#x2F;S9+ and Note9. However, the newer versions, such as Galaxy S10 Series, can play super slow-mo movies up to 14.8 sec.</p>
<p>You’ll understand the difference between the Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo better after reading the below information:</p>
<p><strong>Slow Motion</strong></p>
<p> Video is produced at an 8-times slower rate than usual, equivalent to the speed of a movie, advertisement, or sporting event.</p>
<p><strong>Super Slow Motion</strong></p>
<p>Videos are played 32 times slower than usual, catching minute changes in facial gestures and fast-moving elements.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-Super-Slo-Mo-Videos-with-Samsung-Galaxy-S20-and-Later-models-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-Super-Slo-Mo-Videos-with-Samsung-Galaxy-S20-and-Later-models-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Record Super Slo-Mo Videos with Samsung Galaxy S20 and Later models?"></a>Part 2: How to Record Super Slo-Mo Videos with Samsung Galaxy S20 and Later models?</h2><p><strong>Models That Support Super Slow-Mo:</strong> Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20+, Galaxy S20+ Ultra, Galaxy Z Flip, and later models.</p>
<p>Slow-motion video is often created by filming at a fast frame per second (fps) speed and then playing back at a far slower pace. This results in intriguing videos with slowed-down motion. The event is captured at 960 frames per second with the Super Slow-mo function, four times quicker than conventional slow motion. When it’s replayed at 30 frames per second, it’s 32 times slower, making mundane moments appear spectacular.</p>
<p>To capture super slow-motion videos with your Samsung Galaxy S20 and later models, follow the instructions below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the camera on your phone by tapping the <strong>Camera</strong> app.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, click on the <strong>Super Slow-Mo</strong> option to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Press the <strong>White Circle</strong> in the center to start the recording and press it again to stop when you are done.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that your phone’s video resolution is already on HD because Super Slow-Mo only supports HD resolutions.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Edit-Super-Slow-Motion-Video-in-Samsung-Galaxy-S21-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Edit-Super-Slow-Motion-Video-in-Samsung-Galaxy-S21-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Edit Super Slow Motion Video in Samsung Galaxy S21?"></a>Part 3: How to Edit Super Slow Motion Video in Samsung Galaxy S21?</h2><p>Only capturing the super slow-motion videos is not enough, especially if you are a content creator. Even in the super slow-mo, there might be some unnecessary parts (since it is more detailed) that you need to cut out or the parts that need some enhancements to make the video look captivating.</p>
<p>However, not every phone is eligible to edit super slow-mo videos by not degrading the video resolutions. But Samsung Galaxy S21 allows you to do that by keeping the video resolution intact. You can edit the Super Slow-Mo videos with Galaxy S21 by following these instructions:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app and navigate the super slow-mo video you wish to edit.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, play it and tap the screen. You will see <strong>three vertical dots</strong> in the right corner. Click on them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the <strong>Editor</strong> option from the dropdown menu that appears.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After that, you can adjust the length, crop the video, add effects, add stickers, add music, etc., by selecting from the bottom menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you’re done editing, click on the <strong>Save</strong> option at the top to save the video to your <strong>Gallery</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Record-Super-Slow-Motion-Video-with-Huawei-Mate-20-and-Later-Phones-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Record-Super-Slow-Motion-Video-with-Huawei-Mate-20-and-Later-Phones-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Record Super Slow Motion Video with Huawei Mate 20 and Later Phones?"></a>Part 4: How to Record Super Slow Motion Video with Huawei Mate 20 and Later Phones?</h2><p><strong>Models That Support Super Slow-Mo:</strong> Huawei Mate 20&#x2F;20 Pro&#x2F;20 X and later Mate models.</p>
<p>Before we demonstrate how to capture a super slow-mo with a Huawei Mate 20 and later models, we’ll explain this popular capture mode.</p>
<p>To begin, you should be aware that a camera&#x2F;camera sensor collects a specific number of frames per second. The movie becomes legible by combining these pictures; the more images there are, the more fluent the video will be. The naked eye is thought to decipher about 60 pictures every second.</p>
<p>The benefit of improved camera sensors is that you can capture a maximum number of photos per second (some smartphones can record up to 960 &#x2F; second) and slow down the sampling rate to produce a super slow-motion effect on the Huawei Mate 20 or later models.</p>
<p>Now, follow the stepwise guide to record super slow-mo with Huawei Mate 40 or later models:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your phone’s <strong>Camera</strong> go to <strong>More</strong> to select the <strong>Slow-Mo</strong> option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> By default, you will see 4x on the slow-mo capture mode, which means the video will be recorded at 120FPS. Huawei Mate 40 allows you to capture up to 128X, i.e, 3840FPS for fast moving objects. To enable the <strong>Super Slo-Mo</strong> feature, select the <strong>32X or 128X</strong> in this mode.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the <strong>Circle</strong> in the center to start and stop the recording. The video will be saved in your <strong>Gallery</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Shoot-Slo-Mo-Videos-on-iPhone-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Shoot-Slo-Mo-Videos-on-iPhone-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Shoot Slo-Mo Videos on iPhone?"></a>Part 5: How to Shoot Slo-Mo Videos on iPhone?</h2><p>Slow-motion film on your iPhone essentially means slowing the fps so that everything appears to move slower inside the video. It is a popular effect employed by artists to produce one-of-a-kind video clips of sports footage, natural scenes, or sequences with a lot of dramatic motion.</p>
<p>Slow-motion films are supported by all iPhones, beginning with the 5S model, and the capability gets more robust and more stable with each successive generation. Shooting slow-motion films with your iPhone are addicting and enjoyable, and it adds drama to various settings.</p>
<p>Here is a step-by-step method for filming slow-mo with an iPhone, regardless of model.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone and go to the <strong>Slow-Mo</strong> effect by sliding from the options above. Change the frame rate on the upper right corner to 120, 240, 720, depending on the iPhone models you’re using.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, start the recording by clicking the <strong>Red Circle</strong> in the center or either of the <strong>Volume</strong> button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After you’re done recording, press the <strong>Red Circle</strong> again and head towards the <strong>Gallery</strong> to view the recorded video.</p>

But don’t worry, with the following tips, we have got you covered:</p>
<p><strong>Utilize A Tripod</strong></p>
<p>It’s critical to keep your phone as steady as possible when filming in Super Slow-mo since shaking might conflict with your video and hinder it from recognizing motions when set to auto-record. To get the most out of Super Slow-mo, we recommend using a tripod whenever feasible.</p>
<p><em>You can check these</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><em>tripods for iPhone</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Transition Between Single and Multi-Takes</strong></p>
<p>To boost your chances of catching the ideal timing in Super Slow-mo, your phone allows you to record in Multi-Take mode, which can capture many bursts of Super Slow-mo in one video.</p>
<p>When combined with an auto record, additional Super Slow-mo videos will be captured as much as the focus box senses activity and will end only when you end filming. The manual record works similarly. However, you’ll have to physically hit the trigger each time you wish to record a picture in Super Slow-mo.</p>
<p>As the name indicates, Single-Take will record a single Super Slow-mo clip and then cease recording a moment or two later. Because Multi-Take clips are often more extensive, this could save a large storage capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Readjust the Focus</strong></p>
<p>The focus or auto-recording is tiny by default. Fortunately, you can enlarge it to improve its odds of recognizing movement. To adjust the size of the box, hold it until only its edges are visible, then move any corner from the others to expand the box’s area. Simply tap anywhere outside the borders to verify the adjustment when you’re happy with the size.</p>
<p><strong>Capture in Natural Light</strong></p>
<p>Because of the large number of frames it collects, Super Slow-mo works the best in natural daylight situations. Though not visible to the human eye, indoor lighting, especially LED bulbs and tiny fluorescents, seems to flash at very high rates. Even if the environment is well-lit, Super Slow-mo detects this and shows your subject in a substantially darker tone.</p>
<p><strong>View the Video at Normal Speed</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to watch your Super Slow-mo movies at regular speed, deactivate Super Slow-mo playing by tapping on the option directly below the video. This will give you a greater understanding of your phone’s incredible capacity to bring the world to a halt.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><strong>Super Slow Motion</strong> videos are excellent for showcasing the action and conveying tales, and they are also entertaining and straightforward to create. Your only constraints are time and imagination. However, your Android or iPhone’s camera has many more tricks in its sleeve: Live images, time-lapse, Panoramas, and Portrait mode let you express yourself freely!</p>

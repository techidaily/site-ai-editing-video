Many gamers consider it a revolutionized application that solves all their worries making gaming communication bigger and better. Before Discord, gaming communication was difficult and dangerous.

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>It rarely includes ads in private chats:</strong> A platform can become frustrating, mainly when it features multiple ads every minute. However, Discord is different since it almost has no ads. Therefore, people can freely chat with friends and other gamers.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Discord is safe:</strong> The settings under Discord are safe since they include suitable privacy options and monitoring. Thus, it is a safe option. But many people often raise the question of open chatting in apps and the security issues that come with them. Many people can confirm that Discord is a safe option and if you feel otherwise, ensure that you only add friends you know.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Discord-Emojis"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Discord-Emojis" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?"></a>Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?</h2><p>From the information above, you can tell that Discord’s primary role is communication.

<p><strong>Importance of Discord emojis</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Emojis help you to communicate the right emotions</strong>. Sometimes, it’s impossible to express the right feelings using words, and emojis come to the rescue in such situations. Of course, they are useless for formal communication, but Discord holds a considerable weight for various issues.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>They are fun and exciting</strong>. Sometimes you can choose to use an emoji instead of writing some phrase, and this option works for all. Besides, it feels good to see different emojis instead of a long paragraph that tells the same story.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Emojis make communication easy</strong>. We are in the 21st century with multiple revolutionary changes with our communication channels. Young people prefer emojis for different conversations.</p>

<p>Discord features multiple good points that explain why most people love it, including the <strong>avatar Discord GIF.</strong> However, many people still question its popularity and its rise recently. As a result, this section will answer this question using relevant facts.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>It is suitable for gaming communication:</strong> Discord is primarily popular among gamers. The platform is new, but it has quickly overtaken its competitors, Skype and TeamSpeak. Why? Many gamers consider it a revolutionized application that solves all their worries making gaming communication bigger and better. Before Discord, gaming communication was difficult and dangerous. After all, you need to share personal Skype details that connect with your phone, making it a not-safe option. When we consider TeamSpeak, you realize that it is limiting with the option available since you only have a voice call. Discord brings out the best network channel; gamers and friends have quickly started using it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Most services are free: Discord includes multiple benefits that make</strong> communication straightforward and convenient. Luckily, most of the services available are free, meaning that almost everyone can access them. As a result, many people would quickly settle for Discord compared to other platforms since you can get so much at no cost. Currently, they have the <strong>Discord Nitro gif avatar</strong>, which is affordable and multiplies the fun.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create Discord bots are no cost:</strong> Discord allows users to create bots for free without including any hosting fee hence an affordable option.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Constant updates that match the audiences’ needs: Things change in no time for Discord</strong>. Why? The developers are active and listen to the community’s opinion of what they want and why they need it. Therefore, it delivers the show that people urgently need leading to popularity rise.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>It rarely includes ads in private chats:</strong> A platform can become frustrating, mainly when it features multiple ads every minute. However, Discord is different since it almost has no ads. Therefore, people can freely chat with friends and other gamers.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Discord is safe:</strong> The settings under Discord are safe since they include suitable privacy options and monitoring. Thus, it is a safe option. But many people often raise the question of open chatting in apps and the security issues that come with them. Many people can confirm that Discord is a safe option and if you feel otherwise, ensure that you only add friends you know.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Discord-Emojis-3"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Discord-Emojis-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?"></a>Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?</h2><p>From the information above, you can tell that Discord’s primary role is communication.

The same case happens for Discord emojis. They are there to make communication appealing, interesting, funny and reveal how you feel about a situation.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of Discord emojis</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Emojis help you to communicate the right emotions</strong>. Sometimes, it’s impossible to express the right feelings using words, and emojis come to the rescue in such situations. Of course, they are useless for formal communication, but Discord holds a considerable weight for various issues.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>They are fun and exciting</strong>. Sometimes you can choose to use an emoji instead of writing some phrase, and this option works for all. Besides, it feels good to see different emojis instead of a long paragraph that tells the same story.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Emojis make communication easy</strong>. We are in the 21st century with multiple revolutionary changes with our communication channels. Young people prefer emojis for different conversations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>It offers a sense of presence in a conversation</strong>. People believed that they could only hold exciting discussions when they were together.

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>They liven up a serious conversation</strong>. Have you ever noticed, people tend to include emojis when having serious talks making them more casual and creating a friendly environment that suits everyone? And this trick often works.</p>

Here, we will be helping you find the best way to create animated videos for your particular project.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that there are very many animation programs in the market and choosing the best one will depend on your needs, your style, the feature and tools you need, the cost of the program, and even the export options that each tool gives you.</p>
<p>Before we look at the best ways to create animated videos, let’s start by examining why you would need to use an animated video maker in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="When-to-Use-an-Animated-Video-Maker"><a href="#When-to-Use-an-Animated-Video-Maker" class="headerlink" title="When to Use an Animated Video Maker"></a>When to Use an Animated Video Maker</h2><p>There are several reasons why you would want to create an animated video, rather than use traditional video solutions. The following are the most important from a digital marketing standpoint;</p>
<p><strong>Improve Conversion and Sales</strong></p>
<p>Animated videos are engaging enough to improve your conversion and sales. Studies have shown that an animated video can increase both conversion and sales by up to 80%. It may therefore be a good idea to use an animated explainer video to show your potential customers how to purchase a product or service on your website.</p>
<p><strong>Increase Brand Awareness</strong></p>
<p>Because they can be very entertaining and engaging, animated videos can also be a great way to increase brand awareness. And since they can be created very easily and cheaply, they can be a good way to reach potential customers.</p>
<p><strong>Generate Online Leads</strong></p>
<p>Because of the engaging nature of animated videos, you can use them to introduce yourself to potential customers and generate online leads. They have a very high conversion rate, as we have seen before, making them one of the best ways to reach people who would otherwise have never heard of you and your brand.</p>
<p><strong>Explain Complex Processes</strong></p>
<p>It can be very difficult to try to explain very complex ideas such as the mechanical aspect of a certain tool using words. But a well-crafted animated video gives you the chance to explain complex ideas in a fun and engaging way, making it easier for your customers to understand and engage with your brand.</p>

<h2 id="Keyframes-Interval-Everything-You-Need-To-Know"><a href="#Keyframes-Interval-Everything-You-Need-To-Know" class="headerlink" title="Keyframes Interval: Everything You Need To Know"></a>Keyframes Interval: Everything You Need To Know</h2><p>Many people may not understand what the <strong>Keyframe Interval</strong> stands for. However, it is a simple concept for video editors where the encoding settings determine the frequency at which the whole picture is transmitted.</p>
<p>The <strong>Keyframe Interval</strong> is responsible for how often a keyframe is generated within the video. A keyframe, also known as an i-frame, is a single frame that contains all of the necessary information for displaying a video. If the Keyframe Interval is set too high, it could lead to visible compression without compromising the quality of a video.</p>
<p><strong>Keyframe Interval</strong> is essential in video streaming and recording, but it can be confusing. In this guide, we’ll help you understand this concept to enable you to create better animations.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Keyframe-Interval"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Keyframe-Interval" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Keyframe Interval"></a>Part 1. What Is Keyframe Interval</h2><p>Keyframe Intervals, also known as “Keyframe Frequency” in Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder (FMLE) and vMix or “GOP size” by some encoders, is the frequency at which keyframes are generated in an animated sequence. This is an important parameter to consider when creating animations, as it can impact the animation’s file size, quality, and smoothness.</p>
<p>Keyframe Intervals are the distance in time between two keyframes. For example, if an animation is set to every 2 seconds interval and the frame rate is 30 per second, it means that every 60 frames, a keyframe is created.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Keyframe-Interval-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Keyframe-Interval-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Does Keyframe Interval Work?"></a>Part 2. How Does Keyframe Interval Work?</h2><p>Keyframes are important in video and animation because they mark specific points in time that can be used to create a smooth and consistent transition between different states or images. The Keyframe Interval is the amount of time that passes between two keyframes.</p>
<p>In order to create a smooth and consistent transition, the Keyframe Interval must be carefully calculated. In a 60-frame-per-second video, a keyframe is recorded every 5 or 300 frames. Delta frames are “difference” frames that provide an incremental change from the previous frame.</p>
<p>Keyframes are different from delta frames in that a higher keyframe value results in a clearer video with fewer transmission artifacts and vice versa.</p>
<p>The Keyframe Interval can be adjusted to create a faster or slower transition between two keyframes. A shorter Keyframe Interval will create a faster transition, while a longer one will create a slower transition.</p>
<p>For example, if you want your transition to look smoother, use a longer interval, like two seconds. Conversely, a zoom effect over a 0.2-second interval will be quicker.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-A-concept-closely-connected-to-Keyframe-Interval-Bitrates"><a href="#Part-3-A-concept-closely-connected-to-Keyframe-Interval-Bitrates" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. A concept closely connected to Keyframe Interval - Bitrates"></a>Part 3. A concept closely connected to Keyframe Interval - Bitrates</h2><p>The relationship between keyframes and bitrates is important to understand when creating video content. Keyframes are the frames in a video that are used to define the start and end points of an encoding process. The bitrate measures how much information is being transferred in a given time from one place to another.</p>
<p>When encoding video, keyframes are used to establish a consistent quality throughout the video. The bitrate is then used to determine how much information can be transferred without affecting the quality of the video. Thus, the higher the video’s bitrate, the better the quality.</p>
<p>Your mileage may vary regarding this explanation, as different encoders manage bitrates and keyframes in different ways.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re using an encoder like Wirecast, you might notice that broadcasting in a still background with someone talking results in a higher quality video as compared to a moving background. This can be reproduced using the same average bitrate and Keyframe Interval between them.</p>
<p>This happens because the delta frames have to share a lot more information to share in each frame in the video with a moving background. When you have an encoder like Wirecast, it’s working to keep your stream at an average bitrate. This can result in reduced quality if there is a lot of extra information in the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/delta-frame#:~:text=In%20interframe%20video%20coding%2C%20a,%2Dframes%20or%20B%2Dframes." >delta frames. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

What You Need To Know To Set A Right Keyframe Interval</h2><p>After understanding the important concepts in video editing, let’s see how to set the keyframe level in our videos appropriately.</p>
<p>Most streaming services will automatically set it for you based on your stream’s frame rate and bitrate. However, if you want to set the keyframe gap manually, there are a few things you need to keep in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the frame interval at 2 seconds. Do not increase it from 4 seconds.</li>
<li>Disable the “auto” keyframe feature.</li>
<li>To allow for b-frames, use an encoding profile higher than baseline and use IDR-based keyframes.</li>
</ul>

How To Change The Keyframe Interval On OBS Studio"></a>Part 5. How To Change The Keyframe Interval On OBS Studio</h2><p>Above is the basic knowledge of the keyframe interval. Then, how to apply it to your real video-editing work? In this part, we will choose OBS to show you the application process.</p>
<p>OBS Studio is a powerful yet free and open-source screen recorder and live streaming tool for Windows, macOS, and Linux. One of the most useful features of OBS Studio is its ability to change the keyframe interval on the fly without having to restart your recording or stream.</p>
<p>The process for changing the it in OBS Studio has been made more efficient since the classic version. However, some users may have trouble locating the new setting.</p>
<p>Here’s how to change the it on OBS Studio:</p>
<p>Step1 Launch the <strong>OBS Studio</strong> on your PC or laptop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="launching the obs studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 From the bottom right of the screen, open the <strong>“Settings”</strong> menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="obs studio settings menu"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 On the Settings Window, click <strong>“Output”</strong> and configure the output mode to <strong>“Advanced.”</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="setting the output mode to advance in obs studio"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Finally, edit the <strong>Keyframe Interval,</strong> set it to <strong>2</strong> seconds, and click <strong>“OK”</strong> to save your changes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h2 id="Part-6-Will-Keyframe-Interval-Affect-Your-Video’s-Quality"><a href="#Part-6-Will-Keyframe-Interval-Affect-Your-Video’s-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Part 6. Will Keyframe Interval Affect Your Video’s Quality?"></a>Part 6. Will Keyframe Interval Affect Your Video’s Quality?</h2><p>When you try to set the keyframe gap by yourself, you may feel confused about the difference a higher or lower interval make to your video. Then, wil-l or how it affects your video’s performance?</p>
<p>In a stream, it determines the balance between smoothness and picture quality. A keyframe is a point that determines how often the entire frame is sent, as opposed to just the differences from the previous frame.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you set the Keyframe Interval higher, your video will be more stable with fewer artifacts but requires more bandwidth and processing power. Conversely, a lower Keyframe Interval value causes more artifacts but is less resource intensive.</p>
<p>A lower Keyframe Interval value will result in lower video quality, while a higher keyframe value will result in higher video quality. However, the optimal Keyframe Interval value can vary depending on the specific case.</p>
<p>For instance, you don’t need a higher Keyframe Interval for streaming a live video, but you have to use a higher Key Interval value for recording.</p>

<p>02 <a href="#part2">Bonus! Free Distortion Effects for Premiere Pro</a></p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro offers a wide variety of beneficial editing tools and effects. Below are some of the impressive distortion effects you’ll find in Premiere Pro and how to use them in your project.</p>
<h4 id="1-Corner-Pin-Effect"><a href="#1-Corner-Pin-Effect" class="headerlink" title="1. Corner Pin Effect"></a>1. Corner Pin Effect</h4><p>This effect distorts your image by simply changing the position of its corners. You can use the Corner pin effect to twist, skew, shrink, or stretch an image. Additionally, you can use it to simulate movement or perspective pivoting from the edge of your clip like a door opening.</p>
<p>You can directly manipulate the properties of the Corner Pin effect in the Program monitor by clicking the Transform right next to Corner Pin. To adjust the properties, drag one of the corner handles.</p>
<ol>
<li>To use this effect, open Premiere Pro and click File. Choose Import from the drop-down menu. The File Explorer window will open and allow you to find your footage. Select the video file you want to import, then click Open.</li>
<li>Go to Effects Control and click Distortion. Choose Corner Pin Effect from the drop-down menu.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="2-Lens-Distortion-Effect"><a href="#2-Lens-Distortion-Effect" class="headerlink" title="2. Lens Distortion Effect"></a>2. Lens Distortion Effect</h4><p>This distortion effect Premiere Pro simulates the distorted lens through which people view the clip.</p>
<p>1. Go to Effects Control&gt;Distortion&gt;Lens Distortion Effect.</p>
<p>2. Choose the settings you want to use from the available options and adjust the slider.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Vertical and Horizontal Decentering control displaces the lens’ focal and makes the image bend and smear. The image will wrap in on itself at extreme settings.</li>
<li>The Curvature setting alters the curvature of the lens. You can specify a positive value to make the image convex, while the negative value makes the image concave.</li>
<li>The Vertical and Horizontal Prism FX setting created results similar to horizontal decentering and vertical, but the image does not wrap in on itself at extreme values.</li>
<li>Use the Fill Color option to specify the background color, and Fill Alpha to make your background transparent.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="3-Magnify-Effect"><a href="#3-Magnify-Effect" class="headerlink" title="3. Magnify Effect"></a>3. Magnify Effect</h4><p>This effect allows you to enlarge a selected area of your clip. The Magnify effect acts as a magnifying glass set over an area of an image. You can also use this effect to scale the whole image far beyond 100 percent and still maintain resolution.</p>
<p>1. To use this effect, go to Effect Control&gt;Distortion&gt;Magnify.</p>
<p>2. Next, go to the left side of the Effects Control panel and make the necessary adjustments to suit your preferences.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shape: This control specifies the magnified area shape.</li>
<li>Center: The Center control allows you to specify the center of the magnified section.</li>
<li>Magnification: This setting lets users specify the percentage of the magnification of the area they have selected, while the values represent the scale percentage.</li>
<li>Link: The Link control allows you to specify how the effect will link the Size, Feather, and Magnification amount, to enable them to decrease or increase proportionally. You will disable the Resize Layer option if you set the Link control to any of the available settings except None. Setting the Link control to any setting except None disables Resize Layer. Size &amp; Feather To Magnification allows you to specify that the edge feather and size of the magnified section decrease or increase proportionally regarding the magnification adjustment.</li>
<li>Size: This control allows you to specify the magnified area size in pixels.</li>
<li>Feather: With the Feather option, you can specify the amount of feather the effect applies to the magnified area edge. Lower values will sharpen the edge. Higher values will soften the edge while blending the edge with the layer that’s behind it.</li>
<li>Opacity: This control allows you to specify the transparency of the magnified region.</li>
<li>Scaling: Use this option to specify the kind of scaling the effect is using to magnify an image.</li>
<li>Blending Mode: Use this control to specify the blend mode the effect will use to combine the original clip with the magnified area. The None option shows transparent pixels around the magnified section.</li>
<li>Resize Layer: Selecting this option means the effect will only use the boundaries as the clip’s edge when the magnified region extends beyond the original boundaries of the clip. Deselecting the Resize Layer means that the boundaries of the clip will crop any area of your image outside the bounding box of the original clip.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="4-Mirror-Effect"><a href="#4-Mirror-Effect" class="headerlink" title="4. Mirror Effect"></a>4. Mirror Effect</h4><p>This distortion Premiere Pro effect splits an image along a line while reflecting one side onto the other. Where the reflection appears and which side will be reflected is determined by the reflection angles.</p>
<p>1. Head over to Effect Control&gt;Distortion&gt;Mirror to use this effect.</p>
<p>2. Adjust the controls until you get the results you desire.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflection Angle: With the Reflection Angle control, you can specify the angle of reflection and where it appears on the clip. A zero-degree angle reflects the left-hand side on the right.</li>
<li>Reflection Center: This control allows you to specify the position of the line. You need to click the box, then drag the resulting crosshair up to the area in the image where you would like to place the line.</li>

<p>1. Go to Effects Control&gt;Distortion&gt;Lens Distortion Effect.</p>
<p>2. Choose the settings you want to use from the available options and adjust the slider.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Vertical and Horizontal Decentering control displaces the lens’ focal and makes the image bend and smear. The image will wrap in on itself at extreme settings.</li>
<li>The Curvature setting alters the curvature of the lens. You can specify a positive value to make the image convex, while the negative value makes the image concave.</li>
<li>The Vertical and Horizontal Prism FX setting created results similar to horizontal decentering and vertical, but the image does not wrap in on itself at extreme values.</li>
<li>Use the Fill Color option to specify the background color, and Fill Alpha to make your background transparent.</li>

The Magnify effect acts as a magnifying glass set over an area of an image. You can also use this effect to scale the whole image far beyond 100 percent and still maintain resolution.</p>
<p>1. To use this effect, go to Effect Control&gt;Distortion&gt;Magnify.</p>
<p>2. Next, go to the left side of the Effects Control panel and make the necessary adjustments to suit your preferences.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shape: This control specifies the magnified area shape.</li>
<li>Center: The Center control allows you to specify the center of the magnified section.</li>
<li>Magnification: This setting lets users specify the percentage of the magnification of the area they have selected, while the values represent the scale percentage.</li>
<li>Link: The Link control allows you to specify how the effect will link the Size, Feather, and Magnification amount, to enable them to decrease or increase proportionally. You will disable the Resize Layer option if you set the Link control to any of the available settings except None. Setting the Link control to any setting except None disables Resize Layer. Size &amp; Feather To Magnification allows you to specify that the edge feather and size of the magnified section decrease or increase proportionally regarding the magnification adjustment.</li>
<li>Size: This control allows you to specify the magnified area size in pixels.</li>
<li>Feather: With the Feather option, you can specify the amount of feather the effect applies to the magnified area edge. Lower values will sharpen the edge. Higher values will soften the edge while blending the edge with the layer that’s behind it.</li>
<li>Opacity: This control allows you to specify the transparency of the magnified region.</li>
<li>Scaling: Use this option to specify the kind of scaling the effect is using to magnify an image.</li>
<li>Blending Mode: Use this control to specify the blend mode the effect will use to combine the original clip with the magnified area. The None option shows transparent pixels around the magnified section.</li>
<li>Resize Layer: Selecting this option means the effect will only use the boundaries as the clip’s edge when the magnified region extends beyond the original boundaries of the clip. Deselecting the Resize Layer means that the boundaries of the clip will crop any area of your image outside the bounding box of the original clip.</li>
</ul>

<li>Scaling: Use this option to specify the kind of scaling the effect is using to magnify an image.</li>
<li>Blending Mode: Use this control to specify the blend mode the effect will use to combine the original clip with the magnified area. The None option shows transparent pixels around the magnified section.</li>
<li>Resize Layer: Selecting this option means the effect will only use the boundaries as the clip’s edge when the magnified region extends beyond the original boundaries of the clip. Deselecting the Resize Layer means that the boundaries of the clip will crop any area of your image outside the bounding box of the original clip.</li>

However, this method won’t add the SRT file permanently to your videos.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can add subtitles in the VLC media player on your video clip:</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder.

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

But you don’t have to worry about it anymore let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>What are you planning to use it for?</strong>: You must know the use of video editing software before picking one. Whether you are using it for gaming or creating ordinary YouTube videos. These decisions are very important to take before opting for downloading it from the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Learning curve</strong>: You should keep in mind which editing software is complex to learn and which one is easy in comparison with that. If you didn’t keep this in mind you might end up wasting your time by downloading and trying in vain.</p>
<p><strong>Quality</strong>: Another important factor to consider in video editing software is the quality and format of the video. There are many formats and quality of video content, therefore it is important to choose the one which supports your video format.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong>: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor that should have all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.</p>
<p><strong>Compatability</strong>: The most important point is whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you have heard the name from your friend. Consult the internet for compatibility of the software by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.</p>

<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p><strong>Compatability</strong>: The most important point is whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you have heard the name from your friend. Consult the internet for compatibility of the software by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>
<p>5. Video editing tools: You have to edit your recorded video to trim out unnecessary parts and add effects and filters to enhance your video content and video quality. Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.</p>
<p>6. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.</p>
<h2 id="Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks-2"><a href="#Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks</h2><p>1. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder.

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>This article will dive into how you can access the modern-day features available in video editing software. From these features, you can alter the speed of your video easily. However, before we get into the step-by-step guide, let’s understand what fast and slow-mo videos are.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Similarly, slow-motion videos are the ones that have been slowed down from their average speed. The slow-motion effect, also known as the slow-mo effect, is widespread in modern cinema.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

Why Should You Change the Speed of Your Videos?"></a>Part 2. Why Should You Change the Speed of Your Videos?</h2><p>The answer to this question would be that it’s a personal creative decision that will allow you to make your videos more engaging.</p>
<h3 id="Fast-Motion-Videos"><a href="#Fast-Motion-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Fast Motion Videos"></a>Fast Motion Videos</h3><p>Fast-motion videos are used in many areas of filming. For example, you can speed up your videos to create a funny video or shorten its length.</p>
<p>The fast-motion effect has many applications, such as cooking tutorial videos. For example, the step-by-step process of a cooking tutorial can be too long to fit into a single video. Or it could also help you in cases where you want to keep the length of the video short.</p>
<p>The fast motion of the steps will allow the viewer to quickly grasp the whole process without watching the entire video.</p>
<h3 id="Slow-Motion-Videos"><a href="#Slow-Motion-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Slow Motion Videos"></a>Slow Motion Videos</h3><p>You can also slow down your videos to give the viewers a more detailed perspective of a scene. Or you can also create a slow-mo video that offers a general surreal vibe.</p>
<p>A famous example is in action films. The producers of the first <strong>Matrix</strong> film used the Slow-mo effect in the famous bullet dodging scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>You may wonder how the film producers made the slow-mo effect. The technology at that time was less developed than the recent day. So, even you can create a slow-mo effect.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Slowing down a video requires a shot at a higher frame rate. The greater the frame rate, the better will be the slow-mo quality. On the other hand, speeding up videos does not have a strict frame rate requirement.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-Can-You-Change-the-Speed-of-Your-Videos"><a href="#Part-4-How-Can-You-Change-the-Speed-of-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How Can You Change the Speed of Your Videos?"></a>Part 4. How Can You Change the Speed of Your Videos?</h2><p>Here you will learn two ways in which you can change the speed of your videos. The two methods to change the speed of your video are mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>The speed adjustment panel.</li>
<li>Duration panel settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get started with the editing process. The first method we will look into is the Speed Adjustment panel.</p>
<h3 id="1-Change-Speed-With-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel"><a href="#1-Change-Speed-With-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel" class="headerlink" title="1. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel"></a>1. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel</h3><p>The Speed Adjustment panel is the speed adjuster in the Wondershare Filmora software. This feature will give you a drag bar to adjust the speed of your video.</p>
<p>You can move the bar to the right to increase the speed of your video. Similarly, you can move it to the left to decrease the rate.</p>
<p>But before we use this feature, we will need to download the Filmora video editing software. So please scroll below to learn how to download it!</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Download-Filmora"><a href="#Step1-Download-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Download Filmora"></a>Step1 Download Filmora</h5><p>First and foremost, you must have access to Filmora. For this, download Wondershare Filmora. Then, activate this app or software on your PC.</p>
<h5 id="Step2-Import-The-Video-Files"><a href="#Step2-Import-The-Video-Files" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Import The Video Files"></a>Step2 Import The Video Files</h5><p>The next step after downloading Filmora is to import your video clips. To accomplish this, follow the steps outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate and select the <strong>Import</strong> icon on the top left side of the Filmora Home Interface.</li>
<li>It takes you to your computer’s library.</li>
<li>Select the videos to be edited and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="wondershare filmora importing video clips from pc directory"
                ></p>
<p>You can also import the files by another method. After you have opened Filmora, you can restore the Filmora Window size and import by dragging and dropping the clips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the cursor to select the video clips you want.</li>
<li>Then, drop them in the Filmora import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-6.png"
                      alt="import video clips by drag and drop"
                ></p>
<p>Filmora supports various formats for your video clips. They include the <strong>Mp4</strong>,   <strong>AVI</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>GIFs,</strong> and more.</p>
<p>After you have imported your video clips, add them to the timeline as shown below!</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-The-Timeline"><a href="#Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-The-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline"></a>Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline</h5><p>After you’ve imported clips in the Import window, drag them onto the timeline. Follow the steps outlined below to accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the clips into the import window and select them.</li>
<li>Then, <strong>insert</strong> them into the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora adding clips to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have our video clips in the timeline, we can start adjusting the speed.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Open-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel"><a href="#Step4-Open-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel"></a>Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel</h5><p>The speed adjustment panel, or the Uniform Speed, is the feature of Filmora that allows you to change the speed of your video. For example, to open the Unifrom Speed panel, do as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the <strong>pop-up</strong> column, scroll down till you see the <strong>Unifrom Speed</strong> option and click on it.</li>
<li>The speed controls will be shown in the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-8.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora unifrom speed tab"
                ></p>
<p>In the speed control panel, you can see the speed adjuster slider. A number will usually mark this at the end. This number tells you the current speed your video is calibrated in and how fast or slow the motion effects will be.</p>
<p><strong>1.00</strong> is always the average speed. <strong>0.5</strong> being half and <strong>2.00</strong> being double the average speed. To control the speed through the slider, you will need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To increase the speed:</strong> Type in the number you want your rate to be. Or, drag the slider to the right as you wish.</li>
<li><strong>To decrease the speed:</strong> Type in a number less than the standard 1.00, or you can drag the slider to the left as you wish.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of your speed can be an inconvenience if you have no prior experience. Instead, render the video and play it from the beginning with the changes that you made. It gives you a better idea of the speed of your video.</p>

<p>Wait till Wondershare Filmora finishes exporting your video. Then, another window will pop up for a reminder when the shipping is done.</p>
<p>These were the methods by which you can change the speed of your video using the Speed Adjustment panel. Now let’s move on to the following method to adjust the speed via the Duration panel.</p>
<h3 id="2-Change-Speed-via-the-Duration-Panel"><a href="#2-Change-Speed-via-the-Duration-Panel" class="headerlink" title="2. Change Speed via the Duration Panel"></a>2. Change Speed via the Duration Panel</h3><p>The duration panel is one the most valuable features of Wondershare Filmora as it allows you to change the video speed by duration adjustment.</p>
<p>This feature is typically helpful when you have a space between video clips and want to fill it. By measuring the time between the two clips, you can adjust the duration of your video.</p>
<p>It will ultimately hasten the speed of your video. The hastening in rate will depend upon the gap. The smaller the gap, the faster the video will be. Similarly, the greater the gap is, the longer the video will be.</p>
<p>Apart from the Speed Adjustment Panel, the Duration Panel has the advantage of editing the speed of your video by simply typing in the text.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Import-Video-Clips-to-Timeline"><a href="#Step1-Import-Video-Clips-to-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline"></a>Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline</h5><p>After downloading Filmora, the next step is importing your video clips. To do so, follow the steps outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate and click the <strong>Import</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the Filmora Home Interface.</li>
<li>Choose the videos to be edited, then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have imported files into Filmora, you can add them to the Timeline. Notice the steps mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag the clips into the import window and select them.</li>
<li>Then, insert them into the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can begin the editing process now that the clips are in the timeline.</p>
<h5 id="Step2-Open-The-Duration-Panel"><a href="#Step2-Open-The-Duration-Panel" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Open The Duration Panel"></a>Step2 Open The Duration Panel</h5><p>The Duration Panel comes attached to the <strong>Unifrom Speed Panel</strong>. To access the Duration Panel, follow the steps ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the pop column, scroll below to <strong>Unifrom Speed</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will open the uniform speed panel in the import window. Below the speed of the controls, you can notice The Duration Panel.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Change-The-Speed-of-The-Video"><a href="#Step3-Change-The-Speed-of-The-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Change The Speed of The Video"></a>Step3 Change The Speed of The Video</h5><p>In The Duration Panel, you can see the average speed of your video clip. Now, if you want to <strong>reduce</strong> the speed of your video, you have to <strong>increase</strong> the duration of your video. Similarly, if you’re going to <strong>increase</strong> the speed of your video, you would have to <strong>decrease</strong> the duration.</p>
<h5 id="Slow-Down-The-Video"><a href="#Slow-Down-The-Video" class="headerlink" title="Slow Down The Video"></a>Slow Down The Video</h5><p>To slow down the video clip, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>In The Duration Panel, <strong>Increase</strong> the time of the video.</li>
<li>Type in a number bigger than the normal value</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the average speed of the video is <strong>00:01:00:00,</strong> increasing the value of the duration to <strong>00:02:00:00</strong> will reduce the speed of your video by half.</p>
<p><img

<h5 id="Speed-Up-The-Video"><a href="#Speed-Up-The-Video" class="headerlink" title="Speed Up The Video"></a>Speed Up The Video</h5><p>To increase the speed of your video, follow as guided ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>In The Duration Panel, <strong>decrease</strong> the time of the video.</li>
<li>Type in a number smaller than the normal value</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the normal video speed is <strong>00:01:00:00,</strong> decreasing the value of the duration to <strong>00:00:30:00</strong> will increase the speed of your video by double.</p>

<h2 id="Part-4-How-Can-You-Change-the-Speed-of-Your-Videos-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-Can-You-Change-the-Speed-of-Your-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How Can You Change the Speed of Your Videos?"></a>Part 4. How Can You Change the Speed of Your Videos?</h2><p>Here you will learn two ways in which you can change the speed of your videos. The two methods to change the speed of your video are mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>The speed adjustment panel.</li>
<li>Duration panel settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get started with the editing process. The first method we will look into is the Speed Adjustment panel.</p>
<h3 id="1-Change-Speed-With-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel-1"><a href="#1-Change-Speed-With-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel"></a>1. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel</h3><p>The Speed Adjustment panel is the speed adjuster in the Wondershare Filmora software. This feature will give you a drag bar to adjust the speed of your video.</p>
<p>You can move the bar to the right to increase the speed of your video. Similarly, you can move it to the left to decrease the rate.</p>
<p>But before we use this feature, we will need to download the Filmora video editing software. So please scroll below to learn how to download it!</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Download-Filmora-1"><a href="#Step1-Download-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Download Filmora"></a>Step1 Download Filmora</h5><p>First and foremost, you must have access to Filmora. For this, download Wondershare Filmora. Then, activate this app or software on your PC.</p>
<h5 id="Step2-Import-The-Video-Files-1"><a href="#Step2-Import-The-Video-Files-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Import The Video Files"></a>Step2 Import The Video Files</h5><p>The next step after downloading Filmora is to import your video clips. To accomplish this, follow the steps outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate and select the <strong>Import</strong> icon on the top left side of the Filmora Home Interface.</li>
<li>It takes you to your computer’s library.</li>
<li>Select the videos to be edited and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora importing video clips from pc directory"
                ></p>
<p>You can also import the files by another method. After you have opened Filmora, you can restore the Filmora Window size and import by dragging and dropping the clips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the cursor to select the video clips you want.</li>
<li>Then, drop them in the Filmora import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-6.png"
                      alt="import video clips by drag and drop"
                ></p>
<p>Filmora supports various formats for your video clips. They include the <strong>Mp4</strong>,   <strong>AVI</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>GIFs,</strong> and more.</p>
<p>After you have imported your video clips, add them to the timeline as shown below!</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-The-Timeline-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-The-Timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline"></a>Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline</h5><p>After you’ve imported clips in the Import window, drag them onto the timeline. Follow the steps outlined below to accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the clips into the import window and select them.</li>
<li>Then, <strong>insert</strong> them into the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-7.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora adding clips to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have our video clips in the timeline, we can start adjusting the speed.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Open-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel-1"><a href="#Step4-Open-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel"></a>Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel</h5><p>The speed adjustment panel, or the Uniform Speed, is the feature of Filmora that allows you to change the speed of your video. For example, to open the Unifrom Speed panel, do as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the <strong>pop-up</strong> column, scroll down till you see the <strong>Unifrom Speed</strong> option and click on it.</li>
<li>The speed controls will be shown in the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-8.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora unifrom speed tab"
                ></p>
<p>In the speed control panel, you can see the speed adjuster slider. A number will usually mark this at the end. This number tells you the current speed your video is calibrated in and how fast or slow the motion effects will be.</p>
<p><strong>1.00</strong> is always the average speed. <strong>0.5</strong> being half and <strong>2.00</strong> being double the average speed. To control the speed through the slider, you will need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To increase the speed:</strong> Type in the number you want your rate to be. Or, drag the slider to the right as you wish.</li>
<li><strong>To decrease the speed:</strong> Type in a number less than the standard 1.00, or you can drag the slider to the left as you wish.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of your speed can be an inconvenience if you have no prior experience. Instead, render the video and play it from the beginning with the changes that you made. It gives you a better idea of the speed of your video.</p>

<h5 id="Step5-Detach-The-Audio-1"><a href="#Step5-Detach-The-Audio-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Detach The Audio"></a>Step5 Detach The Audio</h5><p>The corresponding audio also gets affected when you slow down or speed up a video. In this scenario, you can also choose to detach the audio beforehand. It allows you to maintain the original playback speed. To detach the audio, follow the steps as mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the pop-up column, scroll down to the <strong>Detach Audio</strong> option and click on it.</li>

                      alt="wondershare filmora detaching audio"
                ></p>

<li>A settings menu will open in the import window.</li>
<li>Adjust the <strong>Fade</strong> options for your Audio.</li>

                      alt="wondershare filmora adjusting detached audio"
                ></p>
<p>You can also remove the background noise and the pitch of the audio if you want. You can also replace the video’s original audio with a new one. Click on the audio file and press <strong>Del</strong> on the keyboard to delete it. To add new audio, do as mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on The <strong>Audio</strong> icon above the import window.</li>
<li>Browse The Audio that matches the vibe of your video.</li>
<li>Drag and drop it below your video clip.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="wondershare filmora adding custom audio"
                ></p>
<p>Doing so would have created alternate audio for your video. Play the video from the start and confirm your changes.</p>

<p>Wait till Wondershare Filmora finishes exporting your video. Then, another window will pop up for a reminder when the shipping is done.</p>
<p>These were the methods by which you can change the speed of your video using the Speed Adjustment panel. Now let’s move on to the following method to adjust the speed via the Duration panel.</p>
<h3 id="2-Change-Speed-via-the-Duration-Panel-1"><a href="#2-Change-Speed-via-the-Duration-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Change Speed via the Duration Panel"></a>2. Change Speed via the Duration Panel</h3><p>The duration panel is one the most valuable features of Wondershare Filmora as it allows you to change the video speed by duration adjustment.</p>
<p>This feature is typically helpful when you have a space between video clips and want to fill it. By measuring the time between the two clips, you can adjust the duration of your video.</p>
<p>It will ultimately hasten the speed of your video. The hastening in rate will depend upon the gap. The smaller the gap, the faster the video will be. Similarly, the greater the gap is, the longer the video will be.</p>
<p>Apart from the Speed Adjustment Panel, the Duration Panel has the advantage of editing the speed of your video by simply typing in the text.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Import-Video-Clips-to-Timeline-1"><a href="#Step1-Import-Video-Clips-to-Timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline"></a>Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline</h5><p>After downloading Filmora, the next step is importing your video clips. To do so, follow the steps outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate and click the <strong>Import</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the Filmora Home Interface.</li>
<li>Choose the videos to be edited, then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have imported files into Filmora, you can add them to the Timeline. Notice the steps mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag the clips into the import window and select them.</li>
<li>Then, insert them into the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can begin the editing process now that the clips are in the timeline.</p>
<h5 id="Step2-Open-The-Duration-Panel-1"><a href="#Step2-Open-The-Duration-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Open The Duration Panel"></a>Step2 Open The Duration Panel</h5><p>The Duration Panel comes attached to the <strong>Unifrom Speed Panel</strong>. To access the Duration Panel, follow the steps ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the pop column, scroll below to <strong>Unifrom Speed</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will open the uniform speed panel in the import window. Below the speed of the controls, you can notice The Duration Panel.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Change-The-Speed-of-The-Video-1"><a href="#Step3-Change-The-Speed-of-The-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Change The Speed of The Video"></a>Step3 Change The Speed of The Video</h5><p>In The Duration Panel, you can see the average speed of your video clip. Now, if you want to <strong>reduce</strong> the speed of your video, you have to <strong>increase</strong> the duration of your video. Similarly, if you’re going to <strong>increase</strong> the speed of your video, you would have to <strong>decrease</strong> the duration.</p>
<h5 id="Slow-Down-The-Video-1"><a href="#Slow-Down-The-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Slow Down The Video"></a>Slow Down The Video</h5><p>To slow down the video clip, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>In The Duration Panel, <strong>Increase</strong> the time of the video.</li>
<li>Type in a number bigger than the normal value</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the average speed of the video is <strong>00:01:00:00,</strong> increasing the value of the duration to <strong>00:02:00:00</strong> will reduce the speed of your video by half.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora adjusting slowing down the video"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Speed-Up-The-Video-1"><a href="#Speed-Up-The-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Speed Up The Video"></a>Speed Up The Video</h5><p>To increase the speed of your video, follow as guided ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>In The Duration Panel, <strong>decrease</strong> the time of the video.</li>
<li>Type in a number smaller than the normal value</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the normal video speed is <strong>00:01:00:00,</strong> decreasing the value of the duration to <strong>00:00:30:00</strong> will increase the speed of your video by double.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

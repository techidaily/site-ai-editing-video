Maybe you don’t need to modify the video because it is already in the correct setting.</p>
<p>So how do you do that in Premiere Pro?</p>
<ol>
<li>Import the video to Adobe Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Check the “Media” window. Next to the video file name is its frame rate. It is written in the format x.00 fps. FPS stands for “frames per second,” which is used interchangeably with the term frame rate.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Reasons-for-Changing-Frame-Rate"><a href="#Reasons-for-Changing-Frame-Rate" class="headerlink" title="Reasons for Changing Frame Rate"></a>Reasons for Changing Frame Rate</h2><p>Suppose you have an action-packed video. It would not look great at 30 fps - it will look too choppy. That will give your audience a rotten viewing experience. By increasing the frames, you can make the motion more fluid and smoother.</p>
<p>Increasing the frames per second also results in better slow-motion videos. A 30 fps one would not look good with this effect because it does not show smooth motion. Thus, we recommend making the video at least 60 fps.</p>
<p>However, a higher frame rate does not always mean better videos. It can result in what they call the “soap opera effect.” It means the video shows too many details. That makes the videos seem “unnatural” or less cinematic.</p>
<p>High frame rates make videos look more realistic since there is less stuttering and motion blur between frames. That’s great. But for older audiences - the ones used to watching videos at 24 fps, it can be off-putting. So it’s also important to consider your target audience when deciding the right frame rate for your video.</p>
<p>With these reasons in mind, you may want to change your video’s frame rate.</p>

Here’s a quick guide on how to change fps in Adobe Premiere Pro. This program gives you two different ways to change fps. One is changing the frame rate of a sequence; the other is changing the frame rate of the video clip. We will teach you how to do both.</p>
<h3 id="l-Change-the-Frame-Rate-of-a-Sequence"><a href="#l-Change-the-Frame-Rate-of-a-Sequence" class="headerlink" title="l Change the Frame Rate of a Sequence"></a>l Change the Frame Rate of a Sequence</h3><p>Suppose you want to keep the frame rate of most of the video the same. Only some parts need adjusting. You can change the frame rate of the sequences that need changing instead. Here are the steps to follow to achieve this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your project in Adobe Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>In the Project panel, select the sequence whose frame rate you want to change. Right-click on that sequence.</li>
<li>Choose “Sequence Settings” from the menu that appears.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Import your video clip to Premiere Pro and drag it to the timeline.</li>
<li>Go to the “Effects” tab. It’s in the options at the bottom left of the screen.</li>

<ol>
<li>Drag and drop the Posterize Time effect to the clip whose frame rate you want to change.</li>
<li>Click “Effect Controls” at the top left of the screen.</li>
<li>Select the small “arrow” button next to the “Frame Rate” text under “Posterize Time.”</li>
<li>Change the frame rate to your preferred setting. For example, type “60” to make the video 60 fps.</li>

If you are a gaming content creator on YouTube, you probably record videos at this frame rate. You’d want to edit that footage and export it at the same frame rate.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to do that. But it’s a little bit of a hidden feature. When creating a sequence, you may notice that the highest the frame rate can go is 60 frames per second. That’s obviously not the number that we want. Don’t worry. There is a workaround. The best thing is that it’s super easy.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to change your video to 120 fps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import your 120 fps video to Adobe Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Select your footage. Drag it to your timeline or the tab where the text says, “Drop media here to create sequence.”</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Select the timeline panel. Click “Sequence” &gt; “Sequence Settings.”</li>

It’s simple; in the 1950s, video-making technologies were slightly advanced, although films were more about rock and roll and poodle skirts. So, without further dilly-dallying, let’s learn how to create a retro 1950-style video with this simple Filmora tutorial.</p>

<p>Shooting a video to teleport yourself to the 1950s doesn’t need to be complicated. You simply need to look the part in the video. For example, you can wear velvet-collar jackets, stovepipe trousers, carefully combed back hair, and other trendy styles in the 50s. It’s even better if you can find those vintage chairs in your grandparent’s collection.</p>
<p>How to create a 1950s vintage film:</p>

<p>First, fire up Filmora and load the video you want to send back to the 1950s. Then, drag your footage onto the editing timeline.</p>

                      alt="apply a cropping effect to the video"
                ></p>
<p>Once the video is successfully added to Filmora, click the <strong>Effect</strong> tab on the top menu bar and choose the <strong>Crop</strong> effect under the <strong>Utility</strong> folder. Make sure you add the Crop effect two or three tracks above the original video track.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Double-click the Crop effect, then change the Left and Right values to make the video look like it was shot in the 50s. You can set the values as 10.</p>

<p>Up to here, you’ll realize that your video doesn’t still look like a 1950s film per se. Double-click your video clip and choose the <strong>3D LUT</strong> option under the <strong>Color</strong> category. Then, open the drop-down menu and choose <strong>Warm Film</strong>. This will make your video look like it was shot using an old camera.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Please don’t stop there; we want to make the footage slightly grainy. In other words, you need to make the footage have a lot of grain and low light. To do that, tap the <strong>Overlay</strong> menu under the Effects tab, then click <strong>Old Film</strong>. After that, choose the <strong>Random Dust, Dirty Film,</strong> and <strong>Subtle Grain</strong> effects and add them to the tracks above your video clip. Remember to use as much grain as possible to give your footage that vintage look of the 1950s.</p>

<p>Up to here, you’ll realize that your video doesn’t still look like a 1950s film per se.

<p>Please don’t stop there; we want to make the footage slightly grainy. In other words, you need to make the footage have a lot of grain and low light. To do that, tap the <strong>Overlay</strong> menu under the Effects tab, then click <strong>Old Film</strong>. After that, choose the <strong>Random Dust, Dirty Film,</strong> and <strong>Subtle Grain</strong> effects and add them to the tracks above your video clip. Remember to use as much grain as possible to give your footage that vintage look of the 1950s.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Include a Background Music</strong></p>
<p>To complement your <strong>Aquasoft Slideshow Ultimate</strong> presentation with a suitable background audio, visit the top toolbar and click on the ‘Add’ tab and select ‘Background Music’ from the list of options that appears next. A series of music titles will appear as you click on the ‘+’ icon in the ‘Background Music’ interface. You are allowed to reset the order of the listed music files through a mouse click.</p>
<p>If you want to remove the music titles, click on the ‘Trash Bin’ icon beside the ‘+’ button.

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Let’s Play!</strong></p>
<p>You can choose to play your slideshow at this stage with simple elements of images and music. All you need to do is, navigate to the ‘Menu Bar’ below the top toolbar and click on Play’ button. You can alternatively press the F9 key from your system’s keyboard to run the slideshow. The app works intelligently to supplement your presentation with random transition effects that play a new animation every time you run the slideshow.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the default arrangements, you can also proceed to make adjustments in the transition play duration and even customize a transition style of your own with text and effects.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6: Adjust Your Image Properties</strong></p>
<p>To proceed with making adjustments to specific image characteristics, select the desired image and its properties will appear at the right side. You can now work with assigning a particular transition, comments and text to the image, while also making adjustments to the image screen time.</p>
<p>For adhering to the concern of adjusting the play durations of several images in a single instant, select them in the ‘Image List’ through the ‘Ctrl+ A’ command from your system’s keyboard and enter a specific play duration. Your entry will be applied to all the selected images.</p>
<p>You can however, escape the 2-way process by navigating to the ‘Program Settings’ tab and adjusting the pre-set image play duration. Your changes will be applicable to all the slideshow images that have their ‘Use Default Duration’ option enabled.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Add Suitable Transitions</strong></p>
<p>If the randomly included transitions of the slideshow program do not suit your presentation style, choose to add your preferred one from the software’s ‘Transition Library’ and tap the ‘Adjust’ button to customise the properties of your selection. You can also click on the ‘Play’ icon in the ‘Menu Bar’ and run the slideshow from the current image to see how the applied transition appears over the image.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Text Customizations</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Images’ menu and hit the ‘Text’ tab to include text add-on within the slideshow images while formatting them suitably. You can further, add animations to the text and customize them to stay with or leave the text after the image play duration is over, by tapping the ‘Edit’ button. To present a combined play of text and image, while avoiding the separate text animation, click on the ‘Show Text with Image’ checkbox at the bottom right corner of the ‘Images’ menu.</p>

<p><strong>Step 9: Add Comments to the Images</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Sound’ tab and enable your system’s microphone to add recorded comments to your slideshow. Start with clicking on the ‘Record’ button and narrate the comment. Don’t worry about the sync of image and comment play durations as the software program will automatically adjust both to be in line with each other.</p>
<p>If you are interested to add a particular sound file to a specific image, navigate to the ‘Yellow Folder’ at the top right corner to make your selection.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11: Collage Creation</strong></p>
<p>Try hands at including a collage in your slideshow to play several numbers of images and texts within the same time frame. To do this, navigate to the ‘Object Toolbar’ at the bottom of the project timeline and select the ‘Collage’ object, followed by dragging the same to the ‘Image List’ to add the latter to your presentation. Once you are done with this, proceed to choose the desired images that you wish to add to the collage, succeeded by dragging the same to the ‘Collage’ object.</p>
<p>Move ahead with expanding the collage, to ensure a proper display of the images. You can further, apply selected transitions to the created collage under the latter’s ‘Object Settings’.</p>

<p><strong>Step 12: Edit Your Collage</strong></p>
<p>Start with selecting the first image of your collage and adjusting its size in the ‘Layout Designer’ through the position frame at the edges of the photo. Next, you can proceed with positioning the image at the desired place within the collage. Repeat the process till all the images in your collage are at their respective places and within the respective size ratio.</p>
<p>Move ahead with including a relevant text at the end of your collage by selecting the ‘Text’ object in the bottom toolbar. Navigate to the last image of your collage and tap on ‘Text’ object to include it within the last image. You can make suitable formatting adjustments to the added text in the ‘Text’ tab of the ‘Object Settings’. Position your text at the appropriate place within the image and check a preview of the same by clicking on the ‘Play’ button in the ‘Menu Bar’ above the project timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 13: Including a Chapter</strong></p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with a single image track, proceed to add chapters to your presentation. Start with selecting the ‘Chapter’ object from the ‘Object Toolbar’ to insert the former in the timeline, followed by dragging 2 images into the same. Tap the ‘Play’ button to open the chapter and add suitable text and animation to it in similar way as you would do for a collage. Position the images at the desired place using the red ‘Position Bar’.</p>

You can alternatively press the F9 key from your system’s keyboard to run the slideshow.

To do this, navigate to the ‘Object Toolbar’ at the bottom of the project timeline and select the ‘Collage’ object, followed by dragging the same to the ‘Image List’ to add the latter to your presentation. Once you are done with this, proceed to choose the desired images that you wish to add to the collage, succeeded by dragging the same to the ‘Collage’ object.</p>

Repeat the process till all the images in your collage are at their respective places and within the respective size ratio.</p>
<p>Move ahead with including a relevant text at the end of your collage by selecting the ‘Text’ object in the bottom toolbar. Navigate to the last image of your collage and tap on ‘Text’ object to include it within the last image. You can make suitable formatting adjustments to the added text in the ‘Text’ tab of the ‘Object Settings’.

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Let’s Play!</strong></p>
<p>You can choose to play your slideshow at this stage with simple elements of images and music. All you need to do is, navigate to the ‘Menu Bar’ below the top toolbar and click on Play’ button. You can alternatively press the F9 key from your system’s keyboard to run the slideshow. The app works intelligently to supplement your presentation with random transition effects that play a new animation every time you run the slideshow.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the default arrangements, you can also proceed to make adjustments in the transition play duration and even customize a transition style of your own with text and effects.</p>

<p>To proceed with making adjustments to specific image characteristics, select the desired image and its properties will appear at the right side. You can now work with assigning a particular transition, comments and text to the image, while also making adjustments to the image screen time.</p>
<p>For adhering to the concern of adjusting the play durations of several images in a single instant, select them in the ‘Image List’ through the ‘Ctrl+ A’ command from your system’s keyboard and enter a specific play duration. Your entry will be applied to all the selected images.</p>
<p>You can however, escape the 2-way process by navigating to the ‘Program Settings’ tab and adjusting the pre-set image play duration. Your changes will be applicable to all the slideshow images that have their ‘Use Default Duration’ option enabled.</p>

                ></p>

You can also click on the ‘Play’ icon in the ‘Menu Bar’ and run the slideshow from the current image to see how the applied transition appears over the image.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Text Customizations</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Images’ menu and hit the ‘Text’ tab to include text add-on within the slideshow images while formatting them suitably. You can further, add animations to the text and customize them to stay with or leave the text after the image play duration is over, by tapping the ‘Edit’ button. To present a combined play of text and image, while avoiding the separate text animation, click on the ‘Show Text with Image’ checkbox at the bottom right corner of the ‘Images’ menu.</p>

<p>Navigate to the ‘Sound’ tab and enable your system’s microphone to add recorded comments to your slideshow. Start with clicking on the ‘Record’ button and narrate the comment. Don’t worry about the sync of image and comment play durations as the software program will automatically adjust both to be in line with each other.</p>
<p>If you are interested to add a particular sound file to a specific image, navigate to the ‘Yellow Folder’ at the top right corner to make your selection.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11: Collage Creation</strong></p>
<p>Try hands at including a collage in your slideshow to play several numbers of images and texts within the same time frame. To do this, navigate to the ‘Object Toolbar’ at the bottom of the project timeline and select the ‘Collage’ object, followed by dragging the same to the ‘Image List’ to add the latter to your presentation. Once you are done with this, proceed to choose the desired images that you wish to add to the collage, succeeded by dragging the same to the ‘Collage’ object.</p>

Next, you can proceed with positioning the image at the desired place within the collage. Repeat the process till all the images in your collage are at their respective places and within the respective size ratio.</p>
<p>Move ahead with including a relevant text at the end of your collage by selecting the ‘Text’ object in the bottom toolbar. Navigate to the last image of your collage and tap on ‘Text’ object to include it within the last image. You can make suitable formatting adjustments to the added text in the ‘Text’ tab of the ‘Object Settings’. Position your text at the appropriate place within the image and check a preview of the same by clicking on the ‘Play’ button in the ‘Menu Bar’ above the project timeline.</p>

Start with selecting the ‘Chapter’ object from the ‘Object Toolbar’ to insert the former in the timeline, followed by dragging 2 images into the same. Tap the ‘Play’ button to open the chapter and add suitable text and animation to it in similar way as you would do for a collage.

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Let’s Play!</strong></p>
<p>You can choose to play your slideshow at this stage with simple elements of images and music. All you need to do is, navigate to the ‘Menu Bar’ below the top toolbar and click on Play’ button. You can alternatively press the F9 key from your system’s keyboard to run the slideshow. The app works intelligently to supplement your presentation with random transition effects that play a new animation every time you run the slideshow.</p>

<p>To proceed with making adjustments to specific image characteristics, select the desired image and its properties will appear at the right side. You can now work with assigning a particular transition, comments and text to the image, while also making adjustments to the image screen time.</p>
<p>For adhering to the concern of adjusting the play durations of several images in a single instant, select them in the ‘Image List’ through the ‘Ctrl+ A’ command from your system’s keyboard and enter a specific play duration. Your entry will be applied to all the selected images.</p>
<p>You can however, escape the 2-way process by navigating to the ‘Program Settings’ tab and adjusting the pre-set image play duration. Your changes will be applicable to all the slideshow images that have their ‘Use Default Duration’ option enabled.</p>

                ></p>

You can also click on the ‘Play’ icon in the ‘Menu Bar’ and run the slideshow from the current image to see how the applied transition appears over the image.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Text Customizations</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Images’ menu and hit the ‘Text’ tab to include text add-on within the slideshow images while formatting them suitably. You can further, add animations to the text and customize them to stay with or leave the text after the image play duration is over, by tapping the ‘Edit’ button.

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11: Collage Creation</strong></p>
<p>Try hands at including a collage in your slideshow to play several numbers of images and texts within the same time frame. To do this, navigate to the ‘Object Toolbar’ at the bottom of the project timeline and select the ‘Collage’ object, followed by dragging the same to the ‘Image List’ to add the latter to your presentation. Once you are done with this, proceed to choose the desired images that you wish to add to the collage, succeeded by dragging the same to the ‘Collage’ object.</p>
<p>Move ahead with expanding the collage, to ensure a proper display of the images. You can further, apply selected transitions to the created collage under the latter’s ‘Object Settings’.</p>

<p>Start with selecting the first image of your collage and adjusting its size in the ‘Layout Designer’ through the position frame at the edges of the photo. Next, you can proceed with positioning the image at the desired place within the collage. Repeat the process till all the images in your collage are at their respective places and within the respective size ratio.</p>
<p>Move ahead with including a relevant text at the end of your collage by selecting the ‘Text’ object in the bottom toolbar. Navigate to the last image of your collage and tap on ‘Text’ object to include it within the last image. You can make suitable formatting adjustments to the added text in the ‘Text’ tab of the ‘Object Settings’. Position your text at the appropriate place within the image and check a preview of the same by clicking on the ‘Play’ button in the ‘Menu Bar’ above the project timeline.</p>

Start with selecting the ‘Chapter’ object from the ‘Object Toolbar’ to insert the former in the timeline, followed by dragging 2 images into the same. Tap the ‘Play’ button to open the chapter and add suitable text and animation to it in similar way as you would do for a collage.

They work on the concept of bringing a simulated environment to the user. Both VR i.e. the virtual reality and AR i.e. augmented reality are technologies used to replace or enhance the real-life environment with the simulated one. Virtual reality is the replacement of real-life environments with simulated ones. Whereas, Augmented reality is the procedure of augmenting the real-life environment with the addition of digital elements to a live view. This can be done by the camera on a smartphone.</p>
<p>The main aim of designing AR is to provide detailed information to the user about the real world. Its whole design is done by considering and adding the elements of the real world. Whereas, virtual reality is an entirely different simulation. It completely replaces the real-world environment with the virtual world.</p>
<p>Even Though both technologies are the simulation of the real world, they use different components of design and also have distinct targeted audiences. The concept behind VR is to distance the user from the real world as much as possible. Whereas, the concept of AR works with the real world to create a simulated environment.</p>
<p>The use of an eye-covering headset and headphones is very common to make an illusion of the real world, in the case of VR. Whereas, AR is usually accomplished with a smartphone or tablet screen. Here, the camera of the phone is focused at a point to capture the live-streaming of a moment on the screen. The captured data is then prepared by adding some useful information.</p>
<p>The applications of VR are architecture and retail, training, product design, etc. Whereas, the applications of AR are diagnostic data, navigation information, repair instructions, etc. The availability of <strong>ar video maker</strong> also eases the task of the industries for the mentioned purposes.</p>

They work on the concept of bringing a simulated environment to the user. Both VR i.e. the virtual reality and AR i.e. augmented reality are technologies used to replace or enhance the real-life environment with the simulated one. Virtual reality is the replacement of real-life environments with simulated ones. Whereas, Augmented reality is the procedure of augmenting the real-life environment with the addition of digital elements to a live view. This can be done by the camera on a smartphone.</p>
<p>The main aim of designing AR is to provide detailed information to the user about the real world. Its whole design is done by considering and adding the elements of the real world. Whereas, virtual reality is an entirely different simulation. It completely replaces the real-world environment with the virtual world.</p>
<p>Even Though both technologies are the simulation of the real world, they use different components of design and also have distinct targeted audiences. The concept behind VR is to distance the user from the real world as much as possible. Whereas, the concept of AR works with the real world to create a simulated environment.</p>
<p>The use of an eye-covering headset and headphones is very common to make an illusion of the real world, in the case of VR. Whereas, AR is usually accomplished with a smartphone or tablet screen. Here, the camera of the phone is focused at a point to capture the live-streaming of a moment on the screen. The captured data is then prepared by adding some useful information.</p>
<p>The applications of VR are architecture and retail, training, product design, etc. Whereas, the applications of AR are diagnostic data, navigation information, repair instructions, etc. The availability of <strong>ar video maker</strong> also eases the task of the industries for the mentioned purposes.</p>

They work on the concept of bringing a simulated environment to the user. Both VR i.e. the virtual reality and AR i.e. augmented reality are technologies used to replace or enhance the real-life environment with the simulated one. Virtual reality is the replacement of real-life environments with simulated ones. Whereas, Augmented reality is the procedure of augmenting the real-life environment with the addition of digital elements to a live view. This can be done by the camera on a smartphone.</p>
<p>The main aim of designing AR is to provide detailed information to the user about the real world. Its whole design is done by considering and adding the elements of the real world. Whereas, virtual reality is an entirely different simulation. It completely replaces the real-world environment with the virtual world.</p>
<p>Even Though both technologies are the simulation of the real world, they use different components of design and also have distinct targeted audiences. The concept behind VR is to distance the user from the real world as much as possible. Whereas, the concept of AR works with the real world to create a simulated environment.</p>
<p>The use of an eye-covering headset and headphones is very common to make an illusion of the real world, in the case of VR. Whereas, AR is usually accomplished with a smartphone or tablet screen. Here, the camera of the phone is focused at a point to capture the live-streaming of a moment on the screen. The captured data is then prepared by adding some useful information.</p>
<p>The applications of VR are architecture and retail, training, product design, etc. Whereas, the applications of AR are diagnostic data, navigation information, repair instructions, etc. The availability of <strong>ar video maker</strong> also eases the task of the industries for the mentioned purposes.</p>

This company first came into being in 1950 by the name of “Photographic Analysis Company .”During the initial years, the company produced many cameras that could tackle the need for high-speed photography. However, in 1992, the company decided to create a separate entity to create high-speed cameras that wouldn’t depend on photographic film for imaging.</p>
<p>The US Patent Office acknowledged the use of innovative technology in the Phantom high-speed cameras. The main aim of this company is to produce robust cameras that can capture faster frame rates in high-speed photography. Many industries like defense, academia, and science research use <strong>Phantom slow-motion cameras</strong>. They are used in microfluidics, transparent flows, imaging, etc.</p>

Post that, all you need to do is, activate the service and adhere to the following user guide to start converting texts into audio with the program:</p>
<h3 id="02User’s-Guide-for-Converting-Text-to-Speech-in-Panopreter-3"><a href="#02User’s-Guide-for-Converting-Text-to-Speech-in-Panopreter-3" class="headerlink" title="02User’s Guide for Converting Text to Speech in Panopreter"></a>02User’s Guide for Converting Text to Speech in Panopreter</h3><p><strong>Step 1: Download the Converter Program</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the official Panopreter website and download the software to your system. Once then download gets completed, proceed to install the same and wait for the program’s welcome screen to appear.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Mode Selection and Setting</strong></p>
<p>As the launch screen pops up, you will be asked to choose the preferred working mode from the ‘Input and Speak’ and ‘Read Batch Files’ alternatives. You should know that the former is the default operation mode of the software and you can activate the same in a few steps.</p>
<p>Start with navigating to the ‘Menu Options’ tab and clicking on the ‘Settings’ option in the latter’s drop down list. The ‘Settings’ dialog box pops up, where you need to hit the ‘Speak Node’ option in the panel at the left. In the ‘Speak Window’ that appears next, click within the checkbox of your desired option and that’s it! The default ‘Input and Speak’ mode will be activated when you re-launch the software.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you desire to work in the ‘Read Batch Files’ mode, navigate to the ‘Menu Bar’ at the top of the software interface and hit the ‘File’ tab. From the list of items that drops down, select the ‘Read Batch Files’ option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Mode Specific Software Operation</strong></p>
<p>If you are working in the ‘Input and Speak’ mode, you can proceed with typing or pasting a desired text within the ‘Text Window’ Another option is to open a desired text document or file directly from your system. As for working in the ‘Read Batch Files’ mode, you are allowed to manage your system’s text files through the ‘Open’, ‘Clear’ and ‘Delete’ buttons. You should however take caution to add all the files in a common language.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Language Selection</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Language List’ window and pick a preferred language to convert the text files into audio transcripts. Remember to choose the same conversion language as added of the ‘Text Window’ files in Step 2, lest you would end up getting an undesirable speech output.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Voice Selection</strong></p>
<p>As you complete Step 4, a series of preset text to speech voice alternatives present within your system for the preferred language will show up in the ‘Voice Window’. Proceed to select the voice type you like.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Read Aloud!</strong></p>
<p>After you have selected the voice, tap the ‘Speak’ button and start reading your text aloud. Amid the process, you will see the ‘Stop’, ‘Resume’ and ‘Pause’ buttons getting enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Save Your Transcription</strong></p>
<p>When you have finished reading the text, click on the ‘Stop’ button to end the transcription process. The ‘Save as Audio’ option gets enabled, allowing you to convert your text into speech in the MP3, OGG, WAV and FLAC file formats.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Customize Your Audio</strong></p>
<p>The Panopreter program lets you add suitable customizations to the transcribed audio to ensure affordable file size and sound quality. You can adjust the bit rate and sample rate to address the aforesaid concern. All you need to do is, head to the ‘Menu Options’ at the top of the app screen and select ‘Settings’.</p>

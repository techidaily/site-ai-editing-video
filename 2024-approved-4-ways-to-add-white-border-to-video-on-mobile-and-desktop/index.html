Consumers are now savvy as they now take a step further, like using ad blockers or tuning out ads.</p>
<p>However, it doesn’t imply the end of advertising as a brand promotion tool altogether. Individuals still desire best-in-class deals and products and spend their money shopping. All they need is to get informed about the product or service more entertainingly and innovatively.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why many established brands are now shifting toward their <strong>brand storytelling</strong>. And there’s no better and highly effective way to portray <strong>your brand story</strong> than with video. Simply making a video resembling any conventional TV commercial ad with an irritating ‘Call Today’ voiceover won’t be enough to get results.</p>
<p>Modern-day consumers are much more educated and sophisticated than before. You must learn how many creative and successful brands are infusing their <strong>branding and storytelling</strong> strategies to engage their customers. If you’re reading this article, you’re aiming to build your own <strong>brand storytelling video</strong> and are wondering how to make it a successful one.</p>

Spotify - All Ears On You</h3><p>Since 2008, Spotify has continued gathering as much information (personal preferences, likes, and dislikes) about their audiences as possible. It has helped them set personalized ad campaigns that will best fit their customers’ interests.</p>
<p>One of their latest, popular campaigns is ‘All Ears On You.’ Take a glimpse of this <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCXJrqUdrk" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to check how the video ad appears. Launched in June, this campaign focuses on celebrating your weird listening habits. It leveraged the users’ in-app experience to let them be proud of their unique choices. This helped Spotify to strengthen its emotional relationship with its listeners.</p>
<p><strong>Learn From Spotify’s Famous Marketing Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get the Most Out of Big Data:</strong> The customer insights and data helped Spotify make precise, on-point ads. Your firm should also acquire customers’ data and later leverage it to amplify the user experience and make marketing campaigns more relatable.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage User-Generated Content:</strong> Your audience is more interested in what other customers think and say about your business. The most successful video ads don’t involve facts about the company but the customers instead. Make a video using clips where your customers tell a story about themselves and their experience with your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Utilize The Trending Hashtags &amp;</strong> <strong>Topics</strong>: Social medial trends and news feed is what attracts today’s customers the most. Spotify’s advertisement team always wraps their ad campaigns into a package of top-events-and-stories. Find the most popular and trending hashtags and topics related to your business niche and incorporate them in your brand storytelling video.</li>
</ul>

<p>Their official tagline also turned out to be ‘Belong Anywhere,’ which eventually led to the development of their whole brand story and new logo. This symbol was created to make sure it’s instantly recognizable.</p>
<p><strong>Valuable Storytelling Lessons From Airbnb’s Marketing Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Let Your Customers Be At The Heart Of Your Organization</strong>: After interviewing users, Airbnb found out that no one can better inform them about their company than the community of their regular users. The conversations and interviews with such users helped Airbnb to prepare its entire brand story. Thus, you should, too, keep your customers at your core.</li>
<li><strong>It’s Never Too Late To Discover Your Story</strong>: Although launched in 2008, the company Airbnb realized they’d need to discover their business mission to scale and progress. They are an example that it’s never too late for your brand to find the brand story.</li>
<li><strong>Content Is The King:</strong> Airbnb always keeps posting content on its own blog and YouTube channel. Most of their content is based on user experiences and revolves around stories from within the brand’s community. Such high-quality content helped them to engage with the customers more efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-Apple-Chase"><a href="#3-Apple-Chase" class="headerlink" title="3. Apple - Chase"></a>3. Apple - Chase</h3><p>Chase recently announced via email their latest introduction to the market - Apple Pay. They introduced it in collaboration with Apple as the new mode to pay. Chase leveraged this email communication to inform people about their latest collaboration with Apple.</p>
<p>They also used email to reinforce their commitment to helping people to buy Apple products like the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=175GAmhgzSk" >iPhone 14 pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with accessible funds. While ensuring to align with Apple’s marketing strategy for the Apple Pay service announcement (primarily based on social media), Chase put more emphasis on real-time media.</p>
<p>Their marketing practice used direct, real-time media to connect with the on-the-go audience seemingly ready to buy an Apple product with a quick source of funds. Their brand story ad focused more on the ‘on-the-go’ audience who would readily agree to make such a purchase.</p>
<h3 id="4-Nike-Most-Powerful-Brand-Story-Videos"><a href="#4-Nike-Most-Powerful-Brand-Story-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Nike - Most Powerful Brand Story Videos"></a>4. Nike - Most Powerful Brand Story Videos</h3><p>If you’ve watched a Nike video ad featuring <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dIAMe1sQno" >LeBron James <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or others, you’ll know how much emphasis on emotions and inspiration. They don’t go for the direct marketing of their brand and products. Instead, they produce video ads with a powerful message drawn from a compelling storyline.</p>
<p>This makes Nike unique from numerous other brands as it has been an expert in brand storytelling for years now. Every piece of video ad from their collection triggers the audience’s feelings and emotions, which can only be met and satisfied by using Nike products.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of power within emotional branding, and Nike has shaped and transformed its whole marketing model into a storytelling form that motivates the audience to take action - ‘Just do it with Nike products. Some of the marketing strategies that have helped them grow over the years include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>They promote the advantages of their product’s features rather than simply highlighting and promoting the features. This is called <strong>benefit-based marketing practice</strong>.</li>
<li>They <strong>sell brand stories more than their products</strong>, which has always been their primary marketing strategy.</li>
<li>Nike is very strong in the <strong>social media game</strong>. They leverage user-generated content to create their video ads.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborating with influencers</strong> like LeBron James and Cristiano Ronaldo has always been at the core of their marketing strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-Bells-Reader"><a href="#5-Bells-Reader" class="headerlink" title="5. Bells - Reader"></a>5. Bells - Reader</h3><p>The marketing manager of Bell - Thami Silwana - revealed that the idea behind the ‘Bells-Reader’ campaign is to assist men in acknowledging, comprehending, and speaking about their personal victories.</p>
<p>They realized that sometimes it could be troublesome for men to interact with one another and acknowledge their inside feeling and emotions when one of them have achieved something. Their tagline, ‘Give That Man a Bell, ’ best fits in terms of a man-to-man acknowledging something worth the celebration.</p>
<p>Here is what the video ad director Greg incorporated in the video to make it hit the marketing campaign’s motto:</p>
<p><strong>Sentimentality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greg incorporated an excellent blend of drama, emotion, and sentimentality in this two minutes video ad, which was as good as a two-hour Hollywood movie.</li>
<li>The video hit the emotions on so many levels that you’ll feel like drinking a glass of whisky at the end of the ad.</li>
<li>Your brand should also create a brand story video where you help your customers to acknowledge themselves by hitting their emotions at different levels.</li>
<li>To know how just take a look at the ad yourself: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy7fxLwfOnQ&list=PL7tol-2iOCrEp2GQB0K1LxjIStnbFPi1f" >https://www.youtube.com/watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>

<p>Part I. The Most Successful Video Practises of Brand Storytelling</p>
<h3 id="1-Spotify-All-Ears-On-You-1"><a href="#1-Spotify-All-Ears-On-You-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Spotify - All Ears On You"></a>1. Spotify - All Ears On You</h3><p>Since 2008, Spotify has continued gathering as much information (personal preferences, likes, and dislikes) about their audiences as possible. It has helped them set personalized ad campaigns that will best fit their customers’ interests.</p>
<p>One of their latest, popular campaigns is ‘All Ears On You.’ Take a glimpse of this <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCXJrqUdrk" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to check how the video ad appears. Launched in June, this campaign focuses on celebrating your weird listening habits. It leveraged the users’ in-app experience to let them be proud of their unique choices. This helped Spotify to strengthen its emotional relationship with its listeners.</p>
<p><strong>Learn From Spotify’s Famous Marketing Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get the Most Out of Big Data:</strong> The customer insights and data helped Spotify make precise, on-point ads. Your firm should also acquire customers’ data and later leverage it to amplify the user experience and make marketing campaigns more relatable.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage User-Generated Content:</strong> Your audience is more interested in what other customers think and say about your business. The most successful video ads don’t involve facts about the company but the customers instead. Make a video using clips where your customers tell a story about themselves and their experience with your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Utilize The Trending Hashtags &amp;</strong> <strong>Topics</strong>: Social medial trends and news feed is what attracts today’s customers the most. Spotify’s advertisement team always wraps their ad campaigns into a package of top-events-and-stories. Find the most popular and trending hashtags and topics related to your business niche and incorporate them in your brand storytelling video.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other marketing practices that teach valuable lessons to businesses for brand video marketing include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leveraging the mentions on social media platforms</li>
<li>Going for a customer-centric marketing approach with personalized interactions</li>

Airbnb - The Story of a Symbol of Belonging</h3><p>The center of focus of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMITXMrrVQU" >Airbnb’s brand story <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> revolves around the basic ideology of ‘belonging.’ The brand found its mission - to shape the world into a place where individuals can ‘belong anywhere.’</p>
<p>Their official tagline also turned out to be ‘Belong Anywhere,’ which eventually led to the development of their whole brand story and new logo. This symbol was created to make sure it’s instantly recognizable.</p>
<p><strong>Valuable Storytelling Lessons From Airbnb’s Marketing Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Let Your Customers Be At The Heart Of Your Organization</strong>: After interviewing users, Airbnb found out that no one can better inform them about their company than the community of their regular users. The conversations and interviews with such users helped Airbnb to prepare its entire brand story. Thus, you should, too, keep your customers at your core.</li>
<li><strong>It’s Never Too Late To Discover Your Story</strong>: Although launched in 2008, the company Airbnb realized they’d need to discover their business mission to scale and progress. They are an example that it’s never too late for your brand to find the brand story.</li>
<li><strong>Content Is The King:</strong> Airbnb always keeps posting content on its own blog and YouTube channel. Most of their content is based on user experiences and revolves around stories from within the brand’s community. Such high-quality content helped them to engage with the customers more efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-Apple-Chase-1"><a href="#3-Apple-Chase-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Apple - Chase"></a>3. Apple - Chase</h3><p>Chase recently announced via email their latest introduction to the market - Apple Pay. They introduced it in collaboration with Apple as the new mode to pay. Chase leveraged this email communication to inform people about their latest collaboration with Apple.</p>
<p>They also used email to reinforce their commitment to helping people to buy Apple products like the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=175GAmhgzSk" >iPhone 14 pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with accessible funds. While ensuring to align with Apple’s marketing strategy for the Apple Pay service announcement (primarily based on social media), Chase put more emphasis on real-time media.</p>
<p>Their marketing practice used direct, real-time media to connect with the on-the-go audience seemingly ready to buy an Apple product with a quick source of funds. Their brand story ad focused more on the ‘on-the-go’ audience who would readily agree to make such a purchase.</p>
<h3 id="4-Nike-Most-Powerful-Brand-Story-Videos-1"><a href="#4-Nike-Most-Powerful-Brand-Story-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Nike - Most Powerful Brand Story Videos"></a>4. Nike - Most Powerful Brand Story Videos</h3><p>If you’ve watched a Nike video ad featuring <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dIAMe1sQno" >LeBron James <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or others, you’ll know how much emphasis on emotions and inspiration. They don’t go for the direct marketing of their brand and products. Instead, they produce video ads with a powerful message drawn from a compelling storyline.</p>
<p>This makes Nike unique from numerous other brands as it has been an expert in brand storytelling for years now. Every piece of video ad from their collection triggers the audience’s feelings and emotions, which can only be met and satisfied by using Nike products.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of power within emotional branding, and Nike has shaped and transformed its whole marketing model into a storytelling form that motivates the audience to take action - ‘Just do it with Nike products. Some of the marketing strategies that have helped them grow over the years include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>They promote the advantages of their product’s features rather than simply highlighting and promoting the features. This is called <strong>benefit-based marketing practice</strong>.</li>
<li>They <strong>sell brand stories more than their products</strong>, which has always been their primary marketing strategy.</li>
<li>Nike is very strong in the <strong>social media game</strong>. They leverage user-generated content to create their video ads.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborating with influencers</strong> like LeBron James and Cristiano Ronaldo has always been at the core of their marketing strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-Bells-Reader-1"><a href="#5-Bells-Reader-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Bells - Reader"></a>5. Bells - Reader</h3><p>The marketing manager of Bell - Thami Silwana - revealed that the idea behind the ‘Bells-Reader’ campaign is to assist men in acknowledging, comprehending, and speaking about their personal victories.</p>
<p>They realized that sometimes it could be troublesome for men to interact with one another and acknowledge their inside feeling and emotions when one of them have achieved something. Their tagline, ‘Give That Man a Bell, ’ best fits in terms of a man-to-man acknowledging something worth the celebration.</p>
<p>Here is what the video ad director Greg incorporated in the video to make it hit the marketing campaign’s motto:</p>
<p><strong>Sentimentality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greg incorporated an excellent blend of drama, emotion, and sentimentality in this two minutes video ad, which was as good as a two-hour Hollywood movie.</li>
<li>The video hit the emotions on so many levels that you’ll feel like drinking a glass of whisky at the end of the ad.</li>
<li>Your brand should also create a brand story video where you help your customers to acknowledge themselves by hitting their emotions at different levels.</li>
<li>To know how just take a look at the ad yourself: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy7fxLwfOnQ&list=PL7tol-2iOCrEp2GQB0K1LxjIStnbFPi1f" >https://www.youtube.com/watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>

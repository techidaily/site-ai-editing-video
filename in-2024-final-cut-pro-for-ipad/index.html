            <h2 id="Final-Cut-Pro-for-iPad"><a href="#Final-Cut-Pro-for-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Final Cut Pro for iPad"></a>Final Cut Pro for iPad</h2><p>Final Cut Pro by Apple is the most popular premium video editor among macOS users. Starting from social media videos to short films and movies, Final Cut Pro is a popular choice. Even though video editing using FCP is mostly done on Mac, there are many who prefer video editing on their powerful phones. It is quite shocking that Final Cut Pro for Android and iOS users is not yet available.</p>
<p>Since it is an Apple-exclusive application, you would have expected FCP mobile app for iPhone and iPad. But Apple is yet to develop a mobile app for Final Cut Pro. Naturally, we have to look for Final Cut Pro alternative mobile apps for smartphone users. The alternatives need to be as feature-rich and powerful as FCP. Here is the list of the best Final Cut Pro alternative apps for Android and iOS users.</p>

You can use it to specify the number of pictures and then insert pictures from a file. There is also the option of using Word Tables which can be used in any version of Microsoft Word to create a certain arrangement for your photo collage. Word Tables give the user complete control over the layout of the collage and this makes it easier for the user to arrange the pictures of the collage.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Use-LUTs-in-Lumafusion-Free-Resource"><a href="#How-to-Use-LUTs-in-Lumafusion-Free-Resource" class="headerlink" title="How to Use LUTs in Lumafusion &amp; Free Resource"></a>How to Use LUTs in Lumafusion &amp; Free Resource</h2><p>LumaFusion is one of the most complex iPad and iPhone video editing apps. Many of its customers adore it, and it has some incredible capabilities that you’d find incompetent editing software. They’ve effectively opened up the realm of LUTs to iPhone and iPad users.</p>
<p>LumaFusion LUTs are individual files that act as containers in LumaFusion. This container file includes standard LUT data as well as LumaFusion-specific color preset data. A LumaFusion LUT Preset file is similar to a Super LUT. LumaFusion can only employ one standard LUT at a time; however, LumaFusion LUT presets enable simultaneous Color Grading and Color Corrections.</p>
<h2 id="How-will-LUTs-help-with-color-correction-in-Lumafusion"><a href="#How-will-LUTs-help-with-color-correction-in-Lumafusion" class="headerlink" title="How will LUTs help with color correction in Lumafusion"></a>How will LUTs help with color correction in Lumafusion</h2><p>Colors in today’s cameras are vibrant, but they may continuously be improved. Color correction corrects the color that’s already there, whether it’s boosting the exposure to brighten a darker photo or increasing the saturation to make the colors pop. Color correction in other NLEs can be difficult, but not in LumaFusion.</p>
<p>The Color Presets tab in the Color &amp; Effects section is where you begin color correcting footage. There are various presets from which to pick. I wouldn’t use these settings on my videos because they’re too stylized, but they’re there. You may alter any of the presets to your taste, so some of the more dramatic ones can be toned down. By picking the original setting, purists can color-fix their raw footage without using LumaFusion. Moving the sliders till the color seems perfect is all that’s required from there.</p>
<p>Exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, mid-tones, and saturation and hue are all controlled by sliders. The color sliders can be used for a more forceful approach. But proceed with caution. The sliders are delicate, and it’s easy to overdo them. Play around with the sliders until you get the look you want. If you don’t like it, toss it in the trashcan and start over.</p>
<p>Color grading and color correction are not interchangeable terms. Color correction is a technical requirement, but color grading is primarily creative. You’ll have no command over the color grading process if you’re working with film material where primary colors aren’t even visible. Before diving into the creative LUTs, make sure you complete adequate color correcting.</p>
<p>Color grading, unlike color correction, adjusts the shot’s color to modify the atmosphere or feel. The only way to do that in LumaFusion is to play around with the color sliders under the Color Presets tab, but that’s not ideal. As previously stated, the three sliders are sensitive and limited. LumaFusion isn’t designed for color grading, which is OK. Thankfully, LumaFusion allows you to use LUTs.</p>
<p>Always color correct your footage before utilizing any LUTS, which entails changing the White-balance, Highlights, Contrast, and Shadows. Do not apply the LUTS to your footage directly.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-use-LUTs-in-Lumafusion"><a href="#How-to-use-LUTs-in-Lumafusion" class="headerlink" title="How to use LUTs in Lumafusion?"></a>How to use LUTs in Lumafusion?</h2><p>Videographers, colorists, and editors use LUTs because they are efficient. Rather than starting from zero every time you work on a video editing project, you may speed up the color grading process using a LUT with predefined color profiles. It’s elementary to import LUTs. Simply import the preset files into LumaFusion and add the preset to your footage like an Instagram filter.</p>
<p>The Import button in the Color &amp; Effects editor is the easiest way to load LUTs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Double click on any video&#x2F;photo clip on the timeline to access the Clip Editors.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the Clip Editor UI, select the Color &amp; Effects tab.</li>
<li>The import button is located directly below the effect preset library.</li>

Consumers are now savvy as they now take a step further, like using ad blockers or tuning out ads.</p>
<p>However, it doesn’t imply the end of advertising as a brand promotion tool altogether. Individuals still desire best-in-class deals and products and spend their money shopping. All they need is to get informed about the product or service more entertainingly and innovatively.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why many established brands are now shifting toward their <strong>brand storytelling</strong>. And there’s no better and highly effective way to portray <strong>your brand story</strong> than with video. Simply making a video resembling any conventional TV commercial ad with an irritating ‘Call Today’ voiceover won’t be enough to get results.</p>

You must learn how many creative and successful brands are infusing their <strong>branding and storytelling</strong> strategies to engage their customers. If you’re reading this article, you’re aiming to build your own <strong>brand storytelling video</strong> and are wondering how to make it a successful one.</p>

Bells - Reader</h3><p>The marketing manager of Bell - Thami Silwana - revealed that the idea behind the ‘Bells-Reader’ campaign is to assist men in acknowledging, comprehending, and speaking about their personal victories.</p>
<p>They realized that sometimes it could be troublesome for men to interact with one another and acknowledge their inside feeling and emotions when one of them have achieved something. Their tagline, ‘Give That Man a Bell, ’ best fits in terms of a man-to-man acknowledging something worth the celebration.</p>
<p>Here is what the video ad director Greg incorporated in the video to make it hit the marketing campaign’s motto:</p>
<p><strong>Sentimentality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greg incorporated an excellent blend of drama, emotion, and sentimentality in this two minutes video ad, which was as good as a two-hour Hollywood movie.</li>
<li>The video hit the emotions on so many levels that you’ll feel like drinking a glass of whisky at the end of the ad.</li>
<li>Your brand should also create a brand story video where you help your customers to acknowledge themselves by hitting their emotions at different levels.</li>
<li>To know how just take a look at the ad yourself: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy7fxLwfOnQ&list=PL7tol-2iOCrEp2GQB0K1LxjIStnbFPi1f" >https://www.youtube.com/watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>

<h3 id="6-Dove-You’re-More-Beautiful-Than-You-Think-1"><a href="#6-Dove-You’re-More-Beautiful-Than-You-Think-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Dove - You’re More Beautiful Than You Think"></a>6. Dove - You’re More Beautiful Than You Think</h3><p>The Real Beauty Ad Campaign by Dove focuses on women’s natural charisma and beauty. The ad emphasizes promoting the self-esteem of every woman. In their ‘<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=litXW91UauE" >Dove Real Beauty Sketches’ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> video ad, you’ll find the events to be chosen, arranged, connected, and assessed as meaningful for a specific set of audience.</p>
<p>Although the video ad’s primary focus is women’s empowerment, it’s still a commercial that promotes Dove products. The ad ends with the phrase ‘you’re more beautiful than you think,’ and a Dove brand logo appears.</p>
<p>Significantly, Dove desires women to know that they are always encouraged, supported, and acknowledged for their real beauty. This storytelling helped Dove boost its product sales without making any direct references.</p>

El Gordo - The Spanish Christmas Lottery Ad 2021"></a>7. El Gordo - The Spanish Christmas Lottery Ad 2021</h3><p>Conventionally, you’ll get to know about the arrival of Christmas in Spain when you’ll find the Spanish Christmas Lottery hitting the screens as a commercial. The <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcWQ3PdDLj4" >Christmas Lottery’s 2021 ad version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was recorded and created in the picturesque and snowy town of Elizondo.</p>
<p>The ad signifies the spirit of the Christmas festive season and amazingly resonates with the motto of El Gordo - the greatest prize is to share it. They used aesthetics and scenic beauty to allure the viewers and drive them into buying the lottery.</p>
<p>They used the marketing practice of hitting people’s emotions during Christmas when they could truly immerse themselves into enjoying things like winning the lottery.</p>

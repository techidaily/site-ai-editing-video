Learn More Here</h2><p>Although After Effects (AE) is a fantastic tool for creating UI animation prototypes, we’re constantly searching for methods to make our process go more quickly. Expressions are supported by AE and allow the designer to animate layers without manually specifying each keyframe by establishing connections between layer parameters or keyframes. We’ll go through the fundamentals of using and defining expressions as well as how to adapt them to your own need.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-After-Effects-Expression"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-After-Effects-Expression" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is After Effects Expression"></a>Part 1. What is After Effects Expression</h2><p>Expressions are sections of code created in the JavaScript programming languages with the sole objective of changing the layer attributes in After Effects. They can create adaptable rigs and automate repetitive processes. Because of this, developing and modifying the code should be a breeze. There are many phrases that already exist and have for many years, but finding them might be challenging if you aren’t sure what you’re searching for. They may be as small as a single word or integer, or very complicated, including chapters and paragraphs of code.</p>
<p>You may begin forming connections between a property and other layers when you write an expression on that property. By connecting the expressions to the numerical parameters, the expression controllers in the Effects &amp; Presets panel may assist you in better controlling the expressions. Although they are by no means necessary, expressions come in quite handy when attempting to replicate effects like inertia or bouncing without having to specify a ton of extra keyframes. They not only provide many creative possibilities, but they may also streamline your motion design process.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Common-Expressions-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-2-Common-Expressions-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Common Expressions in After Effects"></a>Part 2. Common Expressions in After Effects</h2><p>An expression is a brief piece of JavaScript code that can be plugged into animated properties in After Effects applications. Expressions evaluate to a single value for a single layer property at a particular instant in time. Below are a few popular expressions.</p>
<h3 id="1-‘thisComp’"><a href="#1-‘thisComp’" class="headerlink" title="1. ‘thisComp’"></a>1. ‘thisComp’</h3><p>Expressions in After Effects revolve entirely on manipulating values inside an object hierarchy. Objects in this context include the composition, specific layers, and even effects. Values or other things may be contained by an object.</p>
<p>Use thisComp together with some fundamental arithmetic to precisely place things on the screen. This comes in quite helpful when exporting several versions for social media sites and reusing content. To have the logo scale in accordance with the size of the comp, you could even add a similar statement to the Scale option.</p>
<h3 id="2-‘loopOut’"><a href="#2-‘loopOut’" class="headerlink" title="2. ‘loopOut’"></a>2. ‘loopOut’</h3><p>You can always simply copy and paste keyframes throughout the timeline if you want an animation to repeat. But if you wanted to make adjustments, you’d have to go back and deal with all of those keyframes again. Again, you’d never see Batman using After Effects accomplishing this. You should use the loopOut expression in these circumstances. Even four options may be used to modify how the animation loops.</p>
<p>Again, cycle is the default setting; however, you may also choose from continue, offset, and ping pong. It just requires animating an Ellipse’s Scale and Opacity properties, then adding loopOut to each of them. The two keyframes are immediately cycled; it is plug and play. There are really just four keyframes in total, however the animation lasts the full length of the timeline. Use two keyframes per parameter to keep things simple, or specify which keyframes you want to loop to make things more complicated.</p>
<h3 id="3-‘random’"><a href="#3-‘random’" class="headerlink" title="3. ‘random’"></a>3. ‘random’</h3><p>As implied by the name, each frame’s value is generated randomly by this expression based on the argument you provide. It will automatically randomize between 0 and 1 if you leave it empty. The parameter will generate a value at random between 0 and the value you provide between the parentheses. It will generate random numbers between the two values you enter.</p>
<p>Another excellent expression for rapidly producing an animation is this one. We often use it to make opacity transitions that flicker. It just takes a few clicks to do this by adding the phrase below to Opacity and keyframing it in and out from 100% Opacity.</p>
<h3 id="4-‘Wiggle’"><a href="#4-‘Wiggle’" class="headerlink" title="4. ‘Wiggle’"></a>4. ‘Wiggle’</h3><p>One of the few expressions that may be used without keyframes is the Wiggle expression. Watch your shape begin to wiggle by simply adding the phrase to any Transform attribute. It will jiggle between keyframes if you decide to add them.</p>
<p>You will simultaneously move in two dimensions while using this phrase. You may sometimes just need to jiggle one dimension. The After Effects Wiggle expression (also known as AE Wiggle) is an excellent tool for creating erratic item movement, idle character movement, unpredictable camera motion, shaky lettering, and flashing lights.</p>
<h3 id="5-‘Time’"><a href="#5-‘Time’" class="headerlink" title="5. ‘Time’"></a>5. ‘Time’</h3><p>The greater the value next to “time” below, the quicker your animation will be. Time expression is useful for continuous animation. Utilizing time is one of the fastest and simplest methods to create an animation. Time just creates each second’s numerical value in the timeline. Remember that regardless of the timecode settings, this number begins at zero at the beginning of the comp.</p>
<p>Again, combine this with some simple arithmetic for excellent outcomes. To find a multiplier value that works for the parameter you are animating, play around and explore. Use it to gradually modify a layer’s position or rotation. Time is also very useful for driving animated textures like the Fractal or Turbulent Noise effects. The evolution parameter is increased by a factor of 100 throughout time.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Add-Expressions-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Add-Expressions-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Add Expressions in After Effects"></a>Part 3. How to Add Expressions in After Effects</h2><p>In Adobe AE, expressions may be added to any kind of layer and any form of layer attribute. Don’t give up; one of the best things about expressions is that you don’t have to be an expert programmer or coder to use them. A variety of transform effects may have expressions applied to them to generate fascinating animation, which might take hours to create from scratch.</p>
<p>While some idioms are brief, simple, and easy to use and comprehend, others are wordy and complex. Even though they can appear difficult, sticking them in their designated spot should work. The process of adding expressions is always the same; the code varies based on your goals. Learning how to apply an Expression effect to your layer is the first step.</p>
<p>Step1 Include your form or image in the timeline. When viewing the layer’s properties, click on the stopwatch of the property you wish to apply the phrase to while holding “Alt” (PC) or “Option” (Mac).</p>

## Part 1\. What is After Effects Expression

<p>Expressions are sections of code created in the JavaScript programming languages with the sole objective of changing the layer attributes in After Effects. They can create adaptable rigs and automate repetitive processes. Because of this, developing and modifying the code should be a breeze. There are many phrases that already exist and have for many years, but finding them might be challenging if you aren’t sure what you’re searching for. They may be as small as a single word or integer, or very complicated, including chapters and paragraphs of code.</p>
<p>You may begin forming connections between a property and other layers when you write an expression on that property. By connecting the expressions to the numerical parameters, the expression controllers in the Effects &amp; Presets panel may assist you in better controlling the expressions. Although they are by no means necessary, expressions come in quite handy when attempting to replicate effects like inertia or bouncing without having to specify a ton of extra keyframes. They not only provide many creative possibilities, but they may also streamline your motion design process.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Common-Expressions-in-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Part-2-Common-Expressions-in-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Common Expressions in After Effects"></a>Part 2. Common Expressions in After Effects</h2><p>An expression is a brief piece of JavaScript code that can be plugged into animated properties in After Effects applications. Expressions evaluate to a single value for a single layer property at a particular instant in time. Below are a few popular expressions.</p>
<h3 id="1-‘thisComp’-1"><a href="#1-‘thisComp’-1" class="headerlink" title="1. ‘thisComp’"></a>1. ‘thisComp’</h3><p>Expressions in After Effects revolve entirely on manipulating values inside an object hierarchy. Objects in this context include the composition, specific layers, and even effects. Values or other things may be contained by an object.</p>
<p>Use thisComp together with some fundamental arithmetic to precisely place things on the screen. This comes in quite helpful when exporting several versions for social media sites and reusing content. To have the logo scale in accordance with the size of the comp, you could even add a similar statement to the Scale option.</p>
<h3 id="2-‘loopOut’-1"><a href="#2-‘loopOut’-1" class="headerlink" title="2. ‘loopOut’"></a>2. ‘loopOut’</h3><p>You can always simply copy and paste keyframes throughout the timeline if you want an animation to repeat. But if you wanted to make adjustments, you’d have to go back and deal with all of those keyframes again. Again, you’d never see Batman using After Effects accomplishing this. You should use the loopOut expression in these circumstances. Even four options may be used to modify how the animation loops.</p>
<p>Again, cycle is the default setting; however, you may also choose from continue, offset, and ping pong. It just requires animating an Ellipse’s Scale and Opacity properties, then adding loopOut to each of them. The two keyframes are immediately cycled; it is plug and play. There are really just four keyframes in total, however the animation lasts the full length of the timeline. Use two keyframes per parameter to keep things simple, or specify which keyframes you want to loop to make things more complicated.</p>
<h3 id="3-‘random’-1"><a href="#3-‘random’-1" class="headerlink" title="3. ‘random’"></a>3. ‘random’</h3><p>As implied by the name, each frame’s value is generated randomly by this expression based on the argument you provide. It will automatically randomize between 0 and 1 if you leave it empty. The parameter will generate a value at random between 0 and the value you provide between the parentheses. It will generate random numbers between the two values you enter.</p>
<p>Another excellent expression for rapidly producing an animation is this one. We often use it to make opacity transitions that flicker. It just takes a few clicks to do this by adding the phrase below to Opacity and keyframing it in and out from 100% Opacity.</p>
<h3 id="4-‘Wiggle’-1"><a href="#4-‘Wiggle’-1" class="headerlink" title="4. ‘Wiggle’"></a>4. ‘Wiggle’</h3><p>One of the few expressions that may be used without keyframes is the Wiggle expression. Watch your shape begin to wiggle by simply adding the phrase to any Transform attribute. It will jiggle between keyframes if you decide to add them.</p>
<p>You will simultaneously move in two dimensions while using this phrase. You may sometimes just need to jiggle one dimension. The After Effects Wiggle expression (also known as AE Wiggle) is an excellent tool for creating erratic item movement, idle character movement, unpredictable camera motion, shaky lettering, and flashing lights.</p>
<h3 id="5-‘Time’-1"><a href="#5-‘Time’-1" class="headerlink" title="5. ‘Time’"></a>5. ‘Time’</h3><p>The greater the value next to “time” below, the quicker your animation will be. Time expression is useful for continuous animation. Utilizing time is one of the fastest and simplest methods to create an animation. Time just creates each second’s numerical value in the timeline. Remember that regardless of the timecode settings, this number begins at zero at the beginning of the comp.</p>
<p>Again, combine this with some simple arithmetic for excellent outcomes. To find a multiplier value that works for the parameter you are animating, play around and explore. Use it to gradually modify a layer’s position or rotation. Time is also very useful for driving animated textures like the Fractal or Turbulent Noise effects. The evolution parameter is increased by a factor of 100 throughout time.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Add-Expressions-in-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Add-Expressions-in-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Add Expressions in After Effects"></a>Part 3. How to Add Expressions in After Effects</h2><p>In Adobe AE, expressions may be added to any kind of layer and any form of layer attribute. Don’t give up; one of the best things about expressions is that you don’t have to be an expert programmer or coder to use them. A variety of transform effects may have expressions applied to them to generate fascinating animation, which might take hours to create from scratch.</p>
<p>While some idioms are brief, simple, and easy to use and comprehend, others are wordy and complex. Even though they can appear difficult, sticking them in their designated spot should work. The process of adding expressions is always the same; the code varies based on your goals. Learning how to apply an Expression effect to your layer is the first step.</p>
<p>Step1 Include your form or image in the timeline. When viewing the layer’s properties, click on the stopwatch of the property you wish to apply the phrase to while holding “Alt” (PC) or “Option” (Mac).</p>
<p><img

A green colored indicative light will mark the spot where the images are being dropped. You are free to drop all the images at the same time and sort them at a later stage.

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Adjust Image Pans and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Having included the desired images within the slideshow project, it is now time to improvise them with classic and enhanced looks. You can adhere to the task by making suitable changes under the ‘Video Adjustments’, ‘Crop Tool’ and ‘Clock’ options. Drag the cursor to a desired slide to see all the 3 options pop up at the top your slide screen.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Video Adjustment Tool</strong></p>
<p>Using the ‘Video Adjustment’ option, you are granted the liberty to adjust the brightness, contrast, white point, exposure, saturation and levels of the added images. If your images have an appreciable quality by default, you can skip this step.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Crop Tool</strong></p>
<p>Consider working with the ‘Crop Tool’ to zoom or pan the system camera across a selected slide. Click on the ‘Fit’ option to set the image within a chosen frame size; however you need to be cautious lest using the tool may render an incorrectly cropped image. Select the ‘Crop’ option to adjust the image aspect ratio according to your specific size constraints.</p>
<p>The ‘Ken Burns’ tool, you can rely on this one to spark the slideshow images with the coolest zoom and pan effects.

When you are satisfied with your work, hit ‘Done’ to return and confirm the changes, or click on the next presentation slide to crop and pan the same.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Clock Tool</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Clock’ icon lets you adjust the screen time of each slide, assigning a preset minimum duration of 0.25 seconds to each slide. Setting a play duration somewhere between 2-2.5 seconds would be an optimal choice. Avoid choosing shorter slide duration unless it becomes an obvious requirement, lest the audience may find it hard to process the contents.</p>
<p>Prefer adjusting the screen time separately for each slide, in case you have a large project with more than 50 slides. It is instead, advisable to time the entire project under one time frame, while setting a longer screen time for the title slide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add an Upbeat Background Audio</strong></p>
<p>Adding background music to your presentation slides is pretty simple, with you having to just position the audio files within the desired slides using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. The slides containing music pieces will have a ‘Light Green’ highlighting box under them. To correct a wrong placement, drag the audio file across the individual slides and drop at the correct space. You can further, modify the length of the audio clips by extending and trimming them.</p>
<p>To import audio files from your online iTunes account, navigate to and click within the ‘Music and Sound Effects’ box at the bottom right corner of the editor timeline. You can also clip the music file to start playing the background audio from a certain point within the track. To do this, take the cursor to the end of the track and drag the red indicator line to the point where you wish the audio to end at or begin playing from.</p>

Setting a play duration somewhere between 2-2.5 seconds would be an optimal choice. Avoid choosing shorter slide duration unless it becomes an obvious requirement, lest the audience may find it hard to process the contents.</p>
<p>Prefer adjusting the screen time separately for each slide, in case you have a large project with more than 50 slides. It is instead, advisable to time the entire project under one time frame, while setting a longer screen time for the title slide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add an Upbeat Background Audio</strong></p>

            <h2 id="This-Article-Aims-to-Show-You-How-to-Improve-Your-Lighting-in-the-Sun"><a href="#This-Article-Aims-to-Show-You-How-to-Improve-Your-Lighting-in-the-Sun" class="headerlink" title="This Article Aims to Show You How to Improve Your Lighting in the Sun"></a>This Article Aims to Show You How to Improve Your Lighting in the Sun</h2><p>Shooting outdoors is a challenge in most situations. We have to deal with the sun being overexposed or the background is too dark.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll show you how to light with the sun the easiest way. These simple and effective tips can help you block the harsh sun and make it to your advantage!</p>
<h2 id="1-Preparation"><a href="#1-Preparation" class="headerlink" title="1) Preparation"></a>1) Preparation</h2><p>You may need those things to film under the harsh sun:</p>
<ol>
<li>An ND filter for your lens</li>
<li>A flag to block the sun. It can be anything like a black poster.</li>
<li>A white poster to bounce the sunlight.</li>
<li>Artificial light equipment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let’s see when and how to use them against the strong sunlight!</p>
<h2 id="2-Direct-to-the-Sun"><a href="#2-Direct-to-the-Sun" class="headerlink" title="2) Direct to the Sun"></a>2) Direct to the Sun</h2><p>If we want a specific background for our shot but our talent has to face the sun, here are some tips you can do to undermine the unflattering light or the blindness.</p>
<p><strong>1. Pick up an ND filter on your lens</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/len.jpg"
                      alt="pick up an nd filter on lens"
                ></p>
<p>We use it outside so we can open our aperture to get nice blurry backgrounds without overexposing our footage.</p>
<p><strong>2. Use a “flag” to block or shape the sunlight</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/black-flag.jpg"
                      alt="black flag"
                ></p>
<p>Using a black piece of poster board works perfectly fine, hold it up to the sun. Also, remember to angle your “flag” to create harsh lines or fully shade your talent.</p>
<p><strong>3. Adjust your camera to fit the environment</strong></p>
<p>For example, you can change the exposure of your camera to match the talent’s face giving a more silhouette look.</p>
<h2 id="3-Back-to-the-Sun"><a href="#3-Back-to-the-Sun" class="headerlink" title="3) Back to the Sun"></a>3) Back to the Sun</h2><p>Have you ever been filming outside only to see your talent dark in the frame with the background blown out with light? To fix the problem, the simplest way is to use a “bounce”.</p>
<p>By using a “bounce”, we can reflect the light from the sun to our talent. Make sure to lift the bounce and move it around to get the right amount of light on your talent.</p>
<p>This should give us a nice look with the sun backlighting our subject and the bounce filling in the shadows and giving us soft light on our talent’s face!</p>
<h2 id="4-Artificial-lighting"><a href="#4-Artificial-lighting" class="headerlink" title="4) Artificial lighting"></a>4) Artificial lighting</h2><p>If we want to control our lighting better, we will want to use artificial lights in combination with the sun.</p>
<p>For example, weather changes. As you shot, the sun will move and make lighting challenging to keep consistent.</p>
<p>In that case, we can use the <strong>flag technique</strong> that we used before to block the harsh sunlight and then use our lights on our talent’s face, this keeps our lighting more consistent than if we relied on just the natural light.</p>
<p>Now, take a look at the comparison with all the lighting conditions we create:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flag VS Flag &amp; Light</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="flag vs flag light"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Backlight VS Backlight &amp; Bounce</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>

Talking of the most recent add-ons to the already long list of utilities, storyboards have emerged as a revolution in the field of motion graphic customization and design.</p>
<p>Diving a bit deeper into understanding the credibility of storyboards, let us move ahead with having an insight of different aspects and elements of the same in the upcoming sections of this article:</p>
<p><strong>What is a Storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>Attempting to define a <strong>storyboard</strong>, you can regard the utility as a sequential setup of sketches, images, elements and illustrations that create a road map to address a video editing task. Dividing the entire process into a series of individual processes, the aforesaid facility caters to ease out the video creation task.</p>
<p>Moving ahead to draft a technical explanation of storyboards, they are a collection of chronologically arranged drawings, supplemented with video customization elements, such as dialogues, camera direction and other allied detailing. The fundamental merit of these visual arrangements lies in the sequential and scene unfolding of a video footage.</p>
<p>This in turn, works to simplify the film creation process, while ensuring the latter’s cohesiveness and facilitating the elimination of errors and inconsistencies. It is a common mistake to regard storyboards as a midway and optional utility, these trial and error representations are quite essential to ensure a flawless video output in the final stage of design. The facility works additionally to minimize unnecessary production delays, while significantly cutting down on the overall creation cost.</p>
<p>Having a visibility more or less similar to a comic strip, storyboards have a varying scale of design, ranging from being modestly simple to explicitly complex, in cohesion with the specific creation requirements. These visual scripts are mostly hand crafted, through there are a host of storyboard creation software packages and programs available in the IT design market, as well as across the web.</p>
<p>Extending our discussion a bit further, let us have a walk-through of the essential storyboard categories and types in what follows next:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Traditional Storyboards</strong></p>

While the utility works to define a sequential arrangement of shots and elements in a specific video scene, the real effort lies in converting a text centered movie or scene script into a storyboard. Talking of the ways to address this concern, let us discuss about these storyboard essentials in some detail in what follows next:</p>
<p><strong>What Comes First – Script or Storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>Before beginning to comment on the sequence of the aforesaid elements within a film production process, let us first proceed to have an understanding of the terms in a fundamental sense. A script is essentially a text based document that presents a cumulative picture of the video story by unveiling the latter’s storyline and theme. Storyboards on the other hand, are pictorial representations of sequentially arranged shots of the movie with a much more comprehensive detailing.</p>
<p>Going through the above definitions, the obvious and logical sequence of filming out a video is quite clear with scripts preceding the storyboards. Talking a bit on the credibility aspect of these video production stages, the film’s script caters to provide an elementary insight into some of the most essential visual commands. Crafting a storyboard on the other hand, is dedicated towards depicting a detailed follow through of each shot in line with the events described in the script.</p>
<p>Working towards a classic and professional video production task, hence demands a drafting of the latter’s script, which is then succeeded by crafting a storyboard. This facilitates a seamless and easy video creation process with lesser ambiguities. Having talked enough about scripts and storyboards, let us now move ahead with creating storyboards from a film script in the following section:</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Let’s Start Storyboarding!</strong></p>
<p>Move ahead to planning the sequential placement of shots and scenes of the story in line with the script that you have just created. It is a great idea to pick an array of 4-6 movement shots for a particular scene, so that you can have a sufficient cell spacing to expand the detailing of shot elements. This further caters to a convenient and spatial arrangement of the cells on a standard sized paper.</p>
<p>You can now start to create your storyboard by adding labels to the scenes, penning down the directions, including the specific character dialogues and suitable images.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Prefer Numbering the Storyboard Panels</strong></p>
<p>Since the storyboard you are creating works as a blueprint for the video creation team, it should be convenient to understand and navigate through. Presenting the cells of your storyboard in a numbered sequence tends to provide an easy follow through of the same to the rest of your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Explore Your Imagination</strong></p>
<p>Your storyboard happens to be the inaugural representation of your video production idea and script in front of the potential audience. You should hence, proceed with the latter’s crafting process while keeping a close reference with the drafted script. Also, it becomes greatly important to add the imaginative element to your creation to avoid creating an bland and customary impression on the audience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Feedback Has a Great Importance</strong></p>
<p>Make sure to showcase your storyboard to your project investors, prior to beginning with the film creation process. This will aid you with an escape from the unnecessary changes that can pop out from the audience at the last minute, leading to an unwanted financial expense. Pay attention to gather and work on the feedback of the viewers and start the actual creation process only after everything seems to be well settled.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Enjoy Your Work</strong></p>
<p>Enjoying the different aspects of your work is the key to achieve mastery at your craft and a welcoming response from the audience. Accepted that the storyboarding process is mind straining and time consuming, but taking on the challenge with a fun centered attitude will let your hard work shine on in front of the viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Storyboards with Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Creating storyboards in the traditional paper and pencil format is undoubtedly an absolute fun activity, but it has the limitations of a customary image drawing. If you want to supplement the contents of your storyboard with additional elements of animations, effects, background themes and music, it would be better to work with storyboard creator software.</p>
<p>Browsing through the heap of alternatives across the web and the IT market, you can conveniently choose to work with the Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> to address the concern.

<p>When aiming to quickly address the concern of creating storyboards, picking up an online template is a better option in comparison to the traditional pencil and paper drawing. As of working with the web based alternatives, you can add sketches, scripts and notes within the storyboard cells to make them more impressive and detailed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What should be the ideal expanse of a storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule to decide the optimum number of cells or pages for your storyboard. The page count may have variations in line with the content and detailing of the scenes they are crafted to showcase.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Is it essential to include every shot within the storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>On a general note, every shot within your script does not require an inclusion within the storyboard. The answer to this query however, largely depends on the intensity of detailing you wish to add and the diversity of ideas and elements you want to incorporate within the storyboard of a specific film scene.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What are the essentials of a good storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>When attempting to create a good storyboard, pay attention to the fluent transition of the text centered ideas into pictorial representations. Your video script should possess the right quantity of information to make anyone easily understand the content depiction without having a prior walk-through of your script. Abstain from creating an information overflow either, lest you would end up hiding away the relevant details.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What are the major parts of a storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>A well-crafted storyboard comprises of 4 important elements. There are namely, the subject of the shot or scene, a suitable and cohesive background, a properly angled camera shot of the main character within the scene and a responsive camera movement.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> When turning your text based script into a storyboard, pay enough heed towards assuring a seamless transition of words into relevant images.</p>

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Import the FLV video and add it to timeline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Click on ‘**<em>Import Media Files</em>**’ and import the flv video into project media from your computer’s file explorer. Then add the video to the timeline by dragging it inside the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Edit and perform desired modifications (Optional)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are just looking to resize the FLV video file, then you can skip this step and move to step no. 4. Otherwise, you can do various editings on the video like cropping, muting, trimming, animating, etc. before resizing the video. Filmora provides a wide range of features for editing and adding effects to the video.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘<strong>resizing video</strong>’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the <strong><em>File</em></strong> and then to the <strong><em>Project Settings</em></strong><em>.</em> Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resize the video by cropping</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.</p>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Adjust the file size of the video through export settings</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After you’ve cropped and resized the Flv video, you need to export it by clicking the <strong><em>Export</em></strong> button on the top center part. There are different settings available for exporting the video. Click on the <strong><em>Settings</em></strong> button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.</p>

Previously, this was a major issue due to a lack of good video editors for android with flv support but that’s no longer the case. Below are two ways to resize FLV videos on android:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inshot</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>InShot is a powerful all-in-one video editor for android which acts both as a basic video editor as well as an advanced video editor with its simple design yet powerful features. There aren’t many video editors in Android that supports Flv or some older codecs, but InShot is one of the very few editors that support these video formats. It is a paid app but also has a limited free version to try.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to resize FLV videos on Android with InShot:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Inshot app on your android device and click on <strong>Video</strong>.</li>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-1.jpg"
                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Import the FLV video and add it to timeline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Click on ‘**<em>Import Media Files</em>**’ and import the flv video into project media from your computer’s file explorer. Then add the video to the timeline by dragging it inside the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-2.jpg"
                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Edit and perform desired modifications (Optional)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are just looking to resize the FLV video file, then you can skip this step and move to step no. 4. Otherwise, you can do various editings on the video like cropping, muting, trimming, animating, etc. before resizing the video. Filmora provides a wide range of features for editing and adding effects to the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-3.jpg"
                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘<strong>resizing video</strong>’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the <strong><em>File</em></strong> and then to the <strong><em>Project Settings</em></strong><em>.</em> Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resize the video by cropping</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Adjust the file size of the video through export settings</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After you’ve cropped and resized the Flv video, you need to export it by clicking the <strong><em>Export</em></strong> button on the top center part. There are different settings available for exporting the video. Click on the <strong><em>Settings</em></strong> button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.</p>

Previously, this was a major issue due to a lack of good video editors for android with flv support but that’s no longer the case. Below are two ways to resize FLV videos on android:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inshot</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>InShot is a powerful all-in-one video editor for android which acts both as a basic video editor as well as an advanced video editor with its simple design yet powerful features.

It is a paid app but also has a limited free version to try.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to resize FLV videos on Android with InShot:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Import the FLV video and add it to timeline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Click on ‘**<em>Import Media Files</em>**’ and import the flv video into project media from your computer’s file explorer. Then add the video to the timeline by dragging it inside the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Edit and perform desired modifications (Optional)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are just looking to resize the FLV video file, then you can skip this step and move to step no. 4.

Filmora provides a wide range of features for editing and adding effects to the video.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘<strong>resizing video</strong>’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the <strong><em>File</em></strong> and then to the <strong><em>Project Settings</em></strong><em>.</em> Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resize the video by cropping</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.</p>

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Adjust the file size of the video through export settings</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After you’ve cropped and resized the Flv video, you need to export it by clicking the <strong><em>Export</em></strong> button on the top center part. There are different settings available for exporting the video. Click on the <strong><em>Settings</em></strong> button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Edit and perform desired modifications (Optional)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are just looking to resize the FLV video file, then you can skip this step and move to step no. 4.

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘<strong>resizing video</strong>’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the <strong><em>File</em></strong> and then to the <strong><em>Project Settings</em></strong><em>.</em> Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resize the video by cropping</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.</p>

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Adjust the file size of the video through export settings</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After you’ve cropped and resized the Flv video, you need to export it by clicking the <strong><em>Export</em></strong> button on the top center part. There are different settings available for exporting the video. Click on the <strong><em>Settings</em></strong> button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.</p>

<h2 id="FAQs-about-Resizing-FLV-Video-3"><a href="#FAQs-about-Resizing-FLV-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="FAQs about Resizing FLV Video"></a><strong>FAQs about Resizing FLV Video</strong></h2><p>Here are some of the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) related to resizing FLV videos that you might be interested in:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How do I make FLV files smaller?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can make FLV files smaller with the help of any video editor that supports Flv video format by cutting and cropping out unnecessary parts, decreasing the resolution, and bitrate, and converting flv into another lighter file format.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Which video editors support FLV file format?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are few video editors like Filmora, Movavi, VSDC, etc. that support the FLV file format. But when it comes to editing FLV videos, Filmora Video Editor is the best choice.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How do I view an FLV file?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>FLV is one of the oldest video formats due to which most new and modern video players don’t recognize it or can’t play it. However, there are few programs like VLC media players which can help you view an FLV file. Or you can also convert the FLV file into other supported video formats with the help of a video converter.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Can I convert a horizontal FLV video into a vertical one?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, and that’s a piece of cake when you use Filmora Video Editor or other similar video editors. You just need to change the aspect ratio of the video or the project from horizontal (generally 16:9) to vertical (generally 9:16).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Can I resize FLV video files on my mobile?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Though video editors on mobile are not as powerful as those on PC, there are some that are still capable enough to let you easily resize FLV video files on mobile devices. Some examples are InShot, Splice, Powerdirector, etc.</p>

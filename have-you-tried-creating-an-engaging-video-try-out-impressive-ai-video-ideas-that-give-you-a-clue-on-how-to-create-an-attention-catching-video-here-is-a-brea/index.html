While many users record the entire video in slow motion, there are others who need only a particular section of a clip to play at a reduced speed. Nevertheless, slowing down footage is no longer rocket science, thanks to the advancements in technology, and the availability and ease of access to relevant apps.</p>
<p>That said, here you will learn what is needed to record a video in slow motion, and how to get the job done in a simple way. In addition, you will also learn how to reduce the playback speed of an already existing video if it was recorded at a normal pace.</p>

Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.</p>
<p>For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the <strong>SLO-MO</strong> mode.</p>

<p>Speed Ramping enables you to add the slow-motion effect at different parts of a video and even freeze the screen for the duration that you specify. The processes to get these done are given below in detail:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add Source Video to Timeline and Get to the Speed Ramping Window</strong></p>
<p>Use the process given in the previous method to import a source video to Wondershare Filmora 11 and add it to the Timeline. Then use the process given in the second step of the previous method to get to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Slow Motion Effect to Different Parts of the Clip</strong></p>

Optionally, you can click any of the available presets to automatically add the slow-motion effect to the video.</p>
<p>Note: You can also drag the adjustment points above the line to increase the playback speed.</p>
<p>To add an adjustment point on the frame where it is not already present, place the playhead (skimmer) at the correct position, and click <strong>Add Adjust Point</strong> from the left of the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window itself. Once added, you can drag it downward to reduce the playback speed of that part of the clip.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-When-to-Use-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Part-3-When-to-Use-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?"></a>Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?</h2><p>There could be many instances when you want to add a slow-motion effect to your videos. Some of the most common ones include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Focus</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skill or Style Demonstration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replays</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Suspense</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.</p>
<p>In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.</p>

<p>Speed Ramping enables you to add the slow-motion effect at different parts of a video and even freeze the screen for the duration that you specify. The processes to get these done are given below in detail:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add Source Video to Timeline and Get to the Speed Ramping Window</strong></p>
<p>Use the process given in the previous method to import a source video to Wondershare Filmora 11 and add it to the Timeline. Then use the process given in the second step of the previous method to get to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Slow Motion Effect to Different Parts of the Clip</strong></p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> tab if it is not already selected, click <strong>Custom</strong> from the available options, and drag the adjustment points below the center line to reduce the playback speed for that particular section of the clip. Optionally, you can click any of the available presets to automatically add the slow-motion effect to the video.</p>
<p>Note: You can also drag the adjustment points above the line to increase the playback speed.</p>
<p>To add an adjustment point on the frame where it is not already present, place the playhead (skimmer) at the correct position, and click <strong>Add Adjust Point</strong> from the left of the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window itself. Once added, you can drag it downward to reduce the playback speed of that part of the clip.</p>

Some of the most common ones include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Focus</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skill or Style Demonstration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replays</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Suspense</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.</p>
<p>In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.</p>

Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.</p>
<p>For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the <strong>SLO-MO</strong> mode.</p>

<li><strong>Add Focus</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skill or Style Demonstration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replays</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Suspense</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.</p>
<p>In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.</p>

Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.</p>
<p>For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the <strong>SLO-MO</strong> mode.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Start and Stop Recording</strong></p>
<p>Tap the <strong>Record</strong> button from the bottom-center of the screen to begin recording the video in slow motion. Tap <strong>Stop</strong> when you are done. You can access the recorded video from the <strong>Videos</strong> container of the <strong>Photos</strong> app in your iPhone.</p>

They provide you with the essential tools to make the best GIFs out of any video you want.</p>
<p>So here is a step-by-step method to help you make your GIFs in Photoshop and impress your friends.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: One of the most important steps is to choose the video you want to use in your GIF. GIFs are supposed to be short and express what you want to in that concise sequence, and that’s why choosing a correct sequence of the right length is very important.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now you will have to download the video file to your computer and continue to trim it down to as few frames as possible, and choose the frames that convey the message as accurately as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Import the video to Photoshop by going to “File” &gt; “Import” &gt; “Video frames to layers.” Choose the video file you need, and it will appear in the form of separate frames. Now you can select whether you want the entire video or small bits of it; you can also limit the import to any frame to manage the size and time of the video. You can choose different color gradients and many other things according to your preference. And then go to “file” and select “save for web.”</p>

<p>So here is a step-by-step method to help you make your GIFs in Photoshop and impress your friends.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: One of the most important steps is to choose the video you want to use in your GIF. GIFs are supposed to be short and express what you want to in that concise sequence, and that’s why choosing a correct sequence of the right length is very important.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now you will have to download the video file to your computer and continue to trim it down to as few frames as possible, and choose the frames that convey the message as accurately as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Import the video to Photoshop by going to “File” &gt; “Import” &gt; “Video frames to layers.” Choose the video file you need, and it will appear in the form of separate frames. Now you can select whether you want the entire video or small bits of it; you can also limit the import to any frame to manage the size and time of the video. You can choose different color gradients and many other things according to your preference. And then go to “file” and select “save for web.”</p>

They provide you with the essential tools to make the best GIFs out of any video you want.</p>
<p>So here is a step-by-step method to help you make your GIFs in Photoshop and impress your friends.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: One of the most important steps is to choose the video you want to use in your GIF. GIFs are supposed to be short and express what you want to in that concise sequence, and that’s why choosing a correct sequence of the right length is very important.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now you will have to download the video file to your computer and continue to trim it down to as few frames as possible, and choose the frames that convey the message as accurately as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Import the video to Photoshop by going to “File” &gt; “Import” &gt; “Video frames to layers.” Choose the video file you need, and it will appear in the form of separate frames. Now you can select whether you want the entire video or small bits of it; you can also limit the import to any frame to manage the size and time of the video. You can choose different color gradients and many other things according to your preference. And then go to “file” and select “save for web.”</p>

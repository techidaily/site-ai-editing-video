<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>Step 1: Launch <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to begin. Import the targeted music in the program and drag it to the timeline. Now, trim the music to 30 seconds and listen to the end part. Select the last note to match the beat in the beginning part of the music.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-1.jpg"
                      alt="match note with the music"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Moving on, add markers to the music. Use “M” from the keyboard to mark the specific part of the track. After you are done, drag the first track onto the timeline. Trim the video to match it to the first marker.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-2.jpg"
                      alt="add markers and adjust video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Perform a similar process for the rest of the video clips and trim them according to the markers. The user is directed to create a 2.35:1 widescreen cinemascope bar opener. To do so, drag two black mattes onto the timeline on top of each other.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-3.jpg"
                      alt="create widescreen cinemascope bar opener"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Drag the end of both clips to match the length of the whole video. Now, it is time to animate it. Insert 240° in the y-axis for the first keyframe. Similarly, use 422.2° for the second keyframe. For the bottom y-axis, use -240° for the first keyframe and -422.2° for the second keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-4.jpg"
                      alt="match length of whole video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: After the animation is completed, head to the “Titles” tab and look for cinematic packs. Choose one and drag it onto the timeline. Secondly, alter the duration and animation of the title. The user is expected to insert a dissolve transition at the end of the title.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-5.jpg"
                      alt="adjust title of the video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6: Perform the same process for the rest of the tracks. Time the titles to match the clip’s ending. Now, add a dissolve transition at the end of the clip. Trim the clip into two parts and apply square blur by navigating to the “Effects” tab to blur the video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-6.jpg"
                      alt="add dissolve transition and effects"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7: Moving on, adjust the alpha for blur intensity. Add a dissolve transition between the cuts. In the final step, go to the “Animation” and then “Customize.” Reframe the last clip and animate a zoom-out effect. Reduce the “Scale” percent to do so. A creative cinematic intro is ready!</p>

<p>For this very reason, the article conveys a guide to creating a powerful cinematic intro. Let us begin this!</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>Step 1: Launch <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to begin. Import the targeted music in the program and drag it to the timeline. Now, trim the music to 30 seconds and listen to the end part. Select the last note to match the beat in the beginning part of the music.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Moving on, add markers to the music. Use “M” from the keyboard to mark the specific part of the track. After you are done, drag the first track onto the timeline. Trim the video to match it to the first marker.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add markers and adjust video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Perform a similar process for the rest of the video clips and trim them according to the markers. The user is directed to create a 2.35:1 widescreen cinemascope bar opener. To do so, drag two black mattes onto the timeline on top of each other.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create widescreen cinemascope bar opener"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Drag the end of both clips to match the length of the whole video. Now, it is time to animate it. Insert 240° in the y-axis for the first keyframe. Similarly, use 422.2° for the second keyframe. For the bottom y-axis, use -240° for the first keyframe and -422.2° for the second keyframe.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="match length of whole video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: After the animation is completed, head to the “Titles” tab and look for cinematic packs. Choose one and drag it onto the timeline. Secondly, alter the duration and animation of the title. The user is expected to insert a dissolve transition at the end of the title.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="adjust title of the video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6: Perform the same process for the rest of the tracks. Time the titles to match the clip’s ending. Now, add a dissolve transition at the end of the clip. Trim the clip into two parts and apply square blur by navigating to the “Effects” tab to blur the video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add dissolve transition and effects"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7: Moving on, adjust the alpha for blur intensity. Add a dissolve transition between the cuts. In the final step, go to the “Animation” and then “Customize.” Reframe the last clip and animate a zoom-out effect. Reduce the “Scale” percent to do so. A creative cinematic intro is ready!</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>Step 1: Launch <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to begin. Import the targeted music in the program and drag it to the timeline. Now, trim the music to 30 seconds and listen to the end part. Select the last note to match the beat in the beginning part of the music.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="match note with the music"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Moving on, add markers to the music. Use “M” from the keyboard to mark the specific part of the track. After you are done, drag the first track onto the timeline. Trim the video to match it to the first marker.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-2.jpg"
                      alt="add markers and adjust video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Perform a similar process for the rest of the video clips and trim them according to the markers. The user is directed to create a 2.35:1 widescreen cinemascope bar opener. To do so, drag two black mattes onto the timeline on top of each other.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create widescreen cinemascope bar opener"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Drag the end of both clips to match the length of the whole video. Now, it is time to animate it. Insert 240° in the y-axis for the first keyframe. Similarly, use 422.2° for the second keyframe. For the bottom y-axis, use -240° for the first keyframe and -422.2° for the second keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="match length of whole video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: After the animation is completed, head to the “Titles” tab and look for cinematic packs. Choose one and drag it onto the timeline. Secondly, alter the duration and animation of the title. The user is expected to insert a dissolve transition at the end of the title.</p>

                      alt="adjust title of the video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6: Perform the same process for the rest of the tracks. Time the titles to match the clip’s ending. Now, add a dissolve transition at the end of the clip. Trim the clip into two parts and apply square blur by navigating to the “Effects” tab to blur the video clips.</p>

                      alt="add dissolve transition and effects"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7: Moving on, adjust the alpha for blur intensity. Add a dissolve transition between the cuts. In the final step, go to the “Animation” and then “Customize.” Reframe the last clip and animate a zoom-out effect. Reduce the “Scale” percent to do so. A creative cinematic intro is ready!</p>

Although there are several QuickTime format files that you may come across and play across the platform, it only converts any video file into MOV format, which is the dedicated file format potentially designed by Apple. To understand the method to convert any QuickTime video format to MOV format, follow the steps shown below:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open the appropriate video across QuickTime to convert it accordingly. Once opened, tap on the “File” tab, and select “Export as” across the available options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="access export as option"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: You need to select an appropriate resolution from the available options according to the video quality that you want the video to be saved in on the preceding menu. QuickTime player will show low-quality resolutions for the high-quality video but not vice versa.</p>

                      alt="choose video quality"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: A new window opens that requires you to set up the name and location for the video. Add the file extension “.mov” at the end of the name of the video to convert it into MOV format.</p>

<p>Step 1: You need to open the appropriate video across QuickTime to convert it accordingly. Once opened, tap on the “File” tab, and select “Export as” across the available options.</p>

Two basic techniques can be implemented to play videos with QuickTime. The first method to play videos with QuickTime are featured as follows:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open QuickTime Player across your Mac. For that, proceed across Launchpad to access the application.</p>

                      alt="select quicktime player"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Once the player is launched, you can simply select any video across the window that opens up. Once selected, tap “Open” to play it across QuickTime.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="tap on open button"
                ></p>
<p>Sounds easy, right? However, if you have multiple videos to open or have other video players installed in your Mac, you should consider following this second approach. If QuickTime Player is not your default video player, it is important to follow the steps below for opening any video across QuickTime.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open Finder on your device and proceed to locate the video that you wish to open across QuickTime. On finding the video, click on the video while holding the “Control” button on the keyboard. This opens a drop-down menu.</p>

To understand the step-by-step procedure, you need to follow the steps displayed below. Come along and learn more about it.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open QuickTime Player on your device and tap on the “File” tab on the top of the screen. Select the option of “New Screen Recording” from the available options to initiate screen recording.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="select new screen recording option"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: The next window opens up, which involves managing the screen recording settings. You need to set up the screen area recorded in the process initially.</p>

<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Convert-Video-File-to-MOV-Format-in-QuickTime-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Convert-Video-File-to-MOV-Format-in-QuickTime-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Convert Video File to MOV Format in QuickTime?"></a>Part 5: How to Convert Video File to MOV Format in QuickTime?</h2><p>QuickTime Player is not quite extensive when it comes to converting video files. Although there are several QuickTime format files that you may come across and play across the platform, it only converts any video file into MOV format, which is the dedicated file format potentially designed by Apple. To understand the method to convert any QuickTime video format to MOV format, follow the steps shown below:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open the appropriate video across QuickTime to convert it accordingly. Once opened, tap on the “File” tab, and select “Export as” across the available options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="access export as option"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: You need to select an appropriate resolution from the available options according to the video quality that you want the video to be saved in on the preceding menu. QuickTime player will show low-quality resolutions for the high-quality video but not vice versa.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="choose video quality"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: A new window opens that requires you to set up the name and location for the video. Add the file extension “.mov” at the end of the name of the video to convert it into MOV format.</p>

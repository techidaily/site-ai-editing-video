<li>In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you’ll have a new series to call your own.</li>
<li>Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.</li>
<li>The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed&#x2F;Duration from the context menu list.</li>
<li>Choose Clip&gt; Speed Duration instead from the program’s drop-down menu.</li>
<li>The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool"><a href="#Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool"></a>Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool</h3><p>Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie’s tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the application on your respective systems.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline’s left side to begin a timer.</li>
<li>You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.</li>
<li>Drag the video’s start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool"><a href="#Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Time Remapping Tool"></a>Method 3: Time Remapping Tool</h3><p>In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.</li>
<li>Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.</li>
<li>Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video’s frame rate lines may be found here.</li>
<li>A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can’t see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro</p>
<h3 id="Time-stretch"><a href="#Time-stretch" class="headerlink" title="Time stretch"></a>Time stretch</h3><p>A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.</p>
<p>To put it another way, you’d see 30 frames in a second that weren’t repeated. A second has been added to the video’s duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.</li>
<li>To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.</li>
<li>Right-clicking and choosing the Duration&#x2F;Speed option causes the video to begin playing.</li>
<li>This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Using-Keyframes"><a href="#Using-Keyframes" class="headerlink" title="Using Keyframes"></a>Using Keyframes</h3><p>When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you’ll need to choose a specific video that you’d want to have slowed down.</li>
<li>After you’ve chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.</li>
<li>By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify &gt; Interpret from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>You’ll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Utlizing-Time-Remapping"><a href="#Utlizing-Time-Remapping" class="headerlink" title="Utlizing Time Remapping"></a>Utlizing Time Remapping</h3><p>The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you’d want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.</li>
<li>After dragging the video to the timeline, you’ll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.</li>
<li>Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video’s right-click menu.</li>
<li>Only the “Pen Tool” must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-1"><a href="#Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool"></a>Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool</h3><p>Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie’s tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the application on your respective systems.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline’s left side to begin a timer.</li>
<li>You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.</li>
<li>Drag the video’s start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-1"><a href="#Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Time Remapping Tool"></a>Method 3: Time Remapping Tool</h3><p>In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.</li>
<li>Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.</li>
<li>Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video’s frame rate lines may be found here.</li>
<li>A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can’t see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro</p>
<h3 id="Time-stretch-1"><a href="#Time-stretch-1" class="headerlink" title="Time stretch"></a>Time stretch</h3><p>A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.</p>
<p>To put it another way, you’d see 30 frames in a second that weren’t repeated. A second has been added to the video’s duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.</li>
<li>To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.</li>
<li>Right-clicking and choosing the Duration&#x2F;Speed option causes the video to begin playing.</li>
<li>This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Using-Keyframes-1"><a href="#Using-Keyframes-1" class="headerlink" title="Using Keyframes"></a>Using Keyframes</h3><p>When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you’ll need to choose a specific video that you’d want to have slowed down.</li>
<li>After you’ve chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.</li>
<li>By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify &gt; Interpret from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>You’ll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Utlizing-Time-Remapping-1"><a href="#Utlizing-Time-Remapping-1" class="headerlink" title="Utlizing Time Remapping"></a>Utlizing Time Remapping</h3><p>The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you’d want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.</li>
<li>After dragging the video to the timeline, you’ll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.</li>
<li>Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video’s right-click menu.</li>
<li>Only the “Pen Tool” must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the application on your respective systems.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline’s left side to begin a timer.</li>
<li>You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.</li>
<li>Drag the video’s start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-2"><a href="#Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Time Remapping Tool"></a>Method 3: Time Remapping Tool</h3><p>In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.</li>
<li>Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.</li>
<li>Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video’s frame rate lines may be found here.</li>
<li>A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can’t see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-2"><a href="#How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro</p>
<h3 id="Time-stretch-2"><a href="#Time-stretch-2" class="headerlink" title="Time stretch"></a>Time stretch</h3><p>A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.</p>
<p>To put it another way, you’d see 30 frames in a second that weren’t repeated. A second has been added to the video’s duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.</li>
<li>To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.</li>
<li>Right-clicking and choosing the Duration&#x2F;Speed option causes the video to begin playing.</li>
<li>This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Using-Keyframes-2"><a href="#Using-Keyframes-2" class="headerlink" title="Using Keyframes"></a>Using Keyframes</h3><p>When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you’ll need to choose a specific video that you’d want to have slowed down.</li>
<li>After you’ve chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.</li>
<li>By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify &gt; Interpret from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>You’ll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Utlizing-Time-Remapping-2"><a href="#Utlizing-Time-Remapping-2" class="headerlink" title="Utlizing Time Remapping"></a>Utlizing Time Remapping</h3><p>The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you’d want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.</li>
<li>After dragging the video to the timeline, you’ll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.</li>
<li>Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video’s right-click menu.</li>
<li>Only the “Pen Tool” must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.</li>
</ul>

<li>Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline’s left side to begin a timer.</li>
<li>You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.</li>
<li>Drag the video’s start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-3"><a href="#Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Time Remapping Tool"></a>Method 3: Time Remapping Tool</h3><p>In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.</li>
<li>Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.</li>
<li>Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video’s frame rate lines may be found here.</li>
<li>A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can’t see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro</p>
<h3 id="Time-stretch-3"><a href="#Time-stretch-3" class="headerlink" title="Time stretch"></a>Time stretch</h3><p>A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.</p>
<p>To put it another way, you’d see 30 frames in a second that weren’t repeated. A second has been added to the video’s duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.</li>
<li>To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.</li>
<li>Right-clicking and choosing the Duration&#x2F;Speed option causes the video to begin playing.</li>
<li>This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Using-Keyframes-3"><a href="#Using-Keyframes-3" class="headerlink" title="Using Keyframes"></a>Using Keyframes</h3><p>When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you’ll need to choose a specific video that you’d want to have slowed down.</li>
<li>After you’ve chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.</li>
<li>By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify &gt; Interpret from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>You’ll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Utlizing-Time-Remapping-3"><a href="#Utlizing-Time-Remapping-3" class="headerlink" title="Utlizing Time Remapping"></a>Utlizing Time Remapping</h3><p>The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you’d want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.</li>
<li>After dragging the video to the timeline, you’ll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.</li>
<li>Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video’s right-click menu.</li>
<li>Only the “Pen Tool” must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.</li>
</ul>

<p>If, on the other hand, you desire to work in the ‘Read Batch Files’ mode, navigate to the ‘Menu Bar’ at the top of the software interface and hit the ‘File’ tab. From the list of items that drops down, select the ‘Read Batch Files’ option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Mode Specific Software Operation</strong></p>
<p>If you are working in the ‘Input and Speak’ mode, you can proceed with typing or pasting a desired text within the ‘Text Window’ Another option is to open a desired text document or file directly from your system. As for working in the ‘Read Batch Files’ mode, you are allowed to manage your system’s text files through the ‘Open’, ‘Clear’ and ‘Delete’ buttons. You should however take caution to add all the files in a common language.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Language Selection</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Language List’ window and pick a preferred language to convert the text files into audio transcripts. Remember to choose the same conversion language as added of the ‘Text Window’ files in Step 2, lest you would end up getting an undesirable speech output.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Voice Selection</strong></p>
<p>As you complete Step 4, a series of preset text to speech voice alternatives present within your system for the preferred language will show up in the ‘Voice Window’. Proceed to select the voice type you like.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Read Aloud!</strong></p>
<p>After you have selected the voice, tap the ‘Speak’ button and start reading your text aloud. Amid the process, you will see the ‘Stop’, ‘Resume’ and ‘Pause’ buttons getting enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Save Your Transcription</strong></p>
<p>When you have finished reading the text, click on the ‘Stop’ button to end the transcription process. The ‘Save as Audio’ option gets enabled, allowing you to convert your text into speech in the MP3, OGG, WAV and FLAC file formats.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Customize Your Audio</strong></p>
<p>The Panopreter program lets you add suitable customizations to the transcribed audio to ensure affordable file size and sound quality. You can adjust the bit rate and sample rate to address the aforesaid concern. All you need to do is, head to the ‘Menu Options’ at the top of the app screen and select ‘Settings’.</p>
<p>Click on the ‘Audio Format’ option within the ‘Settings’ window pops up, followed by selecting a suitable format for the audio file. On most cases, the WAV format works best to address the output quality requirements in an affordable manner.</p>

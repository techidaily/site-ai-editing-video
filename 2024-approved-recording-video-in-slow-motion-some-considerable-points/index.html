It’s the only way to highlight important aspects of sports and action scenes. Recording in slow motion is not difficult when you will learn <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>how to record slow-motion video</strong></a>. Before learning, let’s understand important aspects you should look at while recording.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> For slow-motion video, choosing the right frame rate is crucial. A higher framerate, such as 120fps and 240fps, allows smoother playback. So, before recording, ensure that your camera supports a good framerate.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Maintaining high-resolution videos is important to get good quality. Usually, slow-motion footage uses 4K and HD (High Definition) resolution. Having a high video resolution means providing clarity in details in videos.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> It refers to the speed at which the camera closes and controls exposure. Adjust the shutter speed to faster mode to capture every crisp in slow motion. It will prevent motion blur and help in freezing fast-moving objects.</li>
<li><strong>Audio Consideration:</strong> You should know that recording slow motion will affect the original audio. Meanwhile, some cameras preserve the original sound. So, be prepared and test your camera’s audio speed to ease the editing process.</li>
<li><strong>Focus and Stability:</strong> Minimize your camera shake and enable a stabilizer or tripod. Stable footage is essential to enhance the video quality. Moreover, try to keep your main subject in camera focus. In this regard, you can use manual focus control if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Editing Software Compatibility:</strong> Another thing that you must consider is tool compatibility. It’s better to check it before recording so you will not regret it later. Check your editing tools are supporting the file format of the recorded slow-motion video.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong> The <strong>“</strong>No More Storage” sign is a nightmare when you have recorded a perfect shot. Slow-motion videos consume large storage because of high resolution and frame rate. Thus, consider this aspect before recording to avoid inconvenience and arrange storage media.</li>
</ul>

A phenomenon that arises here is, can we slow down the normally recorded video? The simple answer is yes. There are many editing apps designed for this purpose. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one such editing app to slow down the pre-recorded videos.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-2"><a href="#Step-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Access your Adobe Premiere Pro application and import a video in the timeline. Identify the frame rate of your video clip for a non-choppy playback.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2-2"><a href="#Step-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>The frame rate will tell you how much you need to slow down the video. To do so, use this “(Timeline Frame Rate ÷ Footage Frame Rate) x 100” formula. Before moving, analyze the slow motion you can add in your clip as per their frame rate.</p>

It’s the only way to highlight important aspects of sports and action scenes. Recording in slow motion is not difficult when you will learn <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>how to record slow-motion video</strong></a>. Before learning, let’s understand important aspects you should look at while recording.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> For slow-motion video, choosing the right frame rate is crucial. A higher framerate, such as 120fps and 240fps, allows smoother playback. So, before recording, ensure that your camera supports a good framerate.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Maintaining high-resolution videos is important to get good quality. Usually, slow-motion footage uses 4K and HD (High Definition) resolution. Having a high video resolution means providing clarity in details in videos.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> It refers to the speed at which the camera closes and controls exposure. Adjust the shutter speed to faster mode to capture every crisp in slow motion. It will prevent motion blur and help in freezing fast-moving objects.</li>
<li><strong>Audio Consideration:</strong> You should know that recording slow motion will affect the original audio. Meanwhile, some cameras preserve the original sound. So, be prepared and test your camera’s audio speed to ease the editing process.</li>
<li><strong>Focus and Stability:</strong> Minimize your camera shake and enable a stabilizer or tripod. Stable footage is essential to enhance the video quality. Moreover, try to keep your main subject in camera focus. In this regard, you can use manual focus control if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Editing Software Compatibility:</strong> Another thing that you must consider is tool compatibility. It’s better to check it before recording so you will not regret it later. Check your editing tools are supporting the file format of the recorded slow-motion video.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong> The <strong>“</strong>No More Storage” sign is a nightmare when you have recorded a perfect shot. Slow-motion videos consume large storage because of high resolution and frame rate. Thus, consider this aspect before recording to avoid inconvenience and arrange storage media.</li>
</ul>

A phenomenon that arises here is, can we slow down the normally recorded video? The simple answer is yes. There are many editing apps designed for this purpose. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one such editing app to slow down the pre-recorded videos.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-5"><a href="#Step-1-5" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Access your Adobe Premiere Pro application and import a video in the timeline. Identify the frame rate of your video clip for a non-choppy playback.</p>

<h2 id="Way-1-Use-Keyboard-Shortcuts"><a href="#Way-1-Use-Keyboard-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="Way 1: Use Keyboard Shortcuts"></a>Way 1: Use Keyboard Shortcuts</h2><p>When using an app, holding down Command key while using the plus (+) or minus (-) keys will allow you to zoom in or out as needed. Using the keyboard on your Mac, you may zoom in and out at intervals of 10%; when you do, a pop-up menu with the option to reset (i.e., return to the default, or 100%, zoom level) will display at the top of the screen. Instead of touching or repeating the shortcut, just keep holding the plus or minus key to zoom farther. Accessibility Zoom, which was created as a tool for the blind and enables you to zoom in on a Mac to see tiny text and precisely change settings with checkboxes, must be enabled if you wish to zoom in on the whole screen rather than just an app window (such as Utilities).</p>

Check the check next to “Use keyboard shortcuts to zoom” after that. Click the command key (located on either side of the space bar).</p>
<p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/open-zoom-from-accessibility.jpg" alt="how to zoom in/out on mac"></p>
<p>Step2Press the plus&#x2F;equal sign (“+ &#x3D;”) button, which is adjacent to the delete button on the top right side of the keyboard, while continuing to hold down the command button to zoom in.</p>
<p>Step3Press the dash&#x2F;underscore button (“- _“), which is situated next to the “+ &#x3D;” button on the top right side of the keyboard, while still holding down the command button, to zoom out.</p>
<h2 id="Way-2-Use-Trackpad-Gestures"><a href="#Way-2-Use-Trackpad-Gestures" class="headerlink" title="Way 2: Use Trackpad Gestures"></a>Way 2: Use Trackpad Gestures</h2><p>You may quickly learn how to zoom in on a Mac using trackpad movements if you prefer using a touchpad versus learning any kind of keyboard shortcuts. With a MacBook, there is another, maybe simpler way to zoom in and out in addition to the approach mentioned above. If your keyboard isn’t entirely working, it may still be helpful. However, make sure that gesture support is turned on in the settings on your Mac. Although a Mac still supports the usage of a mouse, new Mac software is designed to be used with a trackpad. Apple is abandoning the mouse. And with a little practice, you can do it too. What you must do is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="Steps-to-Enable-Trackpad-Gestures"><a href="#Steps-to-Enable-Trackpad-Gestures" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Enable Trackpad Gestures"></a>Steps to Enable Trackpad Gestures</h3><p>Step1Open System Preferences and choose Trackpad. Next, choose the Scroll &amp; Zoom tab and select the “Smart zoom” checkbox. Zooming in on web sites, photos, and documents couldn’t be much simpler after gesture support was set up:</p>
<p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/trackpad-scroll-zoom.jpg" alt="how to zoom in/out on mac"></p>
<p>Step2You can zoom in or out on Mac by placing two fingers on the touchpad and moving one finger closer to the other or further apart (repeat for additional zooming)</p>
<p>Step3Another option is to simply zoom in and out by double-tapping the touchpad with two fingers.</p>
<h2 id="Way-3-Use-Scroll-Gesture"><a href="#Way-3-Use-Scroll-Gesture" class="headerlink" title="Way 3: Use Scroll Gesture"></a>Way 3: Use Scroll Gesture</h2><p>If you’d like to use your mouse, you may utilize the screen zoom option, which enlarges everything on your screen rather than just the app window you’re now viewing. This would need holding down one of the designated modifier keys while scrolling in order to zoom in on a Mac. Just like on an iPhone or iPad, you can zoom in and out by pinching and un-pinching. The smart zoom motion, on the other hand, is executed by double-tapping with two fingers. This immediately zooms into or immediately zooms out of a web page or pdf.</p>

One of your alternatives is to enable zooming while hovering over text. The “Enable Hover Text” option is part of the Zoom menu but does not directly magnify the display. The function allows users to use the Command key to momentarily enlarge just the text below the pointer and is accessible without Zoom having to be activated. When Hover Text is enabled on your Mac, you may drag the cursor over anything on the screen, such as text, input fields, menu items, or buttons, and a high-resolution magnified version of those objects will appear in a new window.

<p><strong>User’s Guide to Create a Slideshow in the Photos App of a Mac Device</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Launch the App</strong></p>

<p>About the selection of background music, you can either choose an audio track from the in-built music app of your iPad, or go with the inline complementary music of the presentation theme that you have already selected.</p>

<p>When you have finished reading the text, click on the ‘Stop’ button to end the transcription process. The ‘Save as Audio’ option gets enabled, allowing you to convert your text into speech in the MP3, OGG, WAV and FLAC file formats.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Customize Your Audio</strong></p>
<p>The Panopreter program lets you add suitable customizations to the transcribed audio to ensure affordable file size and sound quality. You can adjust the bit rate and sample rate to address the aforesaid concern. All you need to do is, head to the ‘Menu Options’ at the top of the app screen and select ‘Settings’.</p>
<p>Click on the ‘Audio Format’ option within the ‘Settings’ window pops up, followed by selecting a suitable format for the audio file. On most cases, the WAV format works best to address the output quality requirements in an affordable manner.</p>

<p>The transcription outputs rendered by a speech to text converter program use the comma to separate different elements and sections within the text, in the same way as you would normally do while writing a document with conventional methods.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What is the significance of a clean verbatim?</strong></p>
<p>A clean verbatim caters to a convenient readability of your audio-visual files through a slight customization process. This one is an accurately rendered transcription that keeps all the essential information within the recording, while eliminating the undesired, noisy background audio.</p>

<p>The requirement of internet connectivity is rather selective with respect to the specific converter program or application you are working with. While some of them may require you to remain online throughout the transcription process, other may work well in the offline mode of operation.</p>

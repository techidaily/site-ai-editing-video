Videos are like windows to the past, allowing us to relive precious moments and memories. Similarly, good-looking videos have this remarkable ability to last forever. Even when it comes to content creation, videos are a great engagement tool. They engage audiences like no other medium can, conveying emotions and messages.</p>
<p>However, <strong>VHS effects</strong> have added more spice to the content creation and the creative work behind it. They give a normal video a distinct character and style, further improving it. By applying <strong>VHS filters</strong>, you can change the mood of your videos entirely. Applying these effects to your videos sometimes becomes difficult. However, there is always a simple solution to apply VHS to your videos.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-VHS-Effect-An-Overview"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-VHS-Effect-An-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is VHS Effect? An Overview"></a>Part 1: What is VHS Effect? An Overview</h2><p>People from the 80s would remember the good old days when they used to watch movies on VHS tapes. In simple terms, the <strong>VHS effect</strong> is a style that tries to recreate the look of VHS recordings. It’s a nostalgic-style effect that has gained popularity in recent years. You can apply different filters and techniques to your videos to achieve this effect.</p>
<p>These techniques aim to replicate the features of VHS tapes. The key features of the VHS filters include distortion, noise, and tracking errors. Distortion and noise create flickering lines and static. Furthermore, the tracking errors give the impression of an unstable video signal. These elements make the video appear just like the old VHS tapes from the 80s.</p>
<p>Additionally, color grading plays an important role in creating this effect. VHS tapes had a unique color palette with saturated and slightly shifted colors. You can replicate this effect by adjusting and applying color grading effects.</p>

In the Netflix series Stranger Things, there is an opposite version of our world called the Upside Down. The Upside Down is dark, creepy, and possibly filled with aliens, monsters, creatures, and other things.</p>
<p>Now, you can also apply the Stranger Things Upside Down Effect to your video! This effect combines camera tricks and video editing within <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to transition from the normal world into the Upside Down.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Guide"><a href="#How-to-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How-to Guide"></a>How-to Guide</h2><p><em><strong>1) Preparation</strong></em></p>
<p>To make this effect, you will need two footage shots: one with the camera moving down and one with the camera coming back up.</p>
<p>When shooting for the footage, follow the steps below:</p>
<p><strong>First shot</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Find any item close enough to the ground that we can block our frame with.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="block our frame with item"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Once you have your talent lined up, rotate your camera while lowering it below the foreground item at a constant speed and leaving the camera there. The key is making sure when you go behind the object, the frame is nothing but black.</li>
</ol>

                      alt="rotate your camera"
                ></p>
<p>For the next scene, have your actor change positions, or you can change the set around to look like the Upside Down. For instance, adding fake plants and flickering lights.</p>
<p><strong>Second shot</strong></p>
<p>Start bringing your camera back up at the same speed and rotate it again in the direction it was moving.</p>

<p>Now, launch Filmora on your PC and follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Step1 Take your first clip in the “normal” world and drag it down to a video track on the timeline. Trim the edge of the clip, so it ends on pure black and in a downward motion.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="trim the edge of the clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Drag the second clip (in the Upside Down) onto the video track on the timeline after the first clip. Trim this video, so it begins in pure black and an upward motion.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-5.jpg"
                      alt="trim video"
                ></p>
<p>Cut the clips to get the timing right since it should be a very fast transition. You can cut in the black frames so they won’t be too apparent.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a perfectly smooth transition, you can add a dissolve by going to <strong>Transitions &gt; Basic &gt; Dissolve</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="cut the clips"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Color Grading and Effects</strong></p>
<p>After the transition, you can make the clip look a lot more like the Upside Down from the show with a color grade and Filmora effects. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Step1 Double-click on your second clip, then go to <strong>Color &gt; Advanced</strong>. For a quick edit, you can try one of the presets available, such as “cool film.” It will give you the colder blue tones that Stranger Things used for the Upside Down.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-7.jpg"
                      alt="go to color"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 You can further edit the color grading in the white balance menu. Drag the slider to the left to get a blue, cold vibe for the Upside Down.</p>
<p>The “cool” or “warm” color grading technically talks about color temperature. A “warmer” look will be more orange, and a “colder” look will be bluer. You can also use the tint slider to fine-tune the look.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="further edit the color grading"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Next, move down to the color, lower the brightness and increase contrast. It makes the scene darker and more sinister than the normal world.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="move down to the color"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Finally, go down to the vignette and drag the amount slider a tiny bit to give a Vinnette around your clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="go down to the vignette"
                ></p>
<p><em><strong>3) Pro Tips</strong></em></p>
<p>You can still make your clip look even more like Upside Down with some Filmora elements.</p>
<p>Go to <strong>Elements &gt; Smoke &gt; Smokescreen 2</strong>. Drag this element on top of your Upside Down clip and trim it, so it starts at the same time the clip leaves the black frame.</p>

                      alt="drag this element on top of your upside down clip"
                ></p>
<p>You can adjust the opacity by double-clicking the smoke effect to open the setting.</p>
<p>Finally, go to the <strong>Transition &gt; Basic &gt; Dissolve</strong> to the start of the smoke and adjust it when the smoke gradually appears.</p>

It is an obvious fact that given a choice to voice out or type, the former would bag in a considerably higher number of votes.</p>
<p>Having a technology backup, it is now practically possible to convert your voice commands into text with utmost ease, thanks to the advent of reliable speech to text applications. The utility works to transform the words you speak, into an exact text representation, thus saving both, your time and energy. Such applications work on the principle of responding to speech recognition requests and processing the same to render an equitable text output.</p>
<p>The required audio information is sent across a synchronous request to process the different sound pieces, one at a time. When all such pieces are processed and recognized, the text response is generated to the credit of the user. Talking of the device and platform compatibility of such applications, you can comfortably work on them in either of your system based, or mobile devices with an equal efficiency.</p>
<p>Browsing through the IT market, you may however land across exclusive as well as implicit choices to work on your preferred deices. While there are some smartphone specific speech-to-text applications, others may have a good compatibility with desktops and PCs. Moving ahead, there comes a third category of software ranges that is all set to work with smartphones as well as desktop systems.</p>

Entering deeper into the domain, there are fields like digital marketing and content planning that are reported of having a considerable dependency on such applications and utilities. Some of the pivotal reasons in support of the credibility are described as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Improving Work Efficiency</strong></p>
<p>Talking specifically in line with the professional organizations that are greatly centered on text based working modules, or follow an extraneous typing and writing work pattern, the speech to text conversion facility is no less than a fantastic rescue to the tiresome sessions of spending time on fidgeting with PC and laptop keyboards.</p>
<p>Not only do such applications work towards lightening up the system exposure burden, but also facilitate a quick workability that further caters to increase the efficiency and work performance of the organization’s workforce.

<h3 id="02User’s-Guide-for-Converting-Text-to-Speech-in-Panopreter-3"><a href="#02User’s-Guide-for-Converting-Text-to-Speech-in-Panopreter-3" class="headerlink" title="02User’s Guide for Converting Text to Speech in Panopreter"></a>02User’s Guide for Converting Text to Speech in Panopreter</h3><p><strong>Step 1: Download the Converter Program</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the official Panopreter website and download the software to your system. Once then download gets completed, proceed to install the same and wait for the program’s welcome screen to appear.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Mode Selection and Setting</strong></p>
<p>As the launch screen pops up, you will be asked to choose the preferred working mode from the ‘Input and Speak’ and ‘Read Batch Files’ alternatives. You should know that the former is the default operation mode of the software and you can activate the same in a few steps.</p>
<p>Start with navigating to the ‘Menu Options’ tab and clicking on the ‘Settings’ option in the latter’s drop down list. The ‘Settings’ dialog box pops up, where you need to hit the ‘Speak Node’ option in the panel at the left. In the ‘Speak Window’ that appears next, click within the checkbox of your desired option and that’s it! The default ‘Input and Speak’ mode will be activated when you re-launch the software.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you desire to work in the ‘Read Batch Files’ mode, navigate to the ‘Menu Bar’ at the top of the software interface and hit the ‘File’ tab. From the list of items that drops down, select the ‘Read Batch Files’ option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Mode Specific Software Operation</strong></p>
<p>If you are working in the ‘Input and Speak’ mode, you can proceed with typing or pasting a desired text within the ‘Text Window’ Another option is to open a desired text document or file directly from your system. As for working in the ‘Read Batch Files’ mode, you are allowed to manage your system’s text files through the ‘Open’, ‘Clear’ and ‘Delete’ buttons. You should however take caution to add all the files in a common language.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Language Selection</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Language List’ window and pick a preferred language to convert the text files into audio transcripts. Remember to choose the same conversion language as added of the ‘Text Window’ files in Step 2, lest you would end up getting an undesirable speech output.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Voice Selection</strong></p>
<p>As you complete Step 4, a series of preset text to speech voice alternatives present within your system for the preferred language will show up in the ‘Voice Window’. Proceed to select the voice type you like.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Read Aloud!</strong></p>
<p>After you have selected the voice, tap the ‘Speak’ button and start reading your text aloud. Amid the process, you will see the ‘Stop’, ‘Resume’ and ‘Pause’ buttons getting enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Save Your Transcription</strong></p>
<p>When you have finished reading the text, click on the ‘Stop’ button to end the transcription process. The ‘Save as Audio’ option gets enabled, allowing you to convert your text into speech in the MP3, OGG, WAV and FLAC file formats.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Customize Your Audio</strong></p>
<p>The Panopreter program lets you add suitable customizations to the transcribed audio to ensure affordable file size and sound quality. You can adjust the bit rate and sample rate to address the aforesaid concern. All you need to do is, head to the ‘Menu Options’ at the top of the app screen and select ‘Settings’.</p>
<p>Click on the ‘Audio Format’ option within the ‘Settings’ window pops up, followed by selecting a suitable format for the audio file. On most cases, the WAV format works best to address the output quality requirements in an affordable manner.</p>

In the launch screen, navigate to and tap any one of the ‘Add Photo’ or ‘Add Folder’ buttons at the top left corner to import either a single media file, or an entire media folder to the program’s editing workspace.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-GIF-File"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-GIF-File" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is a GIF File?"></a>Part 1 What Is a GIF File?</h2><p><strong>GIF</strong> is an acronym for Graphics Interchange Format. Talking of the explicit <strong>GIF meaning</strong>, this one is a short motion snippet created from a set of serially arranged still images in a looping motion. Talking of the origin of GIFs, these were first introduced in 1987 by Steve Wilhite from the US based online service provider CompuServe, precisely on June 15.</p>
<p><strong>GIFs</strong> serve as portable image formats for still and animated images, and are primarily small sized files. However, these are very well compatible with large content files too. In today’s times, GIFs are a trending means of entertainment based content sharing and intensified message delivery to target audience. Additionally, you can conveniently use motion images in the <strong>GIF format</strong> as effective tools of improvising and upgrading your marketing straggles for an enhanced brand promotion.</p>
<p>Considering the immense content varieties of GIFs, these are an eminent part of blogs, social media posts and product websites. You can even use them to objectify your emotions and feelings when conversing with peers through the latest instant messaging applications. The bottom line is, GIFs are an integral part of today’s modern and dynamic communication patterns and needs.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Are-GIF-File-Subject-to-Copyright"><a href="#Part-2-Are-GIF-File-Subject-to-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Are GIF File Subject to Copyright?"></a>Part 2 Are GIF File Subject to Copyright?</h2><p>The straight and simple answer to this query is a ‘Yes’. CIFs are indeed subject to copyright, just like its creative counterparts. These essentially constitute an original copyrighted creation, or may even originate from an existing copyright protected work. However, you may encounter potential glitches when choosing to work with <strong>GIF images</strong> while sticking with legal constraints.</p>
<p>Talking of the potential issues with the legality of GIF usage, there are two major concerns; the first being the sharing of unlicensed copyrighted GIF content, while the absence of legalized methods for licensed commercial use of these short motion clips being the second. Talking of possible reasons, there is again a duel. At present, there no copyright exercise from the end of original creators of GIF content, along with the absence of exact copyright claim constraints that can be imposed by content owners.</p>
<p>This scenario poses a potential need to look for suitable mitigation methods to curb copyright claims and disputes resulting from illegal use of GIFs. As a matter of fact, the development of a proper legal framework for undisputed GIF usage is a time consuming process. However, you can stay cautious by adhering to the following measures in the meantime:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Refrain from using GIFs in a manner that would appear unsolicited to you, had you been the content owner.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Take a note to credit the original creators in case3 you are using the GIF content from a known copyright source.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Avoid drawing content from doubtful sources, instead search for trusted alternatives, or creating a GIF of your own would be an even better and safe choice.</p>

You can ensure an effective reach and impact of your brand if you include these catchy, short animation loops in your promotion strategy.

<p>Stay tuned to get an insight into what and how of GIFs with utmost ease! Here’s all about the origin, credibility, creation and content repositories of GIFs!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-GIF-File-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-GIF-File-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is a GIF File?"></a>Part 1 What Is a GIF File?</h2><p><strong>GIF</strong> is an acronym for Graphics Interchange Format. Talking of the explicit <strong>GIF meaning</strong>, this one is a short motion snippet created from a set of serially arranged still images in a looping motion. Talking of the origin of GIFs, these were first introduced in 1987 by Steve Wilhite from the US based online service provider CompuServe, precisely on June 15.</p>
<p><strong>GIFs</strong> serve as portable image formats for still and animated images, and are primarily small sized files. However, these are very well compatible with large content files too. In today’s times, GIFs are a trending means of entertainment based content sharing and intensified message delivery to target audience. Additionally, you can conveniently use motion images in the <strong>GIF format</strong> as effective tools of improvising and upgrading your marketing straggles for an enhanced brand promotion.</p>
<p>Considering the immense content varieties of GIFs, these are an eminent part of blogs, social media posts and product websites. You can even use them to objectify your emotions and feelings when conversing with peers through the latest instant messaging applications. The bottom line is, GIFs are an integral part of today’s modern and dynamic communication patterns and needs.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Are-GIF-File-Subject-to-Copyright-1"><a href="#Part-2-Are-GIF-File-Subject-to-Copyright-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Are GIF File Subject to Copyright?"></a>Part 2 Are GIF File Subject to Copyright?</h2><p>The straight and simple answer to this query is a ‘Yes’. CIFs are indeed subject to copyright, just like its creative counterparts. These essentially constitute an original copyrighted creation, or may even originate from an existing copyright protected work. However, you may encounter potential glitches when choosing to work with <strong>GIF images</strong> while sticking with legal constraints.</p>
<p>Talking of the potential issues with the legality of GIF usage, there are two major concerns; the first being the sharing of unlicensed copyrighted GIF content, while the absence of legalized methods for licensed commercial use of these short motion clips being the second. Talking of possible reasons, there is again a duel. At present, there no copyright exercise from the end of original creators of GIF content, along with the absence of exact copyright claim constraints that can be imposed by content owners.</p>
<p>This scenario poses a potential need to look for suitable mitigation methods to curb copyright claims and disputes resulting from illegal use of GIFs. As a matter of fact, the development of a proper legal framework for undisputed GIF usage is a time consuming process. However, you can stay cautious by adhering to the following measures in the meantime:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Refrain from using GIFs in a manner that would appear unsolicited to you, had you been the content owner.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Take a note to credit the original creators in case3 you are using the GIF content from a known copyright source.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Avoid drawing content from doubtful sources, instead search for trusted alternatives, or creating a GIF of your own would be an even better and safe choice.</p>

You can ensure an effective reach and impact of your brand if you include these catchy, short animation loops in your promotion strategy.

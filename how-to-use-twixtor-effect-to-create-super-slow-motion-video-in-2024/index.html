But what Twixtor is and why it is utilized are the topics we will cover in this article.</p>
<p>In addition, we will learn how to manipulate its characteristics to get the best possible outcome for our working composition in the Premiere Pro and After Effects plug-ins. Without any further ado, let’s get straight to the business!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Twixtor-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Twixtor-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Twixtor and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1: What is Twixtor and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Twixtor is a plug-in developed by RevisionFX. It is available for purchase. The plug-in gives users the ability to speed up, slow down, or convert the frame rate of picture sequences, all with special effects. Twixtor can visually estimate what a video is meant to look like in a slow-motion setting using video analysis and interoperability.</p>
<p>Due to the need for unparalleled image quality, RE: Vision Effects developed unique tracking technology that determines every individual pixel’s motion. This technology allows Twixtor to synthesize new innovative frames by warping and interpolating frames from the original sequence, resulting in unprecedented image quality.</p>
<p>Reset the clock to a single-speed setting. Always remember that you can customize the retiming on a frame-by-frame basis!</p>
<p>When items are crossing in the scene, Twixtor is more accurate and shows fewer artifacts than other rendering engines. This reduces the ripping and stretching of items when they cross the frame or exit it completely.</p>
<p>But how does Twixtor work is the million-dollar question! While Premiere includes the ability to slow down your film and has a newer, better-quality version dubbed Optical Flow, it cannot zoom in on your footage (called Pixel Motion in After Effects).</p>
<p>The slow-motion quality is undoubtedly superior to that of simple frame blending, but it is not the finest grade slow motion available. The TWIXTOR from Re: Vision Effects has long been the go-to solution for the most excellent post-slow motion. It is pricey, but it is well worth it.</p>
<p>The Pro edition provides you with the opportunity to fine-tune the pitch of the auto track, as well as the option to employ mattes and alphas to enrich your tracks and the ability to deal with motion vectors from a 3D system, among other features.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Twixtor-to-Create-Super-Slow-Mo-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Twixtor-to-Create-Super-Slow-Mo-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Twixtor to Create Super Slow-Mo in Adobe Premiere Pro?"></a>Part 2: How to Use Twixtor to Create Super Slow-Mo in Adobe Premiere Pro?</h2><p>As we’ve already mentioned, we will be analyzing how Twixtor makes slow mos; we will be starting with the Adobe Premiere Pro. The following are the steps you need to learn to perform it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: After importing the video to the timeline, do some basic editing such as trimming and removing audio from the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nest-sequence-premiere-pro.jpg"
                      alt="nest sequence premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Nest the sequence to convert the video into a new sequence automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to the Effects tab and search for Twixtor, and then drop the Twixtor Pro to the video clip in the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twixtor-pro-effect-premiere-pro.jpg"
                      alt="twixtor pro effect premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Right-click the video in the timeline again and scroll down to <strong>Show Clip Keyframes</strong> to enable the <strong>Speed</strong> option under <strong>Time Remapping</strong>. You can now enable the GPU acceleration to fast rendering.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click the Keyframe icon to mark the points where you want to begin with the slow-motion effect, and then mark the end part of the slow-motion effect video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-keyframes-to-slow-motion-premiere-pro.jpg"
                      alt="add keyframes to slow motion premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7: Now, drag the line lower to add a slo-mo effect to video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-line-to-slow-motion-twixtor-premiere-pro.jpg"
                      alt="drag line to slow motion twixtor premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p>Remember that your video can sometimes lag if you set the video speed at a meager percentage. To avoid that, utilize settings in a better way to ensure your video works flawlessly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-Super-Slow-Motion-in-After-Effects-with-Twixtor"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-Super-Slow-Motion-in-After-Effects-with-Twixtor" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Create Super Slow Motion in After Effects with Twixtor?"></a>Part 3: How to Create Super Slow Motion in After Effects with Twixtor?</h2><p>When working with After Effects software, Twixtor is a convenient plug-in since it allows us to create slow-motion effects from any video source.</p>
<p>We’ll look at an example to better comprehend what we’re talking about in this post. Before we begin our study of the Twixtor plug-in, let us get acquainted with the software’s operating screen to quickly understand the content of this article as we go through our assessment of the Twixtor plug-in.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you launch <strong>After Effects</strong>, go to <strong>File&gt;Import&gt;File</strong> to import your footage. Here you can see the actual frame rate of your film. You may drag your film onto the timeline by right-clicking it and selecting <strong>New Comp from Selection</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select your video from the timeline in the composition, then go to Effects &amp; Presets pane to search Twixtor, and you will find Twixtor or Twixtor Pro under RE: Vision plug-ins, depending on your version. Drag and drop it to the video in the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-twixtor-slow-motion-plugin.jpg"
                      alt="after effects twixtor slow motion plugin"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: In the Twixtor effect controls, enter the frame rate of the film you found previously. The faster and better your slowed footage will become, the higher the frame rate.</p>
<p>For organizational reasons, After Effects employs the “<strong>tree-ing</strong>“ concept, sometimes known as drop-down menus. Click on the yellow number next to Input: Frame Rate under <strong>Source Control</strong>. It should be set to 29.97 by default. Please set it to the frame rate you discovered previously in the tutorial.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-after-effects-twixtor-pro-settings.jpg"
                      alt="adjust after effects twixtor pro settings"
                ></p>
<p>You can then adjust the speed and time remap mode accordingly. For more information, you can watch the video tutorial below to find out how to create smooth Twixtor effects in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Get-the-Twixtor-Style-Effect-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Get-the-Twixtor-Style-Effect-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Get the Twixtor Style Effect on iPhone?"></a>Part 4: How to Get the Twixtor Style Effect on iPhone?</h2><p>It is possible to shoot videos in slow motion and then play them back at average speed using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slopro/id507232505" >SloPro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – 1000fps Slow Motion Video from Sand Mountain Studios, a fantastic video editing effects tool.</p>
<p>Inserting slow motion cues and changing playback speeds without waiting is possible with renderless editing. It allows you to produce slow-motion films and enables you to insert extremely rapid sequences and cycle between various speeds.</p>
<p>SloPro even enables you to edit your films as they are being recorded, allowing you to choose between slow and fast motion while recording.</p>
<p>This program provides complete support for sharing through social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, allowing you to show off your impressive video creations to the rest of the world. It has already been established that SloPro is one of the few videos editing software that includes optical flow as a stand-alone effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slopro-slow-motion-app-iphone.jpg"
                      alt="slopro slow motion app iphone"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: After you’ve imported your video, click on the <strong>red Edit</strong> button in the top-right corner of the screen to bring up the editing window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Trim the video down to the section that you wish to modify if required using the <strong>Clip In</strong> and <strong>Clip Out</strong> functions. It is divided into clips using the speed in and speeds out controls.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Tap on the top-left box to bring up a list of fast and <strong>slow speed</strong> choices. <strong>Drag the cursor</strong> over the clip to bring up a fast and slow speed options list.</p>
<p>Step 4: If you want to use a slow speed, press the box in the upper right corner and choose <strong>Optical Flow</strong> from the menu.</p>
<p>This will render the clip with optical flow, resulting in the smooth Twixtor effect you are familiar with. There will be a watermark on your video if you use the program’s free version, but you can easily crop it out.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Slow-Mo videos are undoubtedly watch-worthy. They allow us to observe the fine details and appreciate the video content. But creating one isn’t child’s play. So, we decided to compile this article to inform our worthy readers on how they can get started using Twixtor on Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects. We hope you had a fun time learning!</p>

The following are the steps you need to learn to perform it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: After importing the video to the timeline, do some basic editing such as trimming and removing audio from the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="nest sequence premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Nest the sequence to convert the video into a new sequence automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to the Effects tab and search for Twixtor, and then drop the Twixtor Pro to the video clip in the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="twixtor pro effect premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Right-click the video in the timeline again and scroll down to <strong>Show Clip Keyframes</strong> to enable the <strong>Speed</strong> option under <strong>Time Remapping</strong>. You can now enable the GPU acceleration to fast rendering.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click the Keyframe icon to mark the points where you want to begin with the slow-motion effect, and then mark the end part of the slow-motion effect video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add keyframes to slow motion premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7: Now, drag the line lower to add a slo-mo effect to video.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Remember that your video can sometimes lag if you set the video speed at a meager percentage. To avoid that, utilize settings in a better way to ensure your video works flawlessly.</p>

<p>We’ll look at an example to better comprehend what we’re talking about in this post. Before we begin our study of the Twixtor plug-in, let us get acquainted with the software’s operating screen to quickly understand the content of this article as we go through our assessment of the Twixtor plug-in.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you launch <strong>After Effects</strong>, go to <strong>File&gt;Import&gt;File</strong> to import your footage. Here you can see the actual frame rate of your film. You may drag your film onto the timeline by right-clicking it and selecting <strong>New Comp from Selection</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select your video from the timeline in the composition, then go to Effects &amp; Presets pane to search Twixtor, and you will find Twixtor or Twixtor Pro under RE: Vision plug-ins, depending on your version. Drag and drop it to the video in the timeline.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: In the Twixtor effect controls, enter the frame rate of the film you found previously. The faster and better your slowed footage will become, the higher the frame rate.</p>
<p>For organizational reasons, After Effects employs the “<strong>tree-ing</strong>“ concept, sometimes known as drop-down menus. Click on the yellow number next to Input: Frame Rate under <strong>Source Control</strong>. It should be set to 29.97 by default. Please set it to the frame rate you discovered previously in the tutorial.</p>

<p>Inserting slow motion cues and changing playback speeds without waiting is possible with renderless editing. It allows you to produce slow-motion films and enables you to insert extremely rapid sequences and cycle between various speeds.</p>
<p>SloPro even enables you to edit your films as they are being recorded, allowing you to choose between slow and fast motion while recording.</p>
<p>This program provides complete support for sharing through social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, allowing you to show off your impressive video creations to the rest of the world. It has already been established that SloPro is one of the few videos editing software that includes optical flow as a stand-alone effect.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: After you’ve imported your video, click on the <strong>red Edit</strong> button in the top-right corner of the screen to bring up the editing window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Trim the video down to the section that you wish to modify if required using the <strong>Clip In</strong> and <strong>Clip Out</strong> functions. It is divided into clips using the speed in and speeds out controls.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Tap on the top-left box to bring up a list of fast and <strong>slow speed</strong> choices. <strong>Drag the cursor</strong> over the clip to bring up a fast and slow speed options list.</p>
<p>Step 4: If you want to use a slow speed, press the box in the upper right corner and choose <strong>Optical Flow</strong> from the menu.</p>
<p>This will render the clip with optical flow, resulting in the smooth Twixtor effect you are familiar with. There will be a watermark on your video if you use the program’s free version, but you can easily crop it out.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Slow-Mo videos are undoubtedly watch-worthy. They allow us to observe the fine details and appreciate the video content. But creating one isn’t child’s play.

It is available for purchase. The plug-in gives users the ability to speed up, slow down, or convert the frame rate of picture sequences, all with special effects. Twixtor can visually estimate what a video is meant to look like in a slow-motion setting using video analysis and interoperability.</p>
<p>Due to the need for unparalleled image quality, RE: Vision Effects developed unique tracking technology that determines every individual pixel’s motion. This technology allows Twixtor to synthesize new innovative frames by warping and interpolating frames from the original sequence, resulting in unprecedented image quality.</p>
<p>Reset the clock to a single-speed setting. Always remember that you can customize the retiming on a frame-by-frame basis!</p>
<p>When items are crossing in the scene, Twixtor is more accurate and shows fewer artifacts than other rendering engines. This reduces the ripping and stretching of items when they cross the frame or exit it completely.</p>
<p>But how does Twixtor work is the million-dollar question! While Premiere includes the ability to slow down your film and has a newer, better-quality version dubbed Optical Flow, it cannot zoom in on your footage (called Pixel Motion in After Effects).</p>

<p>We’ll look at an example to better comprehend what we’re talking about in this post. Before we begin our study of the Twixtor plug-in, let us get acquainted with the software’s operating screen to quickly understand the content of this article as we go through our assessment of the Twixtor plug-in.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you launch <strong>After Effects</strong>, go to <strong>File&gt;Import&gt;File</strong> to import your footage. Here you can see the actual frame rate of your film. You may drag your film onto the timeline by right-clicking it and selecting <strong>New Comp from Selection</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select your video from the timeline in the composition, then go to Effects &amp; Presets pane to search Twixtor, and you will find Twixtor or Twixtor Pro under RE: Vision plug-ins, depending on your version. Drag and drop it to the video in the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-twixtor-slow-motion-plugin.jpg"
                      alt="after effects twixtor slow motion plugin"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: In the Twixtor effect controls, enter the frame rate of the film you found previously. The faster and better your slowed footage will become, the higher the frame rate.</p>
<p>For organizational reasons, After Effects employs the “<strong>tree-ing</strong>“ concept, sometimes known as drop-down menus. Click on the yellow number next to Input: Frame Rate under <strong>Source Control</strong>. It should be set to 29.97 by default. Please set it to the frame rate you discovered previously in the tutorial.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>You can then adjust the speed and time remap mode accordingly. For more information, you can watch the video tutorial below to find out how to create smooth Twixtor effects in Adobe After Effects.</p>

<p>Inserting slow motion cues and changing playback speeds without waiting is possible with renderless editing. It allows you to produce slow-motion films and enables you to insert extremely rapid sequences and cycle between various speeds.</p>
<p>SloPro even enables you to edit your films as they are being recorded, allowing you to choose between slow and fast motion while recording.</p>
<p>This program provides complete support for sharing through social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, allowing you to show off your impressive video creations to the rest of the world. It has already been established that SloPro is one of the few videos editing software that includes optical flow as a stand-alone effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="slopro slow motion app iphone"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: After you’ve imported your video, click on the <strong>red Edit</strong> button in the top-right corner of the screen to bring up the editing window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Trim the video down to the section that you wish to modify if required using the <strong>Clip In</strong> and <strong>Clip Out</strong> functions. It is divided into clips using the speed in and speeds out controls.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Tap on the top-left box to bring up a list of fast and <strong>slow speed</strong> choices. <strong>Drag the cursor</strong> over the clip to bring up a fast and slow speed options list.</p>
<p>Step 4: If you want to use a slow speed, press the box in the upper right corner and choose <strong>Optical Flow</strong> from the menu.</p>
<p>This will render the clip with optical flow, resulting in the smooth Twixtor effect you are familiar with. There will be a watermark on your video if you use the program’s free version, but you can easily crop it out.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Slow-Mo videos are undoubtedly watch-worthy. They allow us to observe the fine details and appreciate the video content. But creating one isn’t child’s play. So, we decided to compile this article to inform our worthy readers on how they can get started using Twixtor on Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects. We hope you had a fun time learning!</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Tips-for-a-Great-Slideshow-Video"><a href="#Part-2-Tips-for-a-Great-Slideshow-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Tips for a Great Slideshow Video"></a>Part 2 Tips for a Great Slideshow Video</h2><p>Videos are gaining much popularity these days. It is an easy way to connect with people and show emotions to them. In the same way, slideshow videos also are important in their place. Slides are the collection of traditional photos or negatives which are out of trend now. And slideshow videos are the perfect way to use those slides and relieve those faded memories with loved ones. Creating the slideshow video is also easy and can be done easily with the help of some tools. You don’t need to be professional, but the only need is to follow certain tips carefully. Here, we are sharing the essential tips to prepare a great slideshow video. Also, you will get to know about the best tool for video creation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Tell a story</strong></p>
<p>Prepare the slideshow video in the form of storytelling. Whatever is the theme of your slideshow, prepare the script of the video right from the start. Make a meaningful and impressive story. Select and collect the raw materials according to the requirement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep it cohesive</strong></p>
<p>The cohesion of photos or images is very important in a video slideshow. It is advised not to mix and match still photos and videos in 1 slideshow. Also, choose the photos belonging to the same color family. Mixing different varieties of photos divert the attention of the viewer. Also, one warm photo, then one cool and so on are not the efficient choices for a slideshow. All the images should appear as part of one color family and are similar to one another. Always maintain the quality of photos throughout the slideshow. Gradual jumps between grainy portrait mode photos and some screenshots, meanwhile photos of other modes lead to distracting the viewer and blurring their experience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make it personal</strong></p>
<p>Video slideshows are a powerful tool to show your personality and your personal message. The videos should contain your feelings. So, customize them and make them as personal as you can. Give your uniqueness to your slideshows. For this, you can customize the color palette, text, etc and make them unique and personal. So that the people with whom you share the videos may also feel your touch.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep slideshow videos short</strong></p>
<p>There might be different aims for creating a slideshow video. You might want to share it with loved ones or any of your friends’ circle. Or you might be wanting it to post as an ad on social media platforms such as Instagram, or Facebook. Whatever the purpose of your making the video, keep them concise and short. Short video clips are best for grabbing the attention of the viewers. Everyone does not find it interesting to watch long-form videos. If you are aiming to make a longer-form video slideshow which contains both images and video clips, then keep each photo for 3 to 5 seconds and each video clip a maximum of 20 seconds. It is recommended to maintain the user’s interest throughout.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create a storyboard to plan your slideshow video</strong></p>
<p>As we have already discussed in the above point, the video should depict your story. Also, it should be in sync to make it more compelling. Creating a storyboard or outline is the perfect way to predict the right flow as well as choose the right elements for the video.</p>
<p>The storyboard helps to prepare a plan and develop the logical sequence of the photos. Also, if you want to add photos, video clips, texts, etc in a single slideshow, the storyboard can help to outline the sequence. With this, you will be able to create a video that will be logically correct.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add text to videos and images to convey your message clearly</strong></p>
<p>Text or captions are very crucial to be added to the slideshow especially if you are preparing them for social media. People these days do watch the videos by keeping the sound off on social media. So, they will not be able to get your message without captions. Keep all your key messages highlighted in the video. The first few seconds of the video play an important role. It is the deciding factor whether the viewer will watch the whole video or will just bounce back. So, give a captivating hook to the slideshow to capture the viewer’s attention and make them hit the unmute button.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Tips-for-a-Great-Slideshow-Video-1"><a href="#Part-2-Tips-for-a-Great-Slideshow-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Tips for a Great Slideshow Video"></a>Part 2 Tips for a Great Slideshow Video</h2><p>Videos are gaining much popularity these days. It is an easy way to connect with people and show emotions to them. In the same way, slideshow videos also are important in their place. Slides are the collection of traditional photos or negatives which are out of trend now. And slideshow videos are the perfect way to use those slides and relieve those faded memories with loved ones. Creating the slideshow video is also easy and can be done easily with the help of some tools. You don’t need to be professional, but the only need is to follow certain tips carefully. Here, we are sharing the essential tips to prepare a great slideshow video. Also, you will get to know about the best tool for video creation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Tell a story</strong></p>
<p>Prepare the slideshow video in the form of storytelling. Whatever is the theme of your slideshow, prepare the script of the video right from the start. Make a meaningful and impressive story. Select and collect the raw materials according to the requirement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep it cohesive</strong></p>
<p>The cohesion of photos or images is very important in a video slideshow. It is advised not to mix and match still photos and videos in 1 slideshow. Also, choose the photos belonging to the same color family. Mixing different varieties of photos divert the attention of the viewer. Also, one warm photo, then one cool and so on are not the efficient choices for a slideshow. All the images should appear as part of one color family and are similar to one another. Always maintain the quality of photos throughout the slideshow. Gradual jumps between grainy portrait mode photos and some screenshots, meanwhile photos of other modes lead to distracting the viewer and blurring their experience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make it personal</strong></p>
<p>Video slideshows are a powerful tool to show your personality and your personal message. The videos should contain your feelings. So, customize them and make them as personal as you can. Give your uniqueness to your slideshows. For this, you can customize the color palette, text, etc and make them unique and personal. So that the people with whom you share the videos may also feel your touch.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep slideshow videos short</strong></p>
<p>There might be different aims for creating a slideshow video. You might want to share it with loved ones or any of your friends’ circle. Or you might be wanting it to post as an ad on social media platforms such as Instagram, or Facebook. Whatever the purpose of your making the video, keep them concise and short. Short video clips are best for grabbing the attention of the viewers. Everyone does not find it interesting to watch long-form videos. If you are aiming to make a longer-form video slideshow which contains both images and video clips, then keep each photo for 3 to 5 seconds and each video clip a maximum of 20 seconds. It is recommended to maintain the user’s interest throughout.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create a storyboard to plan your slideshow video</strong></p>
<p>As we have already discussed in the above point, the video should depict your story. Also, it should be in sync to make it more compelling. Creating a storyboard or outline is the perfect way to predict the right flow as well as choose the right elements for the video.</p>
<p>The storyboard helps to prepare a plan and develop the logical sequence of the photos. Also, if you want to add photos, video clips, texts, etc in a single slideshow, the storyboard can help to outline the sequence. With this, you will be able to create a video that will be logically correct.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add text to videos and images to convey your message clearly</strong></p>
<p>Text or captions are very crucial to be added to the slideshow especially if you are preparing them for social media. People these days do watch the videos by keeping the sound off on social media. So, they will not be able to get your message without captions. Keep all your key messages highlighted in the video. The first few seconds of the video play an important role. It is the deciding factor whether the viewer will watch the whole video or will just bounce back. So, give a captivating hook to the slideshow to capture the viewer’s attention and make them hit the unmute button.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Tips-for-a-Great-Slideshow-Video-3"><a href="#Part-2-Tips-for-a-Great-Slideshow-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Tips for a Great Slideshow Video"></a>Part 2 Tips for a Great Slideshow Video</h2><p>Videos are gaining much popularity these days. It is an easy way to connect with people and show emotions to them. In the same way, slideshow videos also are important in their place. Slides are the collection of traditional photos or negatives which are out of trend now. And slideshow videos are the perfect way to use those slides and relieve those faded memories with loved ones. Creating the slideshow video is also easy and can be done easily with the help of some tools. You don’t need to be professional, but the only need is to follow certain tips carefully. Here, we are sharing the essential tips to prepare a great slideshow video. Also, you will get to know about the best tool for video creation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Tell a story</strong></p>
<p>Prepare the slideshow video in the form of storytelling. Whatever is the theme of your slideshow, prepare the script of the video right from the start. Make a meaningful and impressive story. Select and collect the raw materials according to the requirement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep it cohesive</strong></p>
<p>The cohesion of photos or images is very important in a video slideshow. It is advised not to mix and match still photos and videos in 1 slideshow. Also, choose the photos belonging to the same color family. Mixing different varieties of photos divert the attention of the viewer. Also, one warm photo, then one cool and so on are not the efficient choices for a slideshow. All the images should appear as part of one color family and are similar to one another. Always maintain the quality of photos throughout the slideshow. Gradual jumps between grainy portrait mode photos and some screenshots, meanwhile photos of other modes lead to distracting the viewer and blurring their experience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make it personal</strong></p>
<p>Video slideshows are a powerful tool to show your personality and your personal message. The videos should contain your feelings. So, customize them and make them as personal as you can. Give your uniqueness to your slideshows. For this, you can customize the color palette, text, etc and make them unique and personal. So that the people with whom you share the videos may also feel your touch.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep slideshow videos short</strong></p>
<p>There might be different aims for creating a slideshow video. You might want to share it with loved ones or any of your friends’ circle. Or you might be wanting it to post as an ad on social media platforms such as Instagram, or Facebook. Whatever the purpose of your making the video, keep them concise and short. Short video clips are best for grabbing the attention of the viewers. Everyone does not find it interesting to watch long-form videos. If you are aiming to make a longer-form video slideshow which contains both images and video clips, then keep each photo for 3 to 5 seconds and each video clip a maximum of 20 seconds. It is recommended to maintain the user’s interest throughout.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create a storyboard to plan your slideshow video</strong></p>
<p>As we have already discussed in the above point, the video should depict your story. Also, it should be in sync to make it more compelling. Creating a storyboard or outline is the perfect way to predict the right flow as well as choose the right elements for the video.</p>
<p>The storyboard helps to prepare a plan and develop the logical sequence of the photos. Also, if you want to add photos, video clips, texts, etc in a single slideshow, the storyboard can help to outline the sequence. With this, you will be able to create a video that will be logically correct.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add text to videos and images to convey your message clearly</strong></p>
<p>Text or captions are very crucial to be added to the slideshow especially if you are preparing them for social media. People these days do watch the videos by keeping the sound off on social media. So, they will not be able to get your message without captions. Keep all your key messages highlighted in the video. The first few seconds of the video play an important role. It is the deciding factor whether the viewer will watch the whole video or will just bounce back. So, give a captivating hook to the slideshow to capture the viewer’s attention and make them hit the unmute button.</p>

<p>A slideshow view fills the entire computer screen, much like a real slide show. The presentation is exhibited in full-screen mode, as the audience will see it. Graphics, timings, videos, animated elements, and transition effects get displayed in the same way they appear on stage. PowerPoint is an excellent tool for preparing presentations on the fly, whether for a seminar, classroom, lecture hall, conference, or even a contract pitch. With PowerPoint software, you can never go wrong. We’ll show you <strong>how to do a slideshow presentation</strong> in this post, even if you’re a complete novice who has never used it before.</p>

<p>Ready to make aslideshow? Let us get you started.</p>
<p>Step 1: Create New Presentation</p>
<p>To do so:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Go to your browser and click on the PowerPoint icon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When PowerPoint opens, go to the upper left-hand corner and choose “File,” then “New,” listed under “File.”</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Choose “New Presentation” from the drop-down menu, which will create a new slide show for you to begin uploading photos to.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-add-slideshow-in-powerpoint-6.jpg"
                      alt="Create New Presentation "
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Save PowerPoint</p>
<p>Go to the top right-hand side of the presentation screen and click on the flash drive icon. After that, you’ll be able to name your presentation and pick where to save it.</p>
<p>Remember to save your presentation after something that will remind you of the images in the File. This act will make it easier for you to find them later.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-add-slideshow-in-powerpoint-7.jpg"
                      alt="Save PowerPoint "
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Name the Page</p>
<p>Consider a title and type it in the box. Your title page can include a name, date, or image.</p>
<p>Choose an image-friendly arrangement, such as a slide with a title box and an image box, a slide with only an image box, or even a blank slide.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-add-slideshow-in-powerpoint-8.jpg"
                      alt="Name the Page"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Add Slides</p>
<p>You can choose from a variety of slide layouts and visuals. You can select “New Slide” from either “Home” or “Insert.” You may also right-click any slide in the left-hand panel and select “New Slide.” [1]</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Add Slides"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: Import Images</p>
<p>You have the option add one or multiple pictures to each slide. It’s all up to you. Double-click inside the picture box (or select Insert &gt; Picture &gt; From File from the Insert menu) and click OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Images"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6: Rearrange the Photo</p>
<p>You will find it easier to decide the optimum order for the slides if you use the slide sorter.</p>
<p>Bear the bottom of the image pane, and look for the “Slide Sorter” button. Then, using your mouse, drag the slides to their preferred locations.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Rearrange photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7: Add Transitions</p>
<p>Transitions are essential for tying the presentation together and allowing it to flow smoothly from one image to the next. Go to the “Transitions” tab at the top of the bar and experiment with the various possibilities.</p>

                      alt="Add Transition"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: Add a Background.</p>
<p>If the white space around the edges of your photographs bothers you, right-click on any slide, choose “Format Background,” and then adjust the background fill. You may change the hue, direction, and transparency of a solid fill, a gradient fill, etc. To make your slides look more professional,</p>

                      alt="Add Background"
                ></p>
<p>Step 9: Save your PowerPoint</p>
<p>Before exiting, save your show once you’ve finished adding photos and graphics. If you named and saved your presentation at the start, all you have to do now is click the flash drive icon in the upper left corner.</p>

<p>Step 1: Create New Presentation</p>
<p>To do so:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Go to your browser and click on the PowerPoint icon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When PowerPoint opens, go to the upper left-hand corner and choose “File,” then “New,” listed under “File.”</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Choose “New Presentation” from the drop-down menu, which will create a new slide show for you to begin uploading photos to.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create New Presentation "
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Save PowerPoint</p>
<p>Go to the top right-hand side of the presentation screen and click on the flash drive icon. After that, you’ll be able to name your presentation and pick where to save it.</p>
<p>Remember to save your presentation after something that will remind you of the images in the File. This act will make it easier for you to find them later.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-add-slideshow-in-powerpoint-7.jpg"
                      alt="Save PowerPoint "
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Name the Page</p>
<p>Consider a title and type it in the box. Your title page can include a name, date, or image.</p>
<p>Choose an image-friendly arrangement, such as a slide with a title box and an image box, a slide with only an image box, or even a blank slide.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Name the Page"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Add Slides</p>
<p>You can choose from a variety of slide layouts and visuals. You can select “New Slide” from either “Home” or “Insert.” You may also right-click any slide in the left-hand panel and select “New Slide.” [1]</p>

                      alt="Add Slides"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: Import Images</p>
<p>You have the option add one or multiple pictures to each slide. It’s all up to you. Double-click inside the picture box (or select Insert &gt; Picture &gt; From File from the Insert menu) and click OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Images"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6: Rearrange the Photo</p>
<p>You will find it easier to decide the optimum order for the slides if you use the slide sorter.</p>
<p>Bear the bottom of the image pane, and look for the “Slide Sorter” button. Then, using your mouse, drag the slides to their preferred locations.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 7: Add Transitions</p>
<p>Transitions are essential for tying the presentation together and allowing it to flow smoothly from one image to the next. Go to the “Transitions” tab at the top of the bar and experiment with the various possibilities.</p>

                      alt="Add Transition"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: Add a Background.</p>
<p>If the white space around the edges of your photographs bothers you, right-click on any slide, choose “Format Background,” and then adjust the background fill. You may change the hue, direction, and transparency of a solid fill, a gradient fill, etc. To make your slides look more professional,</p>

                      alt="Add Background"
                ></p>
<p>Step 9: Save your PowerPoint</p>
<p>Before exiting, save your show once you’ve finished adding photos and graphics. If you named and saved your presentation at the start, all you have to do now is click the flash drive icon in the upper left corner.</p>

<p>Ready to make aslideshow? Let us get you started.</p>
<p>Step 1: Create New Presentation</p>
<p>To do so:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Go to your browser and click on the PowerPoint icon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When PowerPoint opens, go to the upper left-hand corner and choose “File,” then “New,” listed under “File.”</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Choose “New Presentation” from the drop-down menu, which will create a new slide show for you to begin uploading photos to.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-add-slideshow-in-powerpoint-6.jpg"
                      alt="Create New Presentation "
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Save PowerPoint</p>
<p>Go to the top right-hand side of the presentation screen and click on the flash drive icon. After that, you’ll be able to name your presentation and pick where to save it.</p>
<p>Remember to save your presentation after something that will remind you of the images in the File. This act will make it easier for you to find them later.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-add-slideshow-in-powerpoint-7.jpg"
                      alt="Save PowerPoint "
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Name the Page</p>
<p>Consider a title and type it in the box. Your title page can include a name, date, or image.</p>
<p>Choose an image-friendly arrangement, such as a slide with a title box and an image box, a slide with only an image box, or even a blank slide.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-add-slideshow-in-powerpoint-8.jpg"
                      alt="Name the Page"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Add Slides</p>
<p>You can choose from a variety of slide layouts and visuals. You can select “New Slide” from either “Home” or “Insert.” You may also right-click any slide in the left-hand panel and select “New Slide.” [1]</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-add-slideshow-in-powerpoint-9.jpg"
                      alt="Add Slides"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: Import Images</p>
<p>You have the option add one or multiple pictures to each slide. It’s all up to you. Double-click inside the picture box (or select Insert &gt; Picture &gt; From File from the Insert menu) and click OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Images"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6: Rearrange the Photo</p>
<p>You will find it easier to decide the optimum order for the slides if you use the slide sorter.</p>
<p>Bear the bottom of the image pane, and look for the “Slide Sorter” button. Then, using your mouse, drag the slides to their preferred locations.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Rearrange photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7: Add Transitions</p>
<p>Transitions are essential for tying the presentation together and allowing it to flow smoothly from one image to the next. Go to the “Transitions” tab at the top of the bar and experiment with the various possibilities.</p>

                      alt="Add Transition"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: Add a Background.</p>
<p>If the white space around the edges of your photographs bothers you, right-click on any slide, choose “Format Background,” and then adjust the background fill. You may change the hue, direction, and transparency of a solid fill, a gradient fill, etc. To make your slides look more professional,</p>

                      alt="Add Background"
                ></p>
<p>Step 9: Save your PowerPoint</p>
<p>Before exiting, save your show once you’ve finished adding photos and graphics. If you named and saved your presentation at the start, all you have to do now is click the flash drive icon in the upper left corner.</p>

                     lazyload

<p>Step 1: Create New Presentation</p>
<p>To do so:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Go to your browser and click on the PowerPoint icon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When PowerPoint opens, go to the upper left-hand corner and choose “File,” then “New,” listed under “File.”</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Choose “New Presentation” from the drop-down menu, which will create a new slide show for you to begin uploading photos to.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create New Presentation "
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Save PowerPoint</p>
<p>Go to the top right-hand side of the presentation screen and click on the flash drive icon. After that, you’ll be able to name your presentation and pick where to save it.</p>
<p>Remember to save your presentation after something that will remind you of the images in the File. This act will make it easier for you to find them later.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-add-slideshow-in-powerpoint-7.jpg"
                      alt="Save PowerPoint "
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Name the Page</p>
<p>Consider a title and type it in the box. Your title page can include a name, date, or image.</p>
<p>Choose an image-friendly arrangement, such as a slide with a title box and an image box, a slide with only an image box, or even a blank slide.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Name the Page"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Add Slides</p>
<p>You can choose from a variety of slide layouts and visuals. You can select “New Slide” from either “Home” or “Insert.” You may also right-click any slide in the left-hand panel and select “New Slide.” [1]</p>

                      alt="Add Slides"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: Import Images</p>
<p>You have the option add one or multiple pictures to each slide. It’s all up to you. Double-click inside the picture box (or select Insert &gt; Picture &gt; From File from the Insert menu) and click OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Import Images"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6: Rearrange the Photo</p>
<p>You will find it easier to decide the optimum order for the slides if you use the slide sorter.</p>
<p>Bear the bottom of the image pane, and look for the “Slide Sorter” button. Then, using your mouse, drag the slides to their preferred locations.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Rearrange photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7: Add Transitions</p>
<p>Transitions are essential for tying the presentation together and allowing it to flow smoothly from one image to the next. Go to the “Transitions” tab at the top of the bar and experiment with the various possibilities.</p>

                      alt="Add Transition"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: Add a Background.</p>
<p>If the white space around the edges of your photographs bothers you, right-click on any slide, choose “Format Background,” and then adjust the background fill. You may change the hue, direction, and transparency of a solid fill, a gradient fill, etc. To make your slides look more professional,</p>

                      alt="Add Background"
                ></p>
<p>Step 9: Save your PowerPoint</p>
<p>Before exiting, save your show once you’ve finished adding photos and graphics. If you named and saved your presentation at the start, all you have to do now is click the flash drive icon in the upper left corner.</p>

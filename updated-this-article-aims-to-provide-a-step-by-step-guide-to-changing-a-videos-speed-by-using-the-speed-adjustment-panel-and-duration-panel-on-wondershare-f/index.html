<p>Similarly, slow-motion videos are the ones that have been slowed down from their average speed. The slow-motion effect, also known as the slow-mo effect, is widespread in modern cinema.</p>

<p>Now that we know what Fast and slow-motion videos are. Let’s understand their applications. Or how you can use them in your videos. Scroll below to learn more!</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-You-Change-the-Speed-of-Your-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-You-Change-the-Speed-of-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Should You Change the Speed of Your Videos?"></a>Part 2. Why Should You Change the Speed of Your Videos?</h2><p>The answer to this question would be that it’s a personal creative decision that will allow you to make your videos more engaging.</p>
<h3 id="Fast-Motion-Videos"><a href="#Fast-Motion-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Fast Motion Videos"></a>Fast Motion Videos</h3><p>Fast-motion videos are used in many areas of filming. For example, you can speed up your videos to create a funny video or shorten its length.</p>
<p>The fast-motion effect has many applications, such as cooking tutorial videos. For example, the step-by-step process of a cooking tutorial can be too long to fit into a single video. Or it could also help you in cases where you want to keep the length of the video short.</p>
<p>The fast motion of the steps will allow the viewer to quickly grasp the whole process without watching the entire video.</p>
<h3 id="Slow-Motion-Videos"><a href="#Slow-Motion-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Slow Motion Videos"></a>Slow Motion Videos</h3><p>You can also slow down your videos to give the viewers a more detailed perspective of a scene. Or you can also create a slow-mo video that offers a general surreal vibe.</p>
<p>A famous example is in action films. The producers of the first <strong>Matrix</strong> film used the Slow-mo effect in the famous bullet dodging scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="famous bullet dodging scene in the matrix"
                ></p>
<p>You may wonder how the film producers made the slow-mo effect. The technology at that time was less developed than the recent day. So, even you can create a slow-mo effect.</p>
<p>Before we get into the editing process, let’s first understand what you will need to change the speed of your videos!</p>

<p>To begin, you will need a good video editor. Wondershare Filmora is the best video editing software available. It has a very engaging system UI that allows inexperienced users to learn how to use it quickly. It also has a diverse collection of stock media. And not only that! It allows you to access reliable features to change the speed of a video.</p>
<p>You can change the speed of the video on Filmora by the speed adjustment panel or by the duration panel present above the timeline. It will adjust in just seconds with a few clicks. This feature makes Filmora more prior with editing tools.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Slowing down a video requires a shot at a higher frame rate. The greater the frame rate, the better will be the slow-mo quality. On the other hand, speeding up videos does not have a strict frame rate requirement.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-Can-You-Change-the-Speed-of-Your-Videos"><a href="#Part-4-How-Can-You-Change-the-Speed-of-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How Can You Change the Speed of Your Videos?"></a>Part 4. How Can You Change the Speed of Your Videos?</h2><p>Here you will learn two ways in which you can change the speed of your videos. The two methods to change the speed of your video are mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>The speed adjustment panel.</li>
<li>Duration panel settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get started with the editing process. The first method we will look into is the Speed Adjustment panel.</p>
<h3 id="1-Change-Speed-With-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel"><a href="#1-Change-Speed-With-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel" class="headerlink" title="1. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel"></a>1. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel</h3><p>The Speed Adjustment panel is the speed adjuster in the Wondershare Filmora software. This feature will give you a drag bar to adjust the speed of your video.</p>
<p>You can move the bar to the right to increase the speed of your video. Similarly, you can move it to the left to decrease the rate.</p>
<p>But before we use this feature, we will need to download the Filmora video editing software. So please scroll below to learn how to download it!</p>

                      alt="wondershare filmora importing video clips from pc directory"
                ></p>
<p>You can also import the files by another method. After you have opened Filmora, you can restore the Filmora Window size and import by dragging and dropping the clips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the cursor to select the video clips you want.</li>
<li>Then, drop them in the Filmora import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-6.png"
                      alt="import video clips by drag and drop"
                ></p>
<p>Filmora supports various formats for your video clips. They include the <strong>Mp4</strong>,   <strong>AVI</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>GIFs,</strong> and more.</p>
<p>After you have imported your video clips, add them to the timeline as shown below!</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-The-Timeline"><a href="#Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-The-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline"></a>Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline</h5><p>After you’ve imported clips in the Import window, drag them onto the timeline. Follow the steps outlined below to accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the clips into the import window and select them.</li>
<li>Then, <strong>insert</strong> them into the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora adding clips to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have our video clips in the timeline, we can start adjusting the speed.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Open-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel"><a href="#Step4-Open-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel"></a>Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel</h5><p>The speed adjustment panel, or the Uniform Speed, is the feature of Filmora that allows you to change the speed of your video. For example, to open the Unifrom Speed panel, do as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the <strong>pop-up</strong> column, scroll down till you see the <strong>Unifrom Speed</strong> option and click on it.</li>
<li>The speed controls will be shown in the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora unifrom speed tab"
                ></p>
<p>In the speed control panel, you can see the speed adjuster slider. A number will usually mark this at the end. This number tells you the current speed your video is calibrated in and how fast or slow the motion effects will be.</p>
<p><strong>1.00</strong> is always the average speed. <strong>0.5</strong> being half and <strong>2.00</strong> being double the average speed. To control the speed through the slider, you will need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To increase the speed:</strong> Type in the number you want your rate to be. Or, drag the slider to the right as you wish.</li>
<li><strong>To decrease the speed:</strong> Type in a number less than the standard 1.00, or you can drag the slider to the left as you wish.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of your speed can be an inconvenience if you have no prior experience. Instead, render the video and play it from the beginning with the changes that you made. It gives you a better idea of the speed of your video.</p>

<p>Wait till Wondershare Filmora finishes exporting your video. Then, another window will pop up for a reminder when the shipping is done.</p>
<p>These were the methods by which you can change the speed of your video using the Speed Adjustment panel. Now let’s move on to the following method to adjust the speed via the Duration panel.</p>
<h3 id="2-Change-Speed-via-the-Duration-Panel"><a href="#2-Change-Speed-via-the-Duration-Panel" class="headerlink" title="2. Change Speed via the Duration Panel"></a>2. Change Speed via the Duration Panel</h3><p>The duration panel is one the most valuable features of Wondershare Filmora as it allows you to change the video speed by duration adjustment.</p>
<p>This feature is typically helpful when you have a space between video clips and want to fill it. By measuring the time between the two clips, you can adjust the duration of your video.</p>
<p>It will ultimately hasten the speed of your video. The hastening in rate will depend upon the gap. The smaller the gap, the faster the video will be. Similarly, the greater the gap is, the longer the video will be.</p>
<p>Apart from the Speed Adjustment Panel, the Duration Panel has the advantage of editing the speed of your video by simply typing in the text.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Import-Video-Clips-to-Timeline"><a href="#Step1-Import-Video-Clips-to-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline"></a>Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline</h5><p>After downloading Filmora, the next step is importing your video clips. To do so, follow the steps outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate and click the <strong>Import</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the Filmora Home Interface.</li>
<li>Choose the videos to be edited, then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have imported files into Filmora, you can add them to the Timeline. Notice the steps mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag the clips into the import window and select them.</li>
<li>Then, insert them into the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can begin the editing process now that the clips are in the timeline.</p>
<h5 id="Step2-Open-The-Duration-Panel"><a href="#Step2-Open-The-Duration-Panel" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Open The Duration Panel"></a>Step2 Open The Duration Panel</h5><p>The Duration Panel comes attached to the <strong>Unifrom Speed Panel</strong>. To access the Duration Panel, follow the steps ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the pop column, scroll below to <strong>Unifrom Speed</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will open the uniform speed panel in the import window. Below the speed of the controls, you can notice The Duration Panel.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Change-The-Speed-of-The-Video"><a href="#Step3-Change-The-Speed-of-The-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Change The Speed of The Video"></a>Step3 Change The Speed of The Video</h5><p>In The Duration Panel, you can see the average speed of your video clip. Now, if you want to <strong>reduce</strong> the speed of your video, you have to <strong>increase</strong> the duration of your video. Similarly, if you’re going to <strong>increase</strong> the speed of your video, you would have to <strong>decrease</strong> the duration.</p>
<h5 id="Slow-Down-The-Video"><a href="#Slow-Down-The-Video" class="headerlink" title="Slow Down The Video"></a>Slow Down The Video</h5><p>To slow down the video clip, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>In The Duration Panel, <strong>Increase</strong> the time of the video.</li>
<li>Type in a number bigger than the normal value</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the average speed of the video is <strong>00:01:00:00,</strong> increasing the value of the duration to <strong>00:02:00:00</strong> will reduce the speed of your video by half.</p>

How Can You Change the Speed of Your Videos?"></a>Part 4. How Can You Change the Speed of Your Videos?</h2><p>Here you will learn two ways in which you can change the speed of your videos. The two methods to change the speed of your video are mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>The speed adjustment panel.</li>
<li>Duration panel settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get started with the editing process. The first method we will look into is the Speed Adjustment panel.</p>
<h3 id="1-Change-Speed-With-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel-1"><a href="#1-Change-Speed-With-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel"></a>1. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel</h3><p>The Speed Adjustment panel is the speed adjuster in the Wondershare Filmora software. This feature will give you a drag bar to adjust the speed of your video.</p>
<p>You can move the bar to the right to increase the speed of your video. Similarly, you can move it to the left to decrease the rate.</p>
<p>But before we use this feature, we will need to download the Filmora video editing software. So please scroll below to learn how to download it!</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Download-Filmora-1"><a href="#Step1-Download-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Download Filmora"></a>Step1 Download Filmora</h5><p>First and foremost, you must have access to Filmora. For this, download Wondershare Filmora. Then, activate this app or software on your PC.</p>

                      alt="wondershare filmora importing video clips from pc directory"
                ></p>
<p>You can also import the files by another method. After you have opened Filmora, you can restore the Filmora Window size and import by dragging and dropping the clips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the cursor to select the video clips you want.</li>
<li>Then, drop them in the Filmora import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-6.png"
                      alt="import video clips by drag and drop"
                ></p>
<p>Filmora supports various formats for your video clips. They include the <strong>Mp4</strong>,   <strong>AVI</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>GIFs,</strong> and more.</p>
<p>After you have imported your video clips, add them to the timeline as shown below!</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-The-Timeline-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-The-Timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline"></a>Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline</h5><p>After you’ve imported clips in the Import window, drag them onto the timeline. Follow the steps outlined below to accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the clips into the import window and select them.</li>
<li>Then, <strong>insert</strong> them into the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora adding clips to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have our video clips in the timeline, we can start adjusting the speed.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Open-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel-1"><a href="#Step4-Open-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel"></a>Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel</h5><p>The speed adjustment panel, or the Uniform Speed, is the feature of Filmora that allows you to change the speed of your video. For example, to open the Unifrom Speed panel, do as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the <strong>pop-up</strong> column, scroll down till you see the <strong>Unifrom Speed</strong> option and click on it.</li>
<li>The speed controls will be shown in the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-8.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora unifrom speed tab"
                ></p>
<p>In the speed control panel, you can see the speed adjuster slider. A number will usually mark this at the end. This number tells you the current speed your video is calibrated in and how fast or slow the motion effects will be.</p>
<p><strong>1.00</strong> is always the average speed. <strong>0.5</strong> being half and <strong>2.00</strong> being double the average speed. To control the speed through the slider, you will need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To increase the speed:</strong> Type in the number you want your rate to be. Or, drag the slider to the right as you wish.</li>
<li><strong>To decrease the speed:</strong> Type in a number less than the standard 1.00, or you can drag the slider to the left as you wish.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of your speed can be an inconvenience if you have no prior experience. Instead, render the video and play it from the beginning with the changes that you made. It gives you a better idea of the speed of your video.</p>

<p>Wait till Wondershare Filmora finishes exporting your video. Then, another window will pop up for a reminder when the shipping is done.</p>
<p>These were the methods by which you can change the speed of your video using the Speed Adjustment panel. Now let’s move on to the following method to adjust the speed via the Duration panel.</p>
<h3 id="2-Change-Speed-via-the-Duration-Panel-1"><a href="#2-Change-Speed-via-the-Duration-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Change Speed via the Duration Panel"></a>2. Change Speed via the Duration Panel</h3><p>The duration panel is one the most valuable features of Wondershare Filmora as it allows you to change the video speed by duration adjustment.</p>
<p>This feature is typically helpful when you have a space between video clips and want to fill it. By measuring the time between the two clips, you can adjust the duration of your video.</p>
<p>It will ultimately hasten the speed of your video. The hastening in rate will depend upon the gap. The smaller the gap, the faster the video will be. Similarly, the greater the gap is, the longer the video will be.</p>
<p>Apart from the Speed Adjustment Panel, the Duration Panel has the advantage of editing the speed of your video by simply typing in the text.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Import-Video-Clips-to-Timeline-1"><a href="#Step1-Import-Video-Clips-to-Timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline"></a>Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline</h5><p>After downloading Filmora, the next step is importing your video clips. To do so, follow the steps outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate and click the <strong>Import</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the Filmora Home Interface.</li>
<li>Choose the videos to be edited, then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have imported files into Filmora, you can add them to the Timeline. Notice the steps mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag the clips into the import window and select them.</li>
<li>Then, insert them into the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can begin the editing process now that the clips are in the timeline.</p>
<h5 id="Step2-Open-The-Duration-Panel-1"><a href="#Step2-Open-The-Duration-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Open The Duration Panel"></a>Step2 Open The Duration Panel</h5><p>The Duration Panel comes attached to the <strong>Unifrom Speed Panel</strong>. To access the Duration Panel, follow the steps ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the pop column, scroll below to <strong>Unifrom Speed</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will open the uniform speed panel in the import window. Below the speed of the controls, you can notice The Duration Panel.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Change-The-Speed-of-The-Video-1"><a href="#Step3-Change-The-Speed-of-The-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Change The Speed of The Video"></a>Step3 Change The Speed of The Video</h5><p>In The Duration Panel, you can see the average speed of your video clip. Now, if you want to <strong>reduce</strong> the speed of your video, you have to <strong>increase</strong> the duration of your video. Similarly, if you’re going to <strong>increase</strong> the speed of your video, you would have to <strong>decrease</strong> the duration.</p>
<h5 id="Slow-Down-The-Video-1"><a href="#Slow-Down-The-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Slow Down The Video"></a>Slow Down The Video</h5><p>To slow down the video clip, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>In The Duration Panel, <strong>Increase</strong> the time of the video.</li>
<li>Type in a number bigger than the normal value</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the average speed of the video is <strong>00:01:00:00,</strong> increasing the value of the duration to <strong>00:02:00:00</strong> will reduce the speed of your video by half.</p>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<p>Read Aloud is not exactly a stand-alone Mac software but instead, a Chrome extension which might be appealing to some people.

It is completely free and once it is installed, its icon will be displayed in the extension bar which can now be use to read any webpage or any article found online just by a single click. When it is in use, you get a play&#x2F;pause button alongside a forward or rewind button which can be useful in advancing or backtracking paragraphs.

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<p>Renderforest maintains all your projects on your dashboard for as long as you use the service, so you don’t have to fear that you’ll lose your work..</p>
<h2 id="Pricing"><a href="#Pricing" class="headerlink" title="Pricing"></a>Pricing</h2><p>Regarding costs, Renderforest provides four different kinds of subscription options. The Free, Amateur, Pro, and Business plans are among them. The Free program makes a fantastic study aid. It’s possible to take your time with it, hone your talents, and upgrade to the paid plans after becoming familiar with the platform.</p>
<p>Regarding the free plan, you may watch and share your films on social media but not download them. You must utilize one of the paying subscriptions to download your videos. Choose the Business package if you don’t want Renderforest’s watermark to appear on your video. If you select monthly billing, it will cost you $149.99 per month or $49.99 per year.</p>
<p>If you want to take your company to the next level with distinctive videos, think about selecting one of the expertly produced video production packages. The starting package, which starts at $699, is the least priced.</p>
<h2 id="Tutorial-on-How-to-Create-an-Intro-Using-Renderforest"><a href="#Tutorial-on-How-to-Create-an-Intro-Using-Renderforest" class="headerlink" title="Tutorial on How to Create an Intro Using Renderforest"></a>Tutorial on How to Create an Intro Using Renderforest</h2><p>Professional video creators are likely aware that starting a video without a suitable introduction is equivalent to sneaking into someone’s house without permission. A good intro is a doorbell to let people know you’ve arrived.</p>
<p>A strong introduction ensures that more people will view your film. Adults have an attention span of about 12 seconds, according to studies from 2000. It is now only 8 seconds. You have 8 seconds to entice viewers to watch your video, so don’t waste it. A captivating introduction will give your content a professional touch and pique your audience’s interest. This task is worthwhile if you want to advertise your videos successfully.</p>
<p>These days, you don’t necessarily need to hire a pro to make a film if you need one. The majority of the available tools are free. We’ll demonstrate in this lesson how to use Renderforest to create a polished video intro. Our intro maker will let you start strong, whether for a fun birthday video or commercial use.</p>
<p>When you’re prepared to begin producing your videos, go to Renderforest, register for an account, or sign in if you already have one.</p>
<p>Check out the vast selection of templates under “<strong>Intros and logos</strong>“ in the “<strong>Create Video</strong>“ section of the navigation menu. Here, you can select the intro you like most and begin altering it, or use our advanced search filters to locate the specific content you require.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-intros-and-logos-renderforest.jpg"
                      alt="select intros and logos renderforest"
                ></p>
<p>We’ll use the “<strong>Swift Glitch Logo</strong>“ template for this tutorial, enabling you to present your logo with glitch effects. This template may produce intro and outro movies for presentations, your YouTube channel, lobby backgrounds, and other uses.</p>
<p>Select your preferred template and click the “<strong>Create now</strong>“ button to start.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="swift glitch logo renderforest"
                ></p>
<p>Your logo should now be uploaded with a transparent background (PNG). You can upload it in one of three ways: using an image URL directly from your device or selecting an existing file from your “Media library.” If you don’t already have one, you may make one right away using our logo maker tool, which is also accessible in the editor.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit image for intro video renderforest"
                ></p>
<p>Write your company’s name, tagline, or other brief words in the text field once you’ve added your logo. To save the changes, don’t forget to click “Save and close.”</p>
<p>You can select the overall design of your logo and the preferred font style in the “Style” section.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select style look for intro renderforest"
                ></p>
<p>Select your preferred color scheme in the “<strong>Color</strong>“ section now. You can choose between two color schemes made by our design team and manually selectable custom colors in this section.</p>
<p>Go to the “<strong>Music</strong>“ area to select a song for your intro. You can add one or pick from our “<strong>Music collection</strong>.” You can record a voice-over in the editor or upload one for your introduction.</p>
<p>Well done! Let’s check out your introduction in the “<strong>Preview</strong>“ area now. Click “<strong>Free preview</strong>“ to check your video and ensure you like the outcome. Click back and tweak the introduction if you need to make any adjustments.</p>
<p>Instantly create professional introduction videos in your browser! Utilize our intro maker, and let its unique touch set your videos apart from the competition.</p>

<h2 id="Competition-to-Renderforest"><a href="#Competition-to-Renderforest" class="headerlink" title="Competition to Renderforest"></a>Competition to Renderforest</h2><p>Animoto and PowToon are a couple of the site’s main rivals. These are excellent online video editing tools, but Renderforest stands out because it is simple to use and enables even novice users to create, share quickly, and download “broadcast grade videos.”</p>
<p><strong>Renderforest vs PowToon</strong></p>
<p>One of the most popular Renderforest Video alternatives available is PowToon. It’s challenging to decide which of these two platforms is superior because they are the best on the market. What you want as a business owner ultimately determines everything.</p>
<p>PowToon is a similar business that focuses on corporate videos but doesn’t provide the extra things Renderforest delivers (logo maker, graphic design, mockups, website builder). Pro customers pay $89 per month ($20 if invoiced annually), which is significantly more expensive than the alternative. Fortunately, they offer a complimentary bundle so you can sample the goods.</p>
<p>PowToon offers many more customizing choices than Renderforest because it is a video-based platform, but it will cost you.</p>
<p>Renderforest is a more cost-effective option if you need a range of services for your small business. PowToon is a better option for more prominent firms seeking a professional video creation platform.</p>
<p>Currently, some internet video services might be pricey and time-consuming to use. Renderforest will be welcomed by many small businesses looking for an economical and user-friendly online video editing platform.</p>
<p>Renderforest combines the top tools under a single subscription bundle in terms of features. In the end, you can manage your website, branding, and marketing visual production for less than $25 per month.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you don’t have to believe us. You may experience all the main advantages of Renderforest yourself by giving it a try. Check out the pros and drawbacks list in our Renderforest review if you need more assistance.</p>

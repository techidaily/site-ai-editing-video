The mixture of the turbulent and serene environment is enough to set the Halloween mood and even scare some folks.</p>
<p>Remember the scene from the movie “The Fog” and its famous dialogues: When the fog rolls in the terror begin! If you do not, take a look at a scene and judge for yourself if scary enough or not.</p>

Well, nothing! So, why not create a prank video for your friends and family, especially those afraid of Sadako? Plus, Sadako creates a perfect backdrop for the countdown. Look at this Philippines creator who went to great lengths to scare his friends via a Sadako video call.</p>
<p>But you do not have to go through all that costume and scenery setup. Instead, you can use the video footage on any premium video and apply Sadako ghost via Green Screen.</p>

What will you serve? Cupcakes sound like a good idea. But how will you entice your guest with your Halloween cupcakes? Well, you can include the cupcakes in the invitation video. While you can find many Halloween creative and savory cupcake recipes on YouTube, you can use stock footage to have them in the video.</p>

But simply using apps or replacing the wallpaper on your friend’s or spouse’s mobile doesn’t cut in this age and day. With new technology coming in, you have to get creative. Plus, it’s for Halloween, meaning dead skulls are a must.</p>

You will find tons of videos on Halloween Horror houses on the internet. Look at how Jackie from Super Enthused (YouTube channel) gets scared while touring the 10 Halloween horror houses at the theme park. That was really scary, and this Halloween countdown effect can also help you do the same to your viewers.</p>

No doubt, such pranks can scare anyone, not just kids. If you do not believe me, look at the reaction video from Infinite featuring scaring clowns’ pranks.</p>
<p>But how about dropping such a scary face bomb in a vacation countdown clock video? You can easily get your hands on creepy clowns’ portraits for videos via premium stock libraries like Filmora’s Filmstock.</p>

Given everyone will be in their costumes, you can also consider distributing self-made masks for everyone. You can take ideas from any of the numerous videos about Halloween mask design ideas.</p>

Well, it is the scary pumpkins. Carving out Jack-o’-lantern has long been the Halloween “tradition,” and featuring it in your countdown timer at the party is the most classic way to go about it. The vibe from simple Halloween buckets stacked together is on the next level; if you do not believe me, look at Angie Bellemare’s Halloween Bucket ideas and creativity:</p>

It doesn’t sound like much, but it really is enough to give the best feeling about Halloween without really indulging in the scary stuff. Take a look at how Jenn designs her Pumpkin Stack Fall Planter:</p>

When you imagine the scenario of dough mixing for the Halloween countdown timer video, it does not sound like much! But they are cool-looking and set the perfect backdrop for a countdown timer video:</p>
<p>You can use such clips individually or mix them with other stock video footage mentioned here to create a perfect Halloween vacation countdown clock video clip.</p>

<p><strong>Halloween Footage for Vertical Videos [TikTok&#x2F;Instagram Story]:</strong></p>
<p>The above list discusses the panoramic footage suitable for big screens. If your screen is rather a vertical one, then you might be looking for vertical stock footage for the Halloween vacation countdown clock clip. Here are some vertical footage ideas and links to stock footage to create the perfect vertical vacation countdown clock video for Halloween:</p>
<h3 id="1-Woman-Decorating-for-Halloween-TikTok"><a href="#1-Woman-Decorating-for-Halloween-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="1.

And while you can use your own footage of decorating the house, chances are you may have missed filming yourself while decorating the house, given not everyone films themselves decorating the house and use it for their TikTok video. Here’s a video from Spooky Bones featuring the indoor decoration process for Halloween.</p>

In fact, if you are looking for the users to focus on the timer instead of footage is to use a slo-mo video, like this one from Tay. Tay tells a story about a real haunted house in her neighborhood while wearing scary Halloween makeup.</p>
<p>Of course, you can replace the story; and instead, use a clock with a girl wearing Halloween makeup.</p>

After all, Halloween is all about setting the perfect theme, and featuring a non-relevant indoor or scary video outdoors spoils the theme. Take a look at how Stephanie Cunningham on TikTok showcases her outdoor table decoration setup for Halloween.</p>

The mixture of the turbulent and serene environment is enough to set the Halloween mood and even scare some folks.</p>
<p>Remember the scene from the movie “The Fog” and its famous dialogues: When the fog rolls in the terror begin! If you do not, take a look at a scene and judge for yourself if scary enough or not.</p>

Given everyone will be in their costumes, you can also consider distributing self-made masks for everyone. You can take ideas from any of the numerous videos about Halloween mask design ideas.</p>

Well, it is the scary pumpkins. Carving out Jack-o’-lantern has long been the Halloween “tradition,” and featuring it in your countdown timer at the party is the most classic way to go about it. The vibe from simple Halloween buckets stacked together is on the next level; if you do not believe me, look at Angie Bellemare’s Halloween Bucket ideas and creativity:</p>

It doesn’t sound like much, but it really is enough to give the best feeling about Halloween without really indulging in the scary stuff.

When you imagine the scenario of dough mixing for the Halloween countdown timer video, it does not sound like much! But they are cool-looking and set the perfect backdrop for a countdown timer video:</p>

<p><strong>Halloween Footage for Vertical Videos [TikTok&#x2F;Instagram Story]:</strong></p>
<p>The above list discusses the panoramic footage suitable for big screens. If your screen is rather a vertical one, then you might be looking for vertical stock footage for the Halloween vacation countdown clock clip. Here are some vertical footage ideas and links to stock footage to create the perfect vertical vacation countdown clock video for Halloween:</p>
<h3 id="1-Woman-Decorating-for-Halloween-TikTok-1"><a href="#1-Woman-Decorating-for-Halloween-TikTok-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Woman Decorating for Halloween [TikTok]"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/woman-decorating-for-halloween-43000095742.html" >Woman Decorating for Halloween [TikTok] <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Another simple backdrop for the Halloween countdown timer video is the decorations process to transform your indoors or outdoors for Halloween. And while you can use your own footage of decorating the house, chances are you may have missed filming yourself while decorating the house, given not everyone films themselves decorating the house and use it for their TikTok video. Here’s a video from Spooky Bones featuring the indoor decoration process for Halloween.</p>

In fact, if you are looking for the users to focus on the timer instead of footage is to use a slo-mo video, like this one from Tay. Tay tells a story about a real haunted house in her neighborhood while wearing scary Halloween makeup.</p>
<p>Of course, you can replace the story; and instead, use a clock with a girl wearing Halloween makeup.</p>

After all, Halloween is all about setting the perfect theme, and featuring a non-relevant indoor or scary video outdoors spoils the theme. Take a look at how Stephanie Cunningham on TikTok showcases her outdoor table decoration setup for Halloween.</p>

There are many ways to go about when looking to feature a mummy in the countdown clock; one idea is to show you made the mummy costumes, like Vina’s getup video on TikTok.</p>

Color combinations help us to make these designs more attractive. But earlier, there were some limitations in Canva regarding the color picker tool; designers had to use browser extensions like ColorZilla to match the color combinations perfectly. They faced many problems while selecting the perfect color of their choice while designing their pins, social media content, logos, online invitations, etc. They had to find the perfect color code of their choice from an external source and paste it into the Canva, which was simply very time-consuming.</p>
<p>The most-awaited color picker tool was introduced in Canva at the end of November 202This new design tool makes the design very convenient while using Canva for graphic designing. With this tool, you don’t need to spend hours searching for the right color that matches the background.

<p>The most-awaited color picker tool was introduced in Canva at the end of November 202This new design tool makes the design very convenient while using Canva for graphic designing. With this tool, you don’t need to spend hours searching for the right color that matches the background. Color picker helps you to find a perfect color match according to the image, logo, or anything else uploaded on Canva.</p>

<p>But before using this new <strong>color match tool</strong>, you must ensure that:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You are using the updated version of the Canva desktop app.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You have the latest version of the browsers like Chrome, Mozilla, Internet Explorer, etc.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> A color pallet will open.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> On the top of the color pallet, you will see a ‘+’ (add new color) button, this button has a colorful square outline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> After this, a color chart will appear under that button. You will see the color code written over there and an eyedropper tool will be available next to that color code (hex code).</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Click on this eyedropper tool and select the color of your choice either from the image or any other color available in Canva.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> After selecting the color tap on the particular part of the image whose color you want to change.</p>

But there are certain limitations of using it, so here we have listed some of the other graphic designing tools for both image and video editing that can be used as an alternative to the Canva app:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Visme:</strong> It is a drag and drops editing and graphic designing tool. Using; this tool is effortless to use, and you can easily create attractive presentations, infographics, social media graphics, logos, etc. This tool can be used by anyone like students (to create their school activities), educators (to create easy to learn infographics), business people (to create attractive presentations), graphic designers (to create different content), etc.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Data Visualization Tools</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Variety of Professionally Designed Easy to Use Templates</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Infographic Maker</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A Large Number of Editing Tools</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Animation Feature with Hover Effects</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Analytics Feature</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Adobe Spark</strong>: It is an online tool launched by Adobe. Although it can’t compete with professional software like Photoshop and Illustrator, it can be treated as the best alternative for Canva. It is used to create social media posts, logos, and graphic designs easily and efficiently. The only limitation it has is that non-designers and newcomers can’t use it without any knowledge of graphic design.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>PicMonkey</strong>: PicMonkey is another great alternative to Canva, just like Visme. It has many features that help both professional and non-professional designers create attractive and wonderful designs very easily and efficiently. It has many exciting features like photo re-toucher, pattern &amp; effects tools, etc., just like Photoshop, but it is relatively easier to use and can be used by anyone who wants to create beautiful and creative graphic designs.</p>

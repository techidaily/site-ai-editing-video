It is better ideal for professional videographers and those who are online content creators due to its distinctive and professional appearing productions. It can handle all the contemporary video formats, including video editing and output for HD and 4K. It offers a broad selection of easy-to-use capabilities that may assist you to produce lesson films, editing action camera footage and building viral movies like those used on social networking websites, and more. If you have various shades of green, you may chroma key a source many times, each time specifying a distinct shade of green. Without any correction, merely putting on the Chroma Key filter will probably look quite horrible. But happily, there is a variety of options where you may fine-tune the chroma key removal. So, with Filmora, it is better appropriate for short films and it is giving you the most value for its pricing.</p>

Chroma keying is used to erase the backdrop of a video clip which is then composited over another scene or picture. The most apparent usage of this technology is for weather broadcasts when the presenter is composited over the top of a weather radar picture. In more recent times we’re seeing video game broadcasters chroma keying themselves into their live feeds. There are various sites to explore for streaming backdrops. Most come as overlay packages with distinct themes. A good location to look is Filmora.

Then, playback the animation of the text, find a position before the text animation starts and move the play head there.

<p>Click to add a keyframe, double-check to make sure it is the final position you want, and the opacity should be 100 at this point.</p>
<p>After that, move the play head to the left for a few frames and click add again. To make sure the white line is out of the frame before entering, you need to change the Y-axis number. Change the opacity to 0 as the white line starts in transparent color.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>You don’t need to change the setting this time because this keyframe is used to keep the position and opacity unchanged.</p>
<p>Instead, move the play head again to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe. Move the texts out of the frame by changing the y-axis number, then change the opacity to 0. This keyframe is used to create the white line animation exiting the frame and turning back to transparent in the meantime.</p>

<p>Sometimes you might want to create a name card with a solid background like the sample above. To create it, we can use the same method. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Make-the-lower-third-background"><a href="#Step1-Make-the-lower-third-background" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Make the lower third background"></a>Step1 Make the lower third background</h5><p>Select the white color sample from the sample color folder and drop it onto the upper video track of the video.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Similar to the tutorial before, move the play head again a few frames earlier to the left and add another keyframe. If you want to have the name card flying in from the left while expanding, you can change the X-axis and scale of the background card to 0. Change the opacity to 0 to create a color change from transparent to white.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="move the play head again"
                ></p>
<p>To let the background card exit the frame, add two more keyframes to the background card. Add a keyframe with no changes to settings. Move the play head to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="add two more keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>If you want the name card to exit to the bottom, change the Y-axis number until it exits. Change the scale and opacity to 0. Then, playback and adjust the keyframes.</p>
<p>Finally, you can add a Subscribe button from the new default Filmora element pack “Social Media.”</p>

                      alt="move the play head to the left"
                ></p>
<p>These two keyframes will create an effect of the line entering the frame while turning from transparent to white. Playback the animation and adjust the keyframes marks by dragging them to the left or right until you feel the timing looks good.</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Add-keyframes-to-the-white-line-clip-when-exiting-1"><a href="#Step6-Add-keyframes-to-the-white-line-clip-when-exiting-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting"></a>Step6 Add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting</h5><p>Playback again to find where the texts disappear, then move the play head to a position after it. Also, make sure it’s close enough to where the texts disappear so you can ensure the white line exits right after the texts disappear. Then, add the keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting"
                ></p>
<p>You don’t need to change the setting this time because this keyframe is used to keep the position and opacity unchanged.</p>
<p>Instead, move the play head again to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe. Move the texts out of the frame by changing the y-axis number, then change the opacity to 0. This keyframe is used to create the white line animation exiting the frame and turning back to transparent in the meantime.</p>

<p>Playback the video and see how it looks.</p>

                      alt="a name card with a solid background"
                ></p>
<p>Sometimes you might want to create a name card with a solid background like the sample above. To create it, we can use the same method. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Make-the-lower-third-background-1"><a href="#Step1-Make-the-lower-third-background-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Make the lower third background"></a>Step1 Make the lower third background</h5><p>Select the white color sample from the sample color folder and drop it onto the upper video track of the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-14.jpg"
                      alt="make the lower third background"
                ></p>
<p>Change the scale to 30%, then reposition the white sample to your desired place. Click OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-15.gif"
                      alt="change the scale to 30%"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step2-Create-an-image-mask-for-the-lower-third-background-1"><a href="#Step2-Create-an-image-mask-for-the-lower-third-background-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Create an image mask for the lower third background"></a>Step2 Create an image mask for the lower third background</h5><p>Drag and drop the Image Mask onto the white sample clip on the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create an image mask"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the white sample clip to activate the video setting window and find the Image Mask settings. Then, choose the mask shape you need. You can also adjust its size by changing the X or Y-axis.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="double-click on the white sample clip"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-some-text-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-some-text-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add some text"></a>Step3 Add some text</h5><p>Once the background card is in place, go to Titles &gt; Plain Text &gt; ‘Basic 6’ and drop it onto the third video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-18.jpg"
                      alt="go to titles"
                ></p>
<p>Now, type in the texts as needed. Reposition and scale the texts to make sure they are on top of the background shape.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-19.jpg"
                      alt="type in the texts"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-animation-to-the-text-3"><a href="#Step4-Add-animation-to-the-text-3" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add animation to the text"></a>Step4 Add animation to the text</h5><p>Click Advanced &gt; Animation &gt; Push. Then, adjust the animation length accordingly. Click Ok.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-20.jpg"
                      alt="click advanced"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the background clip to show the animation tab setting. Then, playback the text animation and find a position earlier than the start and add a keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-21.jpg"
                      alt="double-click on the background clip"
                ></p>
<p>Similar to the tutorial before, move the play head again a few frames earlier to the left and add another keyframe. If you want to have the name card flying in from the left while expanding, you can change the X-axis and scale of the background card to 0. Change the opacity to 0 to create a color change from transparent to white.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-22.gif"
                      alt="move the play head again"
                ></p>
<p>To let the background card exit the frame, add two more keyframes to the background card. Add a keyframe with no changes to settings. Move the play head to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-23.gif"
                      alt="add two more keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>If you want the name card to exit to the bottom, change the Y-axis number until it exits. Change the scale and opacity to 0. Then, playback and adjust the keyframes.</p>
<p>Finally, you can add a Subscribe button from the new default Filmora element pack “Social Media.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-24.jpg"
                      alt="add a subscribe button"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Wrapping-up-1"><a href="#Wrapping-up-1" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping up"></a>Wrapping up</h2><p>These are two ways you can create your own Lower Thirds in FIlmora. You can also change the keyframe settings to customize your lower thirds even more. Now, it’s time to try it yourself, and let us know what you think!</p>

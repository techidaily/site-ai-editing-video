Ideas for Making an Outstanding Educational Teaching Video"></a>Part 1. Ideas for Making an Outstanding Educational Teaching Video</h2><p>Creating an educational video is not enough. There are a few elements that should be kept in mind. Your content should be good enough. Another thing that needs attention is your viewers’ interest. Your educational video is of no use if it cannot sustain the audience’s interest.</p>
<p>What could be done to improve your videos? How can someone create outstanding educational teaching videos? All your questions will be answered in this section of the article. We are going to share ideas for good educational videos.</p>
<h3 id="·-Digital-Storytelling"><a href="#·-Digital-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="· Digital Storytelling"></a>· Digital Storytelling</h3><p>How can digital storytelling help in educational videos? Well, it’s simple. You need to attract and motivate students to study. For this purpose, digital storytelling is the best choice. You can merge different images and videos.</p>
<p>Add cute images from your institute. Insert videos of students working together. All these will attract the student to study.</p>
<h3 id="·-Get-Dressed"><a href="#·-Get-Dressed" class="headerlink" title="· Get Dressed"></a>· Get Dressed</h3><p>Do you think someone will listen to you with interest if you don’t have a personality? What we wear, how we present ourselves show our personality. If you want to create stunning educational videos, then work a little on yourself first.</p>
<p>Before you start recording, make sure you are well dressed. The more formally you present yourself, the more your students will be attracted.</p>
<h3 id="·-Plan-Everything"><a href="#·-Plan-Everything" class="headerlink" title="· Plan Everything"></a>· Plan Everything</h3><p>A pro tip for creating outstanding educational videos is your planning. Before properly planning everything, you should never start making a video. You need to gather everything you might need during the video. You should properly compose yourself before you start speaking and teaching.</p>
<p>You should make a mind map of how you will explain things. A storyboard for the sequence of actions should be specified well before. It helps stay on top of things.</p>
<h3 id="·-Busy-World"><a href="#·-Busy-World" class="headerlink" title="· Busy World"></a>· Busy World</h3><p>What if the video you want to watch is too long and you don’t have that much time? We are very busy in different aspects. For this purpose, it is essential to keep in mind that the educational video should be concise. The video must deliver the actual concept but in a short span of time.</p>
<h3 id="·-Audience-Hunt"><a href="#·-Audience-Hunt" class="headerlink" title="· Audience Hunt"></a>· Audience Hunt</h3><p>You should have clear knowledge regarding your audience. You must know what content they are looking for. What platform is the most suitable for sharing your content? If you are putting effort into creating amazing educational videos, then a proper audience hunt is also necessary.</p>

<ol>
<li>Compression rate, bit depth, bit</li>
</ol>
<p>The amount of data the camera records each second is referred to as bit rate. Every single second of a video is subject to significant data processing by cameras. The higher the quality of the video, the more is the bit rate. Bit depth refers to the number of colors your camera can read per pixel. Common bit depths are 8-bit and 10-bit, which enable a camera to read 256 million or 1.07 billion colors respectively. To upload your edited video, a compression is usually required to convert your resolution to internet quality so that the upload can be made simpler, without distorting the video resolution.</p>

If you have regular graphic elements and texts, your video is not going to be as engaging as expected. That is why video creators always try to include trending and attention-grabbing effects and animations in the video. There is no doubt that 3D animations for texts and titles look really amazing.</p>
<p>Different video editors have different 3D text animations and effects that you can apply to the text on your video and get instantly noticed by your viewers. You can apply 3D text animation on premium video editors like After Effects as well as apply 3D text effect online. We will illustrate how to create stunning 3D text animations with different video editors in simple steps.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Create-True-3D-Text-Effects-using-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-1-Create-True-3D-Text-Effects-using-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Create True 3D Text Effects using After Effects"></a>Part 1. Create True 3D Text Effects using After Effects</h2><p>After Effects is a premium video editor where you can create true 3D text effect from scratch. First of all, you need to create a new composition and add your text to your video. You have to enable 3D option for the text and add depth and lighting texture to get 3D effect. Therefore, you should first create 3D text effect and thereafter, animate 3D text as per your preference. Here are the steps to create 3D text After Effects easily.</p>
<p>Step1Launch After Effects and click on New Composition from Project section. Set the different parameters on Composition Settings and click on Ok button.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>You have successfully created 3D text effect on After Effects. You will now illustrate how to animate the 3D text.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Create-3D-Camera-Animation"><a href="#Part-2-Create-3D-Camera-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Create 3D Camera Animation"></a>Part 2. Create 3D Camera Animation</h2><p>You have prepared your text with 3D effect, and you can have multiple 3D texts on your video. It is time to animate those 3D texts so that the 3D effect becomes more prominent and the text instantly grabs attention. You do not have to create animation from scratch as there are 3D animation presets available. All you need to do is apply them to your 3D texts and they will start to animate automatically. Besides, you can create 3D camera animation to show the texts from different camera perspectives. Here are the steps to use 3d animated text generator on After Effects.</p>
<p>Step1Once you have created your 3D text effect, go to Effects &amp; Presets panel.</p>
<p>Step2Go to Text&gt; 3D Text and you will see all the different 3D animation presets that you can apply.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step3Drag and drop your desired 3D animation directly to 3D text layer.</p>
<p>Step4If you want camera animation on your 3D text, select the Camera layer you already created. Press C to get the Orbit tool to get the starting position of the 3D text. You can also use Dolly tool and Pan &amp; Zoom tool for adjustment.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="get start position 3d text"
                ></p>
<p>Step5Now add a keyframe on Position option from Transform option to mark the starting point of the animation. Similarly, add another keyframe where you want the animation to end.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

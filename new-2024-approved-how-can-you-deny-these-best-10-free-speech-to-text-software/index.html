[Complete Guide]</h2><p>Slow-motion videos are in trend now, especially when shooting for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Reels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, TikTok videos, or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Shorts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. While many users record the entire video in slow motion, there are others who need only a particular section of a clip to play at a reduced speed. Nevertheless, slowing down footage is no longer rocket science, thanks to the advancements in technology, and the availability and ease of access to relevant apps.</p>
<p>That said, here you will learn what is needed to record a video in slow motion, and how to get the job done in a simple way. In addition, you will also learn how to reduce the playback speed of an already existing video if it was recorded at a normal pace.</p>

Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.</p>
<p>For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the <strong>SLO-MO</strong> mode.</p>

<p>Speed Ramping enables you to add the slow-motion effect at different parts of a video and even freeze the screen for the duration that you specify. The processes to get these done are given below in detail:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add Source Video to Timeline and Get to the Speed Ramping Window</strong></p>
<p>Use the process given in the previous method to import a source video to Wondershare Filmora 11 and add it to the Timeline. Then use the process given in the second step of the previous method to get to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Slow Motion Effect to Different Parts of the Clip</strong></p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> tab if it is not already selected, click <strong>Custom</strong> from the available options, and drag the adjustment points below the center line to reduce the playback speed for that particular section of the clip. Optionally, you can click any of the available presets to automatically add the slow-motion effect to the video.</p>
<p>Note: You can also drag the adjustment points above the line to increase the playback speed.</p>
<p>To add an adjustment point on the frame where it is not already present, place the playhead (skimmer) at the correct position, and click <strong>Add Adjust Point</strong> from the left of the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window itself. Once added, you can drag it downward to reduce the playback speed of that part of the clip.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-When-to-Use-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Part-3-When-to-Use-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?"></a>Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?</h2><p>There could be many instances when you want to add a slow-motion effect to your videos. Some of the most common ones include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Focus</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skill or Style Demonstration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replays</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Suspense</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.</p>
<p>In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.</p>

<p>Use the process given in the previous method to import a source video to Wondershare Filmora 11 and add it to the Timeline. Then use the process given in the second step of the previous method to get to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Slow Motion Effect to Different Parts of the Clip</strong></p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> tab if it is not already selected, click <strong>Custom</strong> from the available options, and drag the adjustment points below the center line to reduce the playback speed for that particular section of the clip. Optionally, you can click any of the available presets to automatically add the slow-motion effect to the video.</p>
<p>Note: You can also drag the adjustment points above the line to increase the playback speed.</p>
<p>To add an adjustment point on the frame where it is not already present, place the playhead (skimmer) at the correct position, and click <strong>Add Adjust Point</strong> from the left of the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window itself. Once added, you can drag it downward to reduce the playback speed of that part of the clip.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Freeze the Video</strong></p>
<p>Place the skimmer on the frame where you want to freeze the video for a while, and click <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong> from the left of the Speed Ramping window. When the time box appears, in the Freeze Time field, enter the duration in seconds you want to freeze the screen for, and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

Some of the most common ones include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Focus</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skill or Style Demonstration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replays</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Suspense</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.</p>
<p>In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.</p>

Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.</p>
<p>For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the <strong>SLO-MO</strong> mode.</p>

<p>Speed Ramping enables you to add the slow-motion effect at different parts of a video and even freeze the screen for the duration that you specify. The processes to get these done are given below in detail:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add Source Video to Timeline and Get to the Speed Ramping Window</strong></p>
<p>Use the process given in the previous method to import a source video to Wondershare Filmora 11 and add it to the Timeline. Then use the process given in the second step of the previous method to get to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Slow Motion Effect to Different Parts of the Clip</strong></p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> tab if it is not already selected, click <strong>Custom</strong> from the available options, and drag the adjustment points below the center line to reduce the playback speed for that particular section of the clip. Optionally, you can click any of the available presets to automatically add the slow-motion effect to the video.</p>
<p>Note: You can also drag the adjustment points above the line to increase the playback speed.</p>
<p>To add an adjustment point on the frame where it is not already present, place the playhead (skimmer) at the correct position, and click <strong>Add Adjust Point</strong> from the left of the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window itself. Once added, you can drag it downward to reduce the playback speed of that part of the clip.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Freeze the Video</strong></p>
<p>Place the skimmer on the frame where you want to freeze the video for a while, and click <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong> from the left of the Speed Ramping window. When the time box appears, in the Freeze Time field, enter the duration in seconds you want to freeze the screen for, and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-When-to-Use-Slow-Motion-3"><a href="#Part-3-When-to-Use-Slow-Motion-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?"></a>Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?</h2><p>There could be many instances when you want to add a slow-motion effect to your videos. Some of the most common ones include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Focus</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skill or Style Demonstration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replays</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Suspense</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.</p>
<p>In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.</p>

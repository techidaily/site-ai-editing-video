If yes, you are familiar with discord nitro and all the advantages that come with it. And if you are not a user, you probably are confused about discord Nitro. Let’s start with basic information on discord nitro and its use. Discord Nitro is the genre version of discord with multiple features, making it a worthy option.

<p>Of course, we have to thank content writer Ubaid Ullah for the article on how to get Discord GIF profile without nitro. After all, it is one of our reference points.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a GIF or download one that meets your taste from different websites. Currently, we have many sites offering free GIFs; hence you don’t have to worry about copyright issues. Some top websites to consider are Giphy, Gifer, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for a site that can translate a GIF document to the APNG file. Don’t worry about this step since you can always google the top options. We currently have the ezgif site but technology changes every day; hence you can expect rising websites.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Let’s use the ezgif website. Upon accessing it, ensure that you settle for the APNG maker icon. It is on the top left of the website.</p>

However, we will define the simplest way to make your profile pic a GIF in Discord in this case. Ensure that you read through this section.</p>
<p>Generally, discord nitro users are more privileged compared to normal discord users. Of course, the Nitro subscribers pay a fee to access these privileges. There are two options:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Making your profile picture a GIF</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Utilizing the Tenor GIFs</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Uploading them from your files</p>

                      alt="How to log into your account"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Visit the user settings gear icon and go to edit profile to access your account details.</p>
<p>Step 3: Click on your current profile or click on the Change Avatar option</p>
<p>Step 5: Use the available GIF search engine or upload files from your device. It depends on whether you are a Nitro subscriber or a normal user. Select your GIF and go to the Apply option to save the file</p>
<p>Step 6: Move to the escape button to exit the settings, and you realize that your PFP is officially a GIF.</p>

Otherwise, you need to look for GIFs from different websites and upload them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The maximum resolution of a GIF is 128 by 128 pixels hence you need to be careful.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The GIF file size for discord is at most 8MBs.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can create a GIF instead of uploading it from free websites.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Put-a-GIF-in-Discord-profile-Picture-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Put-a-GIF-in-Discord-profile-Picture-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to Put a GIF in Discord profile Picture?"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to Put a GIF in Discord profile Picture?</strong></h2><p>Discord is quite a popular platform with millions of users worldwide. Thanks to the user-friendly interface it includes, this number is enormous, especially when you wish to edit your profile picture. In our case, we explain facts about having a GIF as a PFP in discord.</p>
<p>Like most social media platforms, this process is relatively easy. It only requires you to be a discord user, and it is better if you are a nitro subscriber. Why? Because the latter have the discord GIF options easing the process. Note that you can still add a GIF even without nitro.</p>
<p>The first point is to log into your account, go to setting and click on the edit your profile option. Upon clicking on the available PFP, you will automatically access a file dialogue that prompts you to include your GIF. Later save these changes and get <strong>a GIF profile in discord.</strong></p>
<p>GIFs are like looping or repetitive short videos; hence they need editing. Fortunately, we have the <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> editor, which includes multiple features which assist in editing your work.

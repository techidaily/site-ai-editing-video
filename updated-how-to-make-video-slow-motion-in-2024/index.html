            <h2 id="How-to-Make-Video-Slow-Motion"><a href="#How-to-Make-Video-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="How to Make Video Slow Motion?"></a>How to Make Video Slow Motion?</h2><p>Slow-motion videos are in trend now, especially when shooting for <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram Reels <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, TikTok videos, or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >YouTube Shorts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. While many users record the entire video in slow motion, there are others who need only a particular section of a clip to play at a reduced speed. Nevertheless, slowing down footage is no longer rocket science, thanks to the advancements in technology, and the availability and ease of access to relevant apps.</p>
<p>That said, here you will learn what is needed to record a video in slow motion, and how to get the job done in a simple way. In addition, you will also learn how to reduce the playback speed of an already existing video if it was recorded at a normal pace.</p>

Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.</p>
<p>For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the <strong>SLO-MO</strong> mode.</p>

                      alt="iphone slow motion capture mode"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Recording Preferences</strong></p>
<p>Tap the number at the top-right corner to switch between <strong>120</strong> FPS and <strong>240</strong> FPS as needed. Tap <strong>1x</strong> from the lower-middle section of the screen, and use the rotator to adjust your preferred zoom level.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Start and Stop Recording</strong></p>
<p>Tap the <strong>Record</strong> button from the bottom-center of the screen to begin recording the video in slow motion. Tap <strong>Stop</strong> when you are done. You can access the recorded video from the <strong>Videos</strong> container of the <strong>Photos</strong> app in your iPhone.</p>

Even though several post-production applications are available in the market, the one that is most versatile, has an intuitive interface, and is quite easy to use is <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora video editor from Wondershare <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>The latest version of the app, i.e., Wondershare Filmora 11 has a new feature called Speed Ramping that enables you to graphically manage the speed of the clips. While using the feature, you can either slow down the entire video or certain parts of it according to your requirements. For your learning, both the methods are explained below:</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import the Source Video and Add to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Launch Wondershare Filmora on your Windows or Mac computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), click <strong>New Project</strong> from the first screen that appears. Make sure that the <strong>Media</strong> tool is selected from the standard tool bar at the top, click anywhere inside the <strong>Media</strong> window, and select and import the source clip to the program.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Slow Motion Effect to the Whole Clip</strong></p>
<p>Once the media is added to the timeline, click on it and then click the <strong>Speed</strong> icon on the toolbar.

<p>Speed Ramping enables you to add the slow-motion effect at different parts of a video and even freeze the screen for the duration that you specify. The processes to get these done are given below in detail:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add Source Video to Timeline and Get to the Speed Ramping Window</strong></p>
<p>Use the process given in the previous method to import a source video to Wondershare Filmora 11 and add it to the Timeline. Then use the process given in the second step of the previous method to get to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Slow Motion Effect to Different Parts of the Clip</strong></p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> tab if it is not already selected, click <strong>Custom</strong> from the available options, and drag the adjustment points below the center line to reduce the playback speed for that particular section of the clip. Optionally, you can click any of the available presets to automatically add the slow-motion effect to the video.</p>
<p>Note: You can also drag the adjustment points above the line to increase the playback speed.</p>
<p>To add an adjustment point on the frame where it is not already present, place the playhead (skimmer) at the correct position, and click <strong>Add Adjust Point</strong> from the left of the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window itself. Once added, you can drag it downward to reduce the playback speed of that part of the clip.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-When-to-Use-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Part-3-When-to-Use-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?"></a>Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?</h2><p>There could be many instances when you want to add a slow-motion effect to your videos. Some of the most common ones include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Focus</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skill or Style Demonstration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replays</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Suspense</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.</p>
<p>In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.</p>

Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.</p>
<p>For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the <strong>SLO-MO</strong> mode.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>Speed Ramping enables you to add the slow-motion effect at different parts of a video and even freeze the screen for the duration that you specify. The processes to get these done are given below in detail:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add Source Video to Timeline and Get to the Speed Ramping Window</strong></p>
<p>Use the process given in the previous method to import a source video to Wondershare Filmora 11 and add it to the Timeline. Then use the process given in the second step of the previous method to get to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Slow Motion Effect to Different Parts of the Clip</strong></p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> tab if it is not already selected, click <strong>Custom</strong> from the available options, and drag the adjustment points below the center line to reduce the playback speed for that particular section of the clip. Optionally, you can click any of the available presets to automatically add the slow-motion effect to the video.</p>
<p>Note: You can also drag the adjustment points above the line to increase the playback speed.</p>
<p>To add an adjustment point on the frame where it is not already present, place the playhead (skimmer) at the correct position, and click <strong>Add Adjust Point</strong> from the left of the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window itself. Once added, you can drag it downward to reduce the playback speed of that part of the clip.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Freeze the Video</strong></p>
<p>Place the skimmer on the frame where you want to freeze the video for a while, and click <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong> from the left of the Speed Ramping window. When the time box appears, in the Freeze Time field, enter the duration in seconds you want to freeze the screen for, and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

Some of the most common ones include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Focus</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skill or Style Demonstration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replays</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Suspense</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.</p>
<p>In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.</p>

Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.</p>
<p>For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the <strong>SLO-MO</strong> mode.</p>

Frequently in cases where the devices share different forms of resolution, it makes sharing videos a hassle.</p>
<p>In those situations, changing the resolution of your video can be a great idea. It will also allow you to save storage. In this article, you’ll adjust the resolution in just a few clicks by Wondershare Filmora. But before we learn how to change a video’s resolution, let’s look into what a video resolution is!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-Video-Resolution"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-Video-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is a Video Resolution?"></a>Part 1. What Is a Video Resolution?</h2><p>A video resolution, in short, is the quality of the video visible. A video is rendered at a specific rate whenever you watch a movie or go to a cinema. A screen is made up of <strong>tiny pixels</strong> and arranged in an order that determines the resolution of a screen.</p>
<p>Video resolution is rendered in a <strong>vertical</strong> and <strong>horizontal</strong> orientation. Therefore, whenever you play a video on YouTube, the resolution scale is available for you to choose from, i.e., <strong>480p</strong>, <strong>720p</strong>, <strong>1080p,</strong> etc.</p>
<p>In most cases, a resolution is dictated by the full abbreviation. So, for example, a <strong>720p</strong> video is <strong>1280 x 720,</strong> and a <strong>1080p</strong> video is a <strong>1920 x 1080</strong> resolution.</p>

                      alt="wondershare filmora importing clips to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Doing so would have added the video clips to the timeline. Instead, it has created a workplace to edit our videos.</p>
<p>You can <strong>trim</strong>, <strong>add effects</strong>, and <strong>join</strong> multiple clips in this process. After finishing the editing process, it’s time to select an export format.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Export-Your-Video"><a href="#Step4-Export-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Export Your Video"></a>Step4 Export Your Video</h5><p>You can export into video formats in two ways with Filmora. It can be either selecting a format for your video. Or you can also choose to export your video to a particular device.</p>
<p><strong>Video Format Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is a fantastic software that allows you to access a variety of formats for your videos. These export formats include <strong>MP4</strong>, <strong>WMV</strong>, <strong>F4V</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>TS</strong>, <strong>3GP</strong>, and more. To select a format for your video, follow the steps as guided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
<li>In the left column, click on the <strong>video</strong> format you need.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Export</strong> on the bottom right corner of the window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-11.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora selecting video format"
                ></p>
<p>Exporting a video in a specific format not only allows you to change the format of a video but also allows you to change the resolution simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Default Resolution Settings</strong></p>
<p>Some formats have a built-in resolution. Whenever you choose a specific format for a video, the resolution of the video will be shifted to the resolution of that format, i.e., <strong>TS</strong> has a default <strong>1080p</strong> resolution.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another thing to remember is that most video formats have defaulted to <strong>1080p</strong>. But there are some formats whose resolutions vary according to their style. A good example is a <strong>3GP</strong> format, which is set to <strong>352 x 488</strong> by default.</p>
<p><strong>Customize the Resolution</strong></p>
<p>But if you don’t find the resolution stable for your device, you can also change this default resolution in simple steps. In the export window, follow the steps mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the preset tab, go to &gt; <strong>settings</strong>.</li>
<li>In the video tab, click on the <strong>resolution</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, select the resolution that you desire.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also select a custom resolution by these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, click on <strong>Custom</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can change the height and width according to your wish.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Exporting a Video to a Specific Device</strong></p>
<p>Selecting a format for your video can help if you want to change the resolution. But in cases where you want to export a video to a particular mobile device. Such as an <strong>iPhone</strong> or an <strong>iPad</strong>, you can select the device export option.</p>
<p>In the device export option, you can select a custom device. Filmora allows you to choose from a wide variety of machines available when you choose a custom device; the resolution will be set to optimal for that particular device.</p>
<p><strong>Select a Folder to Export Your Video</strong></p>
<p>After you are done calibrating the resolution settings, you can move on to select the export location for your video. You can do so by the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the main Export window, navigate to the <strong>Save</strong></li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Folder</strong></li>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Final Step</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p>Now that we have our clips imported, it is time to add them to the timeline below!</p>

<ul>
<li>Hold Right click to drag and select the <strong>video clips</strong> in the import window.</li>
<li>Release Right-click when in the <strong>timeline</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="wondershare filmora importing clips to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Doing so would have added the video clips to the timeline. Instead, it has created a workplace to edit our videos.</p>
<p>You can <strong>trim</strong>, <strong>add effects</strong>, and <strong>join</strong> multiple clips in this process. After finishing the editing process, it’s time to select an export format.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Export-Your-Video-1"><a href="#Step4-Export-Your-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Export Your Video"></a>Step4 Export Your Video</h5><p>You can export into video formats in two ways with Filmora. It can be either selecting a format for your video. Or you can also choose to export your video to a particular device.</p>
<p><strong>Video Format Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is a fantastic software that allows you to access a variety of formats for your videos. These export formats include <strong>MP4</strong>, <strong>WMV</strong>, <strong>F4V</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>TS</strong>, <strong>3GP</strong>, and more. To select a format for your video, follow the steps as guided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
<li>In the left column, click on the <strong>video</strong> format you need.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Export</strong> on the bottom right corner of the window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-11.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora selecting video format"
                ></p>
<p>Exporting a video in a specific format not only allows you to change the format of a video but also allows you to change the resolution simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Default Resolution Settings</strong></p>
<p>Some formats have a built-in resolution. Whenever you choose a specific format for a video, the resolution of the video will be shifted to the resolution of that format, i.e., <strong>TS</strong> has a default <strong>1080p</strong> resolution.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another thing to remember is that most video formats have defaulted to <strong>1080p</strong>. But there are some formats whose resolutions vary according to their style. A good example is a <strong>3GP</strong> format, which is set to <strong>352 x 488</strong> by default.</p>
<p><strong>Customize the Resolution</strong></p>
<p>But if you don’t find the resolution stable for your device, you can also change this default resolution in simple steps. In the export window, follow the steps mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the preset tab, go to &gt; <strong>settings</strong>.</li>
<li>In the video tab, click on the <strong>resolution</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, select the resolution that you desire.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also select a custom resolution by these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, click on <strong>Custom</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can change the height and width according to your wish.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Part-1-Popular-text-effects-in-Filmora"><a href="#Part-1-Popular-text-effects-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Popular text effects in Filmora"></a>Part 1. Popular text effects in Filmora</h2><p>There are unlimited text effects available in Filmora but some of them are extremely popular that video creators regularly use in their videos. Here is the list of the popular Filmora video editor text effects that you should be aware of.</p>
<h3 id="1-Text-Swipe-Effect"><a href="#1-Text-Swipe-Effect" class="headerlink" title="1. Text Swipe Effect"></a>1. Text Swipe Effect</h3><p>Text swipe effects are the most commonly used in today’s videos on social media and video streaming platforms. In this effect, the text slides into the video frame from a particular direction. The entire text can swipe in if it is a one-liner and it can even swipe in word by word or sentence by sentence.</p>
<p>If you want to show short texts and you do not want to experiment with text animations, the text swipe effect is the safest option. For example, if you want to display your social media handles, your location, a coupon code, or a correction phrase that you have uttered wrongly, text swipe effects should be on your video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Type-Text-Effect"><a href="#2-Type-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="2. Type Text Effect"></a>2. Type Text Effect</h3><p>The type text effect in Filmora is referred to as the typewriter text effect in Premiere Pro and After Effects. The effect displays the text as if it is being typed in real-time as it is done in a typewriter. The characters will appear on the screen with a cursor on the screen and therefore, it takes more duration than most other text effects.</p>
<p>The type text effect is particularly useful when you are displaying a large size of text on the screen. It is also widely used when showing a paragraph of text instead of a simple line. This helps in drawing the attention of the audience to the paragraph and retaining the attention for a longer duration of time.</p>
<h3 id="3-WordArt-Effect"><a href="#3-WordArt-Effect" class="headerlink" title="3. WordArt Effect"></a>3. WordArt Effect</h3><p>WordArt is synonymous with MS Word where large words have 3D effects and highlighted background. Apart from 3D effect, text can have a thick stroke or outline as well as a gradient color style when WordArt effect is applied. In Filmora, you will find a plethora of WordArt effects and some are them are modern while others have a retro feel to them.</p>
<p>The WordArt effect is particularly popular while displaying titles and funny texts on the entire screen or covering a large part of the video. These are mostly used in the opening or ending scenes of the video. Besides, some video creators use them while making transitions from one scene to another.</p>
<h3 id="4-Keyframe"><a href="#4-Keyframe" class="headerlink" title="4. Keyframe"></a>4. Keyframe</h3><p>If you want to create text animations as per your requirements, you have to use keyframes in any video editor. You can always apply the ready-made video editing text effects but if you want to customize and personalize, you can add keyframes in between two timestamps. Thereafter, you need to change text styles and parameters for each frame so that it looks like an animation.</p>
<p>If you want to add uniqueness to text animations so that you can make the audience wonder and appreciate, keyframes are the way. Adding keyframes in the text layer on Filmora is super easy and you can get effects like texts slowly scaling up, dancing randomly, changing fonts, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="5-Color-Text-Effect"><a href="#5-Color-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="5. Color Text Effect"></a>5. Color Text Effect</h3><p>The color text effect is becoming extremely popular and it is widely used for opening and ending credits. Flashing different colors through your texts and titles against a darker background can act as a feast for the human eyes. There are different types of color text effects available that can make your text stand out.</p>
<p>When you are using color text effect, you need to maintain a large font size for your text so that it is widely visible. Even if your background is not dark, you can use a darker box in the background of the text or a darker frame around the text to amplify the effect.</p>
<h3 id="6-Bounce-to-Zoom-Effect"><a href="#6-Bounce-to-Zoom-Effect" class="headerlink" title="6. Bounce to Zoom Effect"></a>6. Bounce to Zoom Effect</h3><p>The bounce to zoom effect is widely used during a transition from one scene to another. It is regarded as a funny text effect where the text can swipe in and bounce and enlarge in size. Alternatively, the characters can bounce individually and zoom in and out with the motion as if they are dancing.</p>
<p>Apart from transitions, you can use the bounce to zoom effect to showcase a few important texts at the bottom of the video so that the viewers notice your text. Generally, the effect lasts for a few seconds before the text disappears. When you are using it for a larger text, you can use it for promotions and advertisements as well.</p>

If the player tries to steal from an NPC, the AI might make the NPC angry and more likely to attack the player. Alternatively, if the player is friendly to an NPC, the <strong>AI game playing</strong> might make the NPC more likely to help the player in future interactions.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-AI-in-Gaming-Matter"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-AI-in-Gaming-Matter" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?"></a>Part 2 <strong>Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?</strong></h2><p>One of the most vital aspects of <strong>AI in video games</strong> is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players. When games can convincingly simulate human-like behavior, it can be a much more enjoyable experience for gamers. AI can make NPCs seem more lifelike and make the game world feel more believable.</p>
<p>AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets. For example, a game might use procedural generation to create random dungeons or quests that the player can explore. This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.</p>

<p>The gaming world is ever-changing, with developers looking to create innovative ways to immerse players into their digital worlds. One such technology that has begun to sweep is <strong>AI in the game industry</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-AI-in-Gaming-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-AI-in-Gaming-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is AI in Gaming?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is AI in Gaming?</strong></h2><p>In simple terms, AI is a set of algorithms that allow a computer to learn and improve from experience. Although you can apply it in many ways, <strong>artificial intelligence in video games</strong> is usually helpful to create more intelligent and more believable non-player characters (NPCs).</p>
<p>For example, an AI system might be helpful to determine how an NPC reacts to the player’s actions. If the player tries to steal from an NPC, the AI might make the NPC angry and more likely to attack the player. Alternatively, if the player is friendly to an NPC, the <strong>AI game playing</strong> might make the NPC more likely to help the player in future interactions.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-AI-in-Gaming-Matter-2"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-AI-in-Gaming-Matter-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?"></a>Part 2 <strong>Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?</strong></h2><p>One of the most vital aspects of <strong>AI in video games</strong> is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players. When games can convincingly simulate human-like behavior, it can be a much more enjoyable experience for gamers. AI can make NPCs seem more lifelike and make the game world feel more believable.</p>
<p>AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets. For example, a game might use procedural generation to create random dungeons or quests that the player can explore. This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-AI-Will-Completely-Change-Video-Games-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-AI-Will-Completely-Change-Video-Games-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How AI Will Completely Change Video Games"></a>Part 3 <strong>How AI Will Completely Change Video Games</strong></h2><p>It is not a secret that AI is changing the world as we know it. With its ability to enable computers to learn and improve from experience, AI is paving the way for a future where machines can handle more complex tasks. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of video gaming.</p>
<p>In the past, developers brought in AI primarily for simple things like making certain NPCs (non-player characters) move and act realistically. But now, <strong>artificial intelligence in video games</strong> is being used for much more complex tasks like generating procedural content and creating believable human-like behavior. This results in a new generation of <strong>AI game playing</strong> that are more immersive and playable.</p>

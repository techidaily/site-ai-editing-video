<li><strong>Social interaction:</strong> Twitch offers a variety of features that allow gamers to connect with each other, including chat rooms, forums, and user-generated content.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You can save your stream on Twitch in two ways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>“Highlights”</strong> feature, which allows you to save specific moments from your live stream.</li>
<li>Download your stream’s entire <strong>VOD</strong> (video on demand) after it has ended.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Steps-1"><a href="#Steps-1" class="headerlink" title="Steps"></a>Steps</h3><p>Here are the quick steps to saving a stream on your PC from Twitch. But first, you need to enable Twitch VODs before starting your broadcast in the following way:</p>
<p>Step1 Visit <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.twitch.tv/"><strong>Twitch</strong></a> and sign in to your account. Now, click the <strong>“Profile”</strong> icons and go to <strong>“Creator Dashboard.”</strong></p>
<p>Step2 Head to <strong>Setting</strong> from the left-sidebar and click the <strong>“Stream”</strong> option. Scroll down and find the VOD Settings. Toggle the buttons next to <strong>“Store Past Broadcasts.”</strong></p>

                      alt="saving streams on twitch"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 To publish your VODs instantly after broadcasting, toggle the button next to <strong>“Always Publish VODs.”</strong></p>
<p>Now, to download the recordings of your broadcasts to your PC, do the following steps in sequence:</p>
<p>Step1 Head to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dashboard.twitch.tv/"><strong>Creator Dashboard,</strong></a> find the <strong>“Content”</strong> section in the left sidebar, and click <strong>“Video Producer.”</strong></p>
<p>Step2 Find the stream (VOD or Highlights) you want to download and on the right side, click the three dots.</p>
<p>Step3 Finally, click the <strong>“Download”</strong> option and let Twitch prepare your video. You will then get the stream’s recording in MP4 format.</p>

Use Screen Recorder To Record Your Streams"></a>Way 3. Use Screen Recorder To Record Your Streams</h2><p>Using a screen recorder is a great way to record your live stream because it lets you capture the full screen of your PC. Although there are many different screen recorders to choose from, we recommend using Filmora.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong></a> is a powerful editor with easy-to-use screen recording capabilities, giving you everything you need to <strong>record and stream your video at the same time.</strong> The software is free to use and has an intuitive interface.</p>
<h3 id="Features-of-Filmora"><a href="#Features-of-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Features of Filmora"></a>Features of Filmora</h3><ul>

<li>Ability to record your PC screen, audio, and webcam all at once</li>
<li>A variety of video editing features</li>
<li>An easy-to-use interface</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Steps-2"><a href="#Steps-2" class="headerlink" title="Steps"></a>Steps</h3><p>Here’s how to use Filmora for recording while streaming:</p>
<p>Step1 Head to the official <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>website, download the software and install it on your PC.</p>
<p>Step2 Launch <strong>Filmora 11</strong> and click <strong>“New project”</strong> in the main interface. Click <strong>“File”</strong> from the top toolbar and scroll down to <strong>“Record media</strong>.” From the drop-down menu, select <strong>“Record PC Screen.”</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/using-filmore-recorder-to-record-stream.png"
                      alt="using filmore recorder to record stream"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 A new <strong>“Wondershare Screen Recorder”</strong> window will pop up. You can set up a full screen, custom or target screen recording, speaker, and microphone settings. If you want more <strong>Settings,</strong> click the drop-down icon.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/filmora-recorder-window.png"
                      alt="filmora recorder window"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Click the <strong>Start</strong> icon to begin your recording. Afterward, click the <strong>Stop</strong> icon to stop the recording, and your stream will be saved in the selected destination.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve discussed three step-by-step methods to help you do <strong>live streaming and recording</strong> at the same time. With these solutions at your disposal, you’ll be able to save your VODs with ease.</p>
<p>It is best to choose only one software to start with to avoid the time-consuming trial-and-error process. If you want to add another tool, do so later; otherwise, you will waste your precious time and resources.</p>
<p>Give these methods a shot, and eventually, you will find your groove—and become accustomed to just how easy it is to record and stream a video simultaneously.</p>

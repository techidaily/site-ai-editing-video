And what’s the process that it takes us? How can we attract audiences and guarantee the viewers’ transition to loyalty? – these are the questions that people in the professions connected to the technology should ask. There is no recipe, but at least, we know what NOT to do – DO NOT create bad content! You will never have a desired amount of listeners for your podcasts if the voice of the actor or noise of the whole track is annoying, you will struggle to have success on Youtube if your shots are unpleasant to watch, and the list goes on – there are just too many things you should not do!</p>
<p>But sometimes bad quality just happens. It happens when you know you have a problem and it happens when you think everything is going well in producing. You might come back from the production and find out that every shot you took had bad lightning, or there was an almost naked guy running on the background, or there is a noise on the background that just makes the whole experience of watching and listening not worthwhile! This might be something that sinks your heart…</p>
<p>But the mistakes we make don’t ensure that there has been a verdict cast for our failure. Nowadays, the will is everything – if you are really willing to make something work, you will just have to find the right tools, and learn a little about them, and, Voila! – Maybe you can turn bad into something good? Unacceptable into something acceptable? Annoying into interesting, and unpleasant into enjoyable?</p>
<p>This is called EDITING. And Editing covers different, almost endless days – too many computer programs, too many tools, too many opportunities to modify almost anything you want to make look and sound better - All of this feels like magic!</p>
<p>Among many instruments and techniques, there is one thing called denoising, with two different meaning. You might find noise in two areas – video and audio. Audio denoising means to remove or reduce the background noise, such as air conditioner hum, someone screaming from far away, birds chirping, the waves, etc. the noise in photo and video terms means that the scene we are looking at is grainy and makes watching the scene a little more difficult, with a less clear picture. And whenever these kind of things appear, mostly out of the blue, – because no one wants to take a bad video or record a bad voice-over, - our magical tools and abilities come to play…</p>
<p>One of those is called Adobe Premiere Pro, using for video editing, viewed as the most sophisticated video editor software. So, in this article, we will learn how to handle bot noise-s – in video as well as audio terms, and how to create a better viewer&#x2F;listener experience in this very program. Lastly, we’ll touch upon an alternative for background noise removal, so, there’s nothing left but tuning in!</p>
<p><strong>Video denoising in Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></p>
<p>Reducing the noise in the video in this software can be achieved through using effect which is called Median. Before discovering it, without any doubt, we need to add our footage into the Timeline in Premiere Pro. Then, we can proceed to finding the Effects Panel, where our wanted Median can be found – just drag and drop the effect to your clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-1.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>In order to make sure that the Median touches the grainiest parts of the whole clip, we need to use something called masks. In the Effects Control panel, we can select the mask shape for our clip –either choose rectangle, circle, or pen tool. Pen tool is something with which we move the Mask around the screen and resize it to include the desired area and cover it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-2.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>Changing Feather setting to 100 will make sure that the effect loses a visible edge and there is some smoothness added to those edges.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-3.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>There might be the need to repeat this process and create several masks, if that means to have covered all of the grainy area of the scene.</p>
<p>Lastly, tom reduce the noise, adjusting the effect settings is needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-4.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>Technically, what the Median effect does is just blurring the graininess, not exactly “taking it away”. And if we play with the Radius settings there, we can find our desired look!</p>
<p><strong>How to remove background noise in Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></p>
<p>Removing background noise in Adobe Premiere Pro can be a pretty simple process and lead to much better results. First of all, of course, import the desired material into your software so you can see the video and audio in the sequence visually. After having the project set up, you will need to find the Efffects Panel, which might be hidden a little, but it must be on the left and bottom of the program layout; or, you can find it on the top, in the navbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-5.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>After having located the Effects panel, go for the search bar and type: denoise, and you’ll see that DeNoise effect is under Audio Effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-6.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>You hold onto the effect, drag and drop it on the audio track in the timeline itself! Then, you just click on the audio in the sequence and on the top right Effect Controls will appear, which we need to concentrate on. You will scroll down a little there and below Audio notice: fx DeNoise, where you hit on the Edit button. This will open the Clip Fx Editor for the Audio denoising.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-7.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>Basically, it only has one, Amount scale, and if you drag the slider of it to the right at 100%, it will remove the whole noise, but setting it on 0% will not remove any noise at all. So, you need to choose your preferred percentage! Just listen what is acceptable for you, but the general suggestion here would be that you can choose as high percent as you want, but if the effect starts taking out the voice and actually wanted parts, then you will have to stop and keep it that way. So, that’s actually it!</p>

<p>What we have promised in the beginning in the video, we like to offer now – the alternative to reduce or remove audio noise in the video is called Wondershare Filmora, which functions in a very simple way. So, we can start using these guides:</p>
<p>Drag and drop your video into the timeline. Right-clicking on the video and hitting Detach Audio will enable us to separate audio and video from one another, getting us a chance to work on them individually.</p>

                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the audio track shows the editing panel, where we see Remove background noise – choosing this option removes the noise!</p>

                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>Though, there is another way to do this too. If you don’t want to detach the audio, then first, double-click on the video clip in the timeline and when the editing panel opens, switch to Audio. If you check the box next to Remove background noise, you will see that there are three levels – weak, mid, and strong, which determine the strength of how toe noise is going to be reduced. Choosing one of them is up to you!</p>
<p>In case you find that the voice sounds a little robotics, you’ll need to make it sound more natural, of course. For it, you will need to click Customize, which will take you into the Customize Equalizer department.</p>

<p>The low tunes are on the left, while the highs are on the right. Background noises are often the low ones, so we better lower them even more, but we would raise the middle ones to achieve a natural sound.</p>

                ></p>
<p>And, that’s it – you are done with audio background noise removal!</p>
<p>So, in this article, we learned how to remove the video noise and grain and audio background noise using the software Adobe Premire Pro, while we also discussed how to do the latter using Wondershare Filmora – hope you can start using your new knowledge and tools very soon and create the content you never thought you could have created!</p>
<p>In order to make sure that the Median touches the grainiest parts of the whole clip, we need to use something called masks. In the Effects Control panel, we can select the mask shape for our clip –either choose rectangle, circle, or pen tool. Pen tool is something with which we move the Mask around the screen and resize it to include the desired area and cover it.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Changing Feather setting to 100 will make sure that the effect loses a visible edge and there is some smoothness added to those edges.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>There might be the need to repeat this process and create several masks, if that means to have covered all of the grainy area of the scene.</p>
<p>Lastly, tom reduce the noise, adjusting the effect settings is needed.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Technically, what the Median effect does is just blurring the graininess, not exactly “taking it away”. And if we play with the Radius settings there, we can find our desired look!</p>
<p><strong>How to remove background noise in Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></p>
<p>Removing background noise in Adobe Premiere Pro can be a pretty simple process and lead to much better results. First of all, of course, import the desired material into your software so you can see the video and audio in the sequence visually. After having the project set up, you will need to find the Efffects Panel, which might be hidden a little, but it must be on the left and bottom of the program layout; or, you can find it on the top, in the navbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>After having located the Effects panel, go for the search bar and type: denoise, and you’ll see that DeNoise effect is under Audio Effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>You hold onto the effect, drag and drop it on the audio track in the timeline itself! Then, you just click on the audio in the sequence and on the top right Effect Controls will appear, which we need to concentrate on. You will scroll down a little there and below Audio notice: fx DeNoise, where you hit on the Edit button. This will open the Clip Fx Editor for the Audio denoising.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Basically, it only has one, Amount scale, and if you drag the slider of it to the right at 100%, it will remove the whole noise, but setting it on 0% will not remove any noise at all. So, you need to choose your preferred percentage! Just listen what is acceptable for you, but the general suggestion here would be that you can choose as high percent as you want, but if the effect starts taking out the voice and actually wanted parts, then you will have to stop and keep it that way. So, that’s actually it!</p>

<p>You hold onto the effect, drag and drop it on the audio track in the timeline itself! Then, you just click on the audio in the sequence and on the top right Effect Controls will appear, which we need to concentrate on. You will scroll down a little there and below Audio notice: fx DeNoise, where you hit on the Edit button. This will open the Clip Fx Editor for the Audio denoising.</p>

<p>Basically, it only has one, Amount scale, and if you drag the slider of it to the right at 100%, it will remove the whole noise, but setting it on 0% will not remove any noise at all. So, you need to choose your preferred percentage! Just listen what is acceptable for you, but the general suggestion here would be that you can choose as high percent as you want, but if the effect starts taking out the voice and actually wanted parts, then you will have to stop and keep it that way. So, that’s actually it!</p>
<p><strong>Bonus tip: how to remove audio noise in video with Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>What we have promised in the beginning in the video, we like to offer now – the alternative to reduce or remove audio noise in the video is called Wondershare Filmora, which functions in a very simple way. So, we can start using these guides:</p>
<p>Drag and drop your video into the timeline. Right-clicking on the video and hitting Detach Audio will enable us to separate audio and video from one another, getting us a chance to work on them individually.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-8.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the audio track shows the editing panel, where we see Remove background noise – choosing this option removes the noise!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-9.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>Though, there is another way to do this too. If you don’t want to detach the audio, then first, double-click on the video clip in the timeline and when the editing panel opens, switch to Audio. If you check the box next to Remove background noise, you will see that there are three levels – weak, mid, and strong, which determine the strength of how toe noise is going to be reduced. Choosing one of them is up to you!</p>
<p>In case you find that the voice sounds a little robotics, you’ll need to make it sound more natural, of course. For it, you will need to click Customize, which will take you into the Customize Equalizer department.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>The low tunes are on the left, while the highs are on the right. Background noises are often the low ones, so we better lower them even more, but we would raise the middle ones to achieve a natural sound.</p>

Before you proceed to carve out your anime art, you will essentially require a comprehensive knowledge of the various aspects of the character you choose to draw. This includes the character’s anatomy, value, perspective and features, and a series of other details.</p>

<p>Anime drawings are a work of concentration and may take several hours or days to come out with perfection depending upon the complexity level.

It saves them from potential danger in production and helps them manage the time required to create a project. In this article, you will get pro tips and easy ways to add Fire effects by Wondershare Filmora.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> let’s not count Michael Bay and Christopher Nolan productions because their movies have a higher budget, and creating fake fire is easy.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-do-you-need-to-create-fire-effects"><a href="#Part-1-What-do-you-need-to-create-fire-effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What do you need to create fire effects?"></a>Part 1. What do you need to create fire effects?</h2><p>Using simple tools such as Filmora and visual effects, you can create a realistic fire effect with an easy setup. For filming the effect, we will need</p>
<ol>
<li>A good camera</li>
<li>A light source</li>
<li>Video editing software - Wondershare Filmora</li>
<li>Basic editing skills</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the light source is key to the fire effects. It will be beneficial if you have a <strong>warmer color</strong> light or a light that can change its temperature. You can use <strong>tungsten</strong> light bulbs or small circular <strong>LEDs</strong> that are pretty famous with Vloggers and tick-tock users.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-make-a-realistic-effect-fire"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-make-a-realistic-effect-fire" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to make a realistic effect fire?"></a>Part 2. How to make a realistic effect fire?</h2><p>After getting prepared, it’s time to do the real things. Follow the steps below to create a realistic fire effect like a pro.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Record-your-footage"><a href="#Step1-Record-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Record your footage"></a>Step1 Record your footage</h5><p>While recording the video, you can <strong>slightly shake</strong> your light source, which will give it the flickering effect of the flame. Here, you can do this in two ways.</p>
<p><strong>Shaking the light manually</strong></p>
<p>Just make sure when you are shaking the light, it is not shaken aggressively, or it will lose its realism to a real fire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="shaking the light source"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Shaking the light using a dimmer</strong></p>
<p>You can also use some skills to create the flickering effect of the fire without literally shaking the LED light. Dimmers come to help. A dimmer is a device that enables you to change the temperature of the LED light. If you have a <strong>dimmer</strong>, your work will be more accessible.</p>
<p>A <strong>regulator</strong> on the dimmer will help you switch between low and high tones. It will flicker the light on the object like a flame and make it look like it was placed in front of a real fire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="dimmer for shaking"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step2-Record-the-object"><a href="#Step2-Record-the-object" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Record the object"></a>Step2 Record the object</h5><p>Our next step will be to record the object on which the effect is taking place. Ensure the camera is placed under a <strong>good light</strong> source so that the picture is not dim and the object is exposed. Make sure the camera is placed at the <strong>level of the eye</strong> so that it will help you record your video clearly and accurately.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind to <strong>zoom out</strong> the camera lens, which will fix the frame of the video so that the object or the person is entirely on the screen. Another tip for creating a realistic fire effect would be the person acting as the object. The more natural the acting is, the more realistic would be the fire effect.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Edit-the-footage"><a href="#Step3-Edit-the-footage" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Edit the footage"></a>Step3 Edit the footage</h5><p>We are being safe and saving time by not using actual fire. The <strong>goal</strong> of creating a fake fire would be the effect and reaction of the object or the actor.</p>
<p><strong>1. Download a professional video editing software - Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Visit <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> official site if you haven’t already downloaded it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> download the latest version of filmora. It will give you a pro version and help you to create more realistic fire effects.</p>
<p><strong>2. Create a new project and import the recorded clips</strong></p>
<p>Before adding the fire effects to your video, you must ensure that you are familiar with the editing software. Your first step would be to add your clips to the <strong>timeline.</strong> Drag the footage from the library and enter it into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import footage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>3. create the fire effect more realistic by adding smoke</strong></p>
<p>The next step would be to add smoke to the fire. As it is only fair that the fire makes the smoke so. Adding the smoke will create the fire effect more realistic. Follow the below steps to get your cinematic video!</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Search-for-smoke-effects"><a href="#Step1-Search-for-smoke-effects" class="headerlink" title="#Step1 Search for smoke effects"></a>#Step1 Search for smoke effects</h5><p>To add the smoke effect, click on the element’s icon on the bar above and search for <strong>smokescreen 2.</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step2-Add-a-smoke-effect"><a href="#Step2-Add-a-smoke-effect" class="headerlink" title="#Step2 Add a smoke effect"></a>#Step2 Add a smoke effect</h5><p>Once you have searched and found the smoke screen 2 effects, then <strong>import</strong> that effect onto your timeline so that you can begin editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-4.gif"
                      alt="adding smokescreen2 effect"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’ve added the fire effect, you will notice the change on the screen in the top right corner.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-duration"><a href="#Step3-Add-duration" class="headerlink" title="#Step3 Add duration"></a>#Step3 Add duration</h5><p>The next step would be to set the duration of the smokescreen effect so that it <strong>matches the length of the video</strong>. To do so,</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the edge of the smoke screen effect.</li>
<li>Drag it to the right if the effect appears <strong>smaller</strong> than the video clip.</li>
<li>And drag it to the left if it is <strong>larger</strong> than the video clip.</li>
<li>As soon as it matches the length of the video, leave the drag, and it will fit right into place.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step4-Make-some-changes-to-the-smoke-effect"><a href="#Step4-Make-some-changes-to-the-smoke-effect" class="headerlink" title="#Step4 Make some changes to the smoke effect"></a>#Step4 Make some changes to the smoke effect</h5><p>Once you have matched the duration of the smoke screen effect to the video clip, our next step would be to make some changes. These changes will make the <strong>smokescreen appear more pleasing</strong>—<strong>double-click</strong> on the smokescreen effect, which will open the transform menu.</p>
<p>We would first focus on the transform panel. Here you would have many options, but our focus would be on <strong>rotation, scale, and position</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> make sure to rotate the smoke screen effect by simply sliding the slider or dragging the slider right or left to your desire.</p>
<ul>
<li>You would have created an <strong>angle</strong> of the smokescreen to make it more natural.</li>
<li>Now, we would have to adjust the <strong>scale</strong> of the smokescreen effect.</li>
<li>Drag the slider to the right to expand the smoke to spread on the screen. It will help the smoke screen do appear more natural.</li>
<li>You can adjust how much the smoke screen is visible on the screen by decreasing the opacity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adjust the slider to the <strong>left</strong> so it blends in with the flickering of the light we created. Now playback the video from the big screen to get an idea of the effect you added. And here are our parameters for reference.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the slider"
                ></p>
<p>Cool, isn’t it? Now we have added smoke to our timeline. Combined with the flickering light effect, we are closer to our goal.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-flames-or-sparks"><a href="#Step4-Add-flames-or-sparks" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add flames or sparks"></a>Step4 Add flames or sparks</h5><p>To mimic a real fire, we also have one more element that is missing, And that will be the <strong>sparks and the flames</strong>. And if you want to bring the fire effect of your video to the pro level, we would have to use the <strong>film stock effects.</strong> Flames and sparks are also available in the Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Search-for-Fire-Tab"><a href="#Step1-Search-for-Fire-Tab" class="headerlink" title="#Step1 Search for Fire Tab"></a>#Step1 Search for Fire Tab</h5><p><img

                      alt="search for fire tab"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>To do so, <strong>click</strong> on the bar above the element’s icon.</li>
<li>Once you have opened the elements tab, look to your <strong>left</strong> window, where further options are available.</li>
<li>From these options, click on the <strong>fire tab</strong>.</li>
<li>A new window will <strong>pop up</strong> in the library panel.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step2-Add-the-flame-to-the-timeline"><a href="#Step2-Add-the-flame-to-the-timeline" class="headerlink" title="#Step2 Add the flame to the timeline"></a>#Step2 Add the flame to the timeline</h5><p>Click on a large scale <strong>14</strong> and drag it into your timeline above the smoke effect and the clip.

<h5 id="Step3-Adjust-the-flame-effect"><a href="#Step3-Adjust-the-flame-effect" class="headerlink" title="#Step3 Adjust the flame effect"></a>#Step3 Adjust the flame effect</h5><p>Now, we have to do steps similar to the ones above the first job. But first, you have to click on the edges of the effect. Then, match it to the length of your video.</p>
<p>Now, remember if the length of the effect is <strong>more</strong> than that of the video clip. You can adjust it by clicking on the edge and dragging it to the <strong>left</strong>. And if it appears to be <strong>smaller</strong> than the video clip, drag the edge to the <strong>right</strong> to match the length.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Blend-the-video"><a href="#Step4-Blend-the-video" class="headerlink" title="#Step4 Blend the video"></a>#Step4 Blend the video</h5><p>When you look at the effect as you play the video from the start, you will notice that <strong>the effect is a little more intense</strong> than we want. To change it to your desires, you can follow the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First of all,</strong> double-click and open the <strong>transform</strong></li>
<li>Experiment with the <strong>rotation</strong> and the <strong>scale</strong> and position; make your choice.</li>
<li>Then move on to the compositing panel and focus on the <strong>blending mode</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you will notice a <strong>drop-down panel</strong> and select the screen option from all the other options.</li>
<li>Doing so would help you blend the spark effect video much better.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you focus on the spark effect that appears on the screen, you will notice that it seems to be much more intense than we require. If you want to blend it further, you can use <strong>the opacity adjuster</strong> and decrease the transparency. <strong>Then, adjust</strong> the slider till you feel it to be just right.</p>
<p>And the following are ideal parameters of our adjustment just for you to refer to.</p>

What do you need to create fire effects?"></a>Part 1. What do you need to create fire effects?</h2><p>Using simple tools such as Filmora and visual effects, you can create a realistic fire effect with an easy setup. For filming the effect, we will need</p>
<ol>
<li>A good camera</li>
<li>A light source</li>
<li>Video editing software - Wondershare Filmora</li>
<li>Basic editing skills</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the light source is key to the fire effects. It will be beneficial if you have a <strong>warmer color</strong> light or a light that can change its temperature. You can use <strong>tungsten</strong> light bulbs or small circular <strong>LEDs</strong> that are pretty famous with Vloggers and tick-tock users.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-make-a-realistic-effect-fire-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-make-a-realistic-effect-fire-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to make a realistic effect fire?"></a>Part 2. How to make a realistic effect fire?</h2><p>After getting prepared, it’s time to do the real things. Follow the steps below to create a realistic fire effect like a pro.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Record-your-footage-1"><a href="#Step1-Record-your-footage-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Record your footage"></a>Step1 Record your footage</h5><p>While recording the video, you can <strong>slightly shake</strong> your light source, which will give it the flickering effect of the flame. Here, you can do this in two ways.</p>
<p><strong>Shaking the light manually</strong></p>
<p>Just make sure when you are shaking the light, it is not shaken aggressively, or it will lose its realism to a real fire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-1.gif"
                      alt="shaking the light source"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Shaking the light using a dimmer</strong></p>
<p>You can also use some skills to create the flickering effect of the fire without literally shaking the LED light. Dimmers come to help. A dimmer is a device that enables you to change the temperature of the LED light. If you have a <strong>dimmer</strong>, your work will be more accessible.</p>
<p>A <strong>regulator</strong> on the dimmer will help you switch between low and high tones. It will flicker the light on the object like a flame and make it look like it was placed in front of a real fire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-2.jpg"
                      alt="dimmer for shaking"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step2-Record-the-object-1"><a href="#Step2-Record-the-object-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Record the object"></a>Step2 Record the object</h5><p>Our next step will be to record the object on which the effect is taking place. Ensure the camera is placed under a <strong>good light</strong> source so that the picture is not dim and the object is exposed. Make sure the camera is placed at the <strong>level of the eye</strong> so that it will help you record your video clearly and accurately.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind to <strong>zoom out</strong> the camera lens, which will fix the frame of the video so that the object or the person is entirely on the screen. Another tip for creating a realistic fire effect would be the person acting as the object. The more natural the acting is, the more realistic would be the fire effect.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Edit-the-footage-1"><a href="#Step3-Edit-the-footage-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Edit the footage"></a>Step3 Edit the footage</h5><p>We are being safe and saving time by not using actual fire. The <strong>goal</strong> of creating a fake fire would be the effect and reaction of the object or the actor.</p>
<p><strong>1. Download a professional video editing software - Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Visit <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> official site if you haven’t already downloaded it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> download the latest version of filmora. It will give you a pro version and help you to create more realistic fire effects.</p>
<p><strong>2. Create a new project and import the recorded clips</strong></p>
<p>Before adding the fire effects to your video, you must ensure that you are familiar with the editing software. Your first step would be to add your clips to the <strong>timeline.</strong> Drag the footage from the library and enter it into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-3.jpg"
                      alt="import footage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>3. create the fire effect more realistic by adding smoke</strong></p>
<p>The next step would be to add smoke to the fire. As it is only fair that the fire makes the smoke so. Adding the smoke will create the fire effect more realistic. Follow the below steps to get your cinematic video!</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Search-for-smoke-effects-1"><a href="#Step1-Search-for-smoke-effects-1" class="headerlink" title="#Step1 Search for smoke effects"></a>#Step1 Search for smoke effects</h5><p>To add the smoke effect, click on the element’s icon on the bar above and search for <strong>smokescreen 2.</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step2-Add-a-smoke-effect-1"><a href="#Step2-Add-a-smoke-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="#Step2 Add a smoke effect"></a>#Step2 Add a smoke effect</h5><p>Once you have searched and found the smoke screen 2 effects, then <strong>import</strong> that effect onto your timeline so that you can begin editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-4.gif"
                      alt="adding smokescreen2 effect"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’ve added the fire effect, you will notice the change on the screen in the top right corner.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-duration-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-duration-1" class="headerlink" title="#Step3 Add duration"></a>#Step3 Add duration</h5><p>The next step would be to set the duration of the smokescreen effect so that it <strong>matches the length of the video</strong>. To do so,</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the edge of the smoke screen effect.</li>
<li>Drag it to the right if the effect appears <strong>smaller</strong> than the video clip.</li>
<li>And drag it to the left if it is <strong>larger</strong> than the video clip.</li>
<li>As soon as it matches the length of the video, leave the drag, and it will fit right into place.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step4-Make-some-changes-to-the-smoke-effect-1"><a href="#Step4-Make-some-changes-to-the-smoke-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="#Step4 Make some changes to the smoke effect"></a>#Step4 Make some changes to the smoke effect</h5><p>Once you have matched the duration of the smoke screen effect to the video clip, our next step would be to make some changes. These changes will make the <strong>smokescreen appear more pleasing</strong>—<strong>double-click</strong> on the smokescreen effect, which will open the transform menu.</p>
<p>We would first focus on the transform panel. Here you would have many options, but our focus would be on <strong>rotation, scale, and position</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> make sure to rotate the smoke screen effect by simply sliding the slider or dragging the slider right or left to your desire.</p>
<ul>
<li>You would have created an <strong>angle</strong> of the smokescreen to make it more natural.</li>
<li>Now, we would have to adjust the <strong>scale</strong> of the smokescreen effect.</li>
<li>Drag the slider to the right to expand the smoke to spread on the screen. It will help the smoke screen do appear more natural.</li>
<li>You can adjust how much the smoke screen is visible on the screen by decreasing the opacity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adjust the slider to the <strong>left</strong> so it blends in with the flickering of the light we created. Now playback the video from the big screen to get an idea of the effect you added. And here are our parameters for reference.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the slider"
                ></p>
<p>Cool, isn’t it? Now we have added smoke to our timeline. Combined with the flickering light effect, we are closer to our goal.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-flames-or-sparks-1"><a href="#Step4-Add-flames-or-sparks-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add flames or sparks"></a>Step4 Add flames or sparks</h5><p>To mimic a real fire, we also have one more element that is missing, And that will be the <strong>sparks and the flames</strong>. And if you want to bring the fire effect of your video to the pro level, we would have to use the <strong>film stock effects.</strong> Flames and sparks are also available in the Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Search-for-Fire-Tab-1"><a href="#Step1-Search-for-Fire-Tab-1" class="headerlink" title="#Step1 Search for Fire Tab"></a>#Step1 Search for Fire Tab</h5><p><img

                      alt="search for fire tab"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>To do so, <strong>click</strong> on the bar above the element’s icon.</li>
<li>Once you have opened the elements tab, look to your <strong>left</strong> window, where further options are available.</li>
<li>From these options, click on the <strong>fire tab</strong>.</li>
<li>A new window will <strong>pop up</strong> in the library panel.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step2-Add-the-flame-to-the-timeline-1"><a href="#Step2-Add-the-flame-to-the-timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="#Step2 Add the flame to the timeline"></a>#Step2 Add the flame to the timeline</h5><p>Click on a large scale <strong>14</strong> and drag it into your timeline above the smoke effect and the clip. Doing so would have created <strong>two extra layers</strong> after the video tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Using the Memory Album</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to make a slideshow of the still memories of your recent vacation, or a cherished family event, you need to head to the left sidebar and click on the ‘For You’ tab.

<p>The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.</p>
<p>Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).</p>
<p>Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the top 8 best <strong>GIFs to APNG converters</strong> now.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Choose Files</p>
<p>Select several files on your computer using the “Choose Files” button or the dropdown menu to select an online file from a URL, Google Drive, or Dropbox. The file size of an image can be up to 200 megabytes. You can use a file analyzer to gain detailed information about a source image, including its size, resolution, quality, and transparent color.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Choose file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Choose Image Format</p>
<p>Determine the image format, quality, and size you want to use. You choose to use the original image size or select “Change width and height” and enter a custom image size. 1920x1080 is an example of a [width]x[height] format. Only a few image formats support the picture quality choice, such as JPG, WEBP, or AVIF. The value ranges from 1 (lowest picture quality and highest compression) to 100 (highest image quality and lowest compression) (best quality but least effective compression). If this field is left blank, the converter will use the estimated quality of your input image if found; otherwise, 92 by default. JPG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, HEIC, BMP, PS, PSD, WEBP, TGA, DDS, EXR, J2K, PNM, or SVG are examples of target image formats.</p>

It is a series of frames (a PNG image) that represent an animation sequence, producing a visual effect comparable to a GIF. APNG files support 24-bit pictures with 8-bit transparency.

<p>The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.</p>
<p>Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).</p>
<p>Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Choose Files</p>
<p>Select several files on your computer using the “Choose Files” button or the dropdown menu to select an online file from a URL, Google Drive, or Dropbox. The file size of an image can be up to 200 megabytes. You can use a file analyzer to gain detailed information about a source image, including its size, resolution, quality, and transparent color.</p>

                      alt="Choose file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Choose Image Format</p>
<p>Determine the image format, quality, and size you want to use. You choose to use the original image size or select “Change width and height” and enter a custom image size. 1920x1080 is an example of a [width]x[height] format. Only a few image formats support the picture quality choice, such as JPG, WEBP, or AVIF. The value ranges from 1 (lowest picture quality and highest compression) to 100 (highest image quality and lowest compression) (best quality but least effective compression). If this field is left blank, the converter will use the estimated quality of your input image if found; otherwise, 92 by default. JPG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, HEIC, BMP, PS, PSD, WEBP, TGA, DDS, EXR, J2K, PNM, or SVG are examples of target image formats.</p>

What Is APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics )</h3><p>The .apng (Animated Portable Network Graphics) extension is an unofficial extension to the Portable Network Graphics format (PNG ). It is a series of frames (a PNG image) that represent an animation sequence, producing a visual effect comparable to a GIF. APNG files support 24-bit pictures with 8-bit transparency. You can convert non-animated GIF files to APNG format. APNG files have the same.png extension as PNG files and can be opened by software like Mozilla Firefox, Chrome with APNG compatibility, and iOS 10’s iMessage apps.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Compress</strong></p>
<p>The compression rate is set to “Best” by default, but the Save Options box contains a few extras to check if you want a bit more control over the compression of your file. The file size will be determined by changing the compression rate; the higher the value, the less compression will be utilized when saving your image.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Open Paint</strong></p>
<p>Open an image-editing program on your computer, such as Paint for Windows or Paintbrush for Mac. Simply double-click the software’s icon on your desktop, or choose it from your applications list.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Go to saved Images</strong></p>
<p>Open the image you already saved. Navigate to the window where you saved the image. Click-hold it, drag it, and drop it onto the editor to display the image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Resize Image</strong></p>
<p>Make changes to the image. You can resize or rescale the image before saving it as a PNG file, and you can even add text using your software’s Text tool. This is, however, wholly optional.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Choose Save as</strong></p>
<p>PNG is the top format for saving images. Choose “Save as” from the “File” menu in the editor’s upper left corner.</p>
<p>In the File Name window, provide the name you want for the file.</p>
<p>Under the File Name field, click the “Save as type” drop-down option to see all of the image’s possible formats.</p>
<p>Click “Save” after selecting “PNG.” The file will be saved as a PNG file in the same directory as the original.</p>

<p>The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.</p>
<p>Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).</p>
<p>Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Choose Files</p>
<p>Select several files on your computer using the “Choose Files” button or the dropdown menu to select an online file from a URL, Google Drive, or Dropbox. The file size of an image can be up to 200 megabytes. You can use a file analyzer to gain detailed information about a source image, including its size, resolution, quality, and transparent color.</p>

                      alt="Choose file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Choose Image Format</p>
<p>Determine the image format, quality, and size you want to use. You choose to use the original image size or select “Change width and height” and enter a custom image size. 1920x1080 is an example of a [width]x[height] format. Only a few image formats support the picture quality choice, such as JPG, WEBP, or AVIF. The value ranges from 1 (lowest picture quality and highest compression) to 100 (highest image quality and lowest compression) (best quality but least effective compression). If this field is left blank, the converter will use the estimated quality of your input image if found; otherwise, 92 by default. JPG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, HEIC, BMP, PS, PSD, WEBP, TGA, DDS, EXR, J2K, PNM, or SVG are examples of target image formats.</p>

FAQ</h2><h3 id="1-What-Is-APNG-Animated-Portable-Network-Graphics-2"><a href="#1-What-Is-APNG-Animated-Portable-Network-Graphics-2" class="headerlink" title="1. What Is APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics )"></a>1. What Is APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics )</h3><p>The .apng (Animated Portable Network Graphics) extension is an unofficial extension to the Portable Network Graphics format (PNG ). It is a series of frames (a PNG image) that represent an animation sequence, producing a visual effect comparable to a GIF. APNG files support 24-bit pictures with 8-bit transparency. You can convert non-animated GIF files to APNG format. APNG files have the same.png extension as PNG files and can be opened by software like Mozilla Firefox, Chrome with APNG compatibility, and iOS 10’s iMessage apps.</p>

<p>Click File &gt; Open to bring up the photo you wish to convert to PNG.</p>

                      alt="Select image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Click Open</strong></p>
<p>Click “Open” when you’ve navigated to your picture.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-16_11h21_15.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1"
                      alt="Click Open"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Go to Save As</strong></p>
<p>After you’ve opened the file, go to File &gt; Save As.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-16_10h52_33.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1"
                      alt="Go to Save As"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save</strong></p>
<p>Make sure PNG is selected from the drop-down list of formats in the following box, then click “Save.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Save "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Compress</strong></p>
<p>The compression rate is set to “Best” by default, but the Save Options box contains a few extras to check if you want a bit more control over the compression of your file. The file size will be determined by changing the compression rate; the higher the value, the less compression will be utilized when saving your image.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Open Paint</strong></p>
<p>Open an image-editing program on your computer, such as Paint for Windows or Paintbrush for Mac. Simply double-click the software’s icon on your desktop, or choose it from your applications list.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Go to saved Images</strong></p>
<p>Open the image you already saved. Navigate to the window where you saved the image. Click-hold it, drag it, and drop it onto the editor to display the image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Resize Image</strong></p>
<p>Make changes to the image. You can resize or rescale the image before saving it as a PNG file, and you can even add text using your software’s Text tool. This is, however, wholly optional.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Choose Save as</strong></p>
<p>PNG is the top format for saving images. Choose “Save as” from the “File” menu in the editor’s upper left corner.</p>
<p>In the File Name window, provide the name you want for the file.</p>
<p>Under the File Name field, click the “Save as type” drop-down option to see all of the image’s possible formats.</p>
<p>Click “Save” after selecting “PNG.” The file will be saved as a PNG file in the same directory as the original.</p>

<p>The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.</p>
<p>Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).</p>
<p>Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Choose Files</p>
<p>Select several files on your computer using the “Choose Files” button or the dropdown menu to select an online file from a URL, Google Drive, or Dropbox. The file size of an image can be up to 200 megabytes. You can use a file analyzer to gain detailed information about a source image, including its size, resolution, quality, and transparent color.</p>

                      alt="Choose file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Choose Image Format</p>
<p>Determine the image format, quality, and size you want to use. You choose to use the original image size or select “Change width and height” and enter a custom image size. 1920x1080 is an example of a [width]x[height] format. Only a few image formats support the picture quality choice, such as JPG, WEBP, or AVIF. The value ranges from 1 (lowest picture quality and highest compression) to 100 (highest image quality and lowest compression) (best quality but least effective compression). If this field is left blank, the converter will use the estimated quality of your input image if found; otherwise, 92 by default. JPG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, HEIC, BMP, PS, PSD, WEBP, TGA, DDS, EXR, J2K, PNM, or SVG are examples of target image formats.</p>

Once you’ve opened GIPHY Capture - open up your browser, video, or whatever you want to record.

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-9.jpg"
                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.</p>
<p>You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.</p>
<p>You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.</p>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.</p>

<h3 id="GIFROCKET"><a href="#GIFROCKET" class="headerlink" title="GIFROCKET"></a><strong>GIFROCKET</strong></h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Mac</p>
<p>GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you’ve downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive interface</li>
<li>Change quality and file size of the outputted file</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.</li>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the <em>Settings</em> button. Here you’ll get three fields.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the <em>Hours</em>: <em>Minutes</em>: <em>Seconds</em> layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click <em>X</em>, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>PicGIF is yet another app for Mac users to express their contemporary entertainment in the form of a GIF. When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps’ commonly crappy and blurry gifs.</p>
<p>You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It’s a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.</p>

<li>Support a vast number of file formats</li>
<li>Support hundreds of image formats like JPEG, TIFF, BMP, PNG, TGA, RAW, PIC, etc., and any image size.</li>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The PicGIF software is safe to use</li>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Importing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.</p>

<h2 id="2-Customization-of-Pictures"><a href="#2-Customization-of-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="2. Customization of Pictures"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Customization of Pictures</strong></h2><p>Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.</p>
<p>Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.</p>

<li><strong>Customization of Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Gifox</strong></p>
<h3 id="1-Record-Your-Screen"><a href="#1-Record-Your-Screen" class="headerlink" title="1. Record Your Screen"></a>1. <strong>Record Your Screen</strong></h3><p>After clicking the fox icon in the menu bar, you can find the buttons to record the screen on the left side of the interface.</p>

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>Gifox provides two modes for recording the screen – area and window. This means you can record part of the window or choose to record the full window.</p>
<p>For an area recording, Gifox allows you the freedom to select the area. You can select any area by dragging your mouse from corner to corner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>When using the window recording mode, one great feature is that it doesn’t matter if several windows are overlapping. You can just select the one you want to record, and Gifox will ignore the other window.</p>
<p>Gifox also offers shortcuts so that you don’t have to always open the icon from the menu bar. This makes it even easier to use as a daily utility.</p>

<h3 id="3-Compress"><a href="#3-Compress" class="headerlink" title="3. Compress"></a>3. <strong>Compress</strong></h3><p>If you’re sharing a GIF on the internet, you’re going to like it to be of good quality but with the smallest file size possible. Gifox makes this possible. Available in preferences, the compress settings allow you to have full control over the quality of the GIF.

                ></p>
<p>After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.</p>
<p>You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.</p>
<p>You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.</p>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.</p>

<h3 id="GIFROCKET-1"><a href="#GIFROCKET-1" class="headerlink" title="GIFROCKET"></a><strong>GIFROCKET</strong></h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Mac</p>
<p>GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you’ve downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive interface</li>
<li>Change quality and file size of the outputted file</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the <em>Settings</em> button. Here you’ll get three fields.</li>
</ol>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the <em>Hours</em>: <em>Minutes</em>: <em>Seconds</em> layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click <em>X</em>, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.</p>

<p>PicGIF is yet another app for Mac users to express their contemporary entertainment in the form of a GIF. When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps’ commonly crappy and blurry gifs.</p>
<p>You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It’s a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.</p>
<h3 id="Features-1"><a href="#Features-1" class="headerlink" title="Features:"></a><strong>Features:</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Support a vast number of file formats</li>
<li>Support hundreds of image formats like JPEG, TIFF, BMP, PNG, TGA, RAW, PIC, etc., and any image size.</li>
<li>Support almost all common video formats: MOV, MPEG, MP4, M4V, 3GP, AVI, and more.</li>
<li>Support combining multiple formats – images, GIFs, and videos into a new single GIF.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The PicGIF software is safe to use</li>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Importing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.</p>

Customization of Pictures"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Customization of Pictures</strong></h2><p>Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.</p>
<p>Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Customization of Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Gifox</strong></p>
<h3 id="1-Record-Your-Screen-1"><a href="#1-Record-Your-Screen-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Record Your Screen"></a>1. <strong>Record Your Screen</strong></h3><p>After clicking the fox icon in the menu bar, you can find the buttons to record the screen on the left side of the interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-20.jpg"
                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>Gifox provides two modes for recording the screen – area and window. This means you can record part of the window or choose to record the full window.</p>
<p>For an area recording, Gifox allows you the freedom to select the area. You can select any area by dragging your mouse from corner to corner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>

<p>Gifox also offers shortcuts so that you don’t have to always open the icon from the menu bar. This makes it even easier to use as a daily utility.</p>

<p>After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.</p>
<p>You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.</p>
<p>You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.</p>

<li>After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the <em>Settings</em> button. Here you’ll get three fields.</li>
</ol>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the <em>Hours</em>: <em>Minutes</em>: <em>Seconds</em> layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click <em>X</em>, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>BEST PAID GIF MAKER ON MAC</strong></p>
<h3 id="PICGIF-2"><a href="#PICGIF-2" class="headerlink" title="PICGIF"></a><strong>PICGIF</strong></h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Mac</p>
<p>PicGIF is yet another app for Mac users to express their contemporary entertainment in the form of a GIF. When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps’ commonly crappy and blurry gifs.</p>
<p>You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It’s a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.</p>
<h3 id="Features-2"><a href="#Features-2" class="headerlink" title="Features:"></a><strong>Features:</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Support a vast number of file formats</li>
<li>Support hundreds of image formats like JPEG, TIFF, BMP, PNG, TGA, RAW, PIC, etc., and any image size.</li>
<li>Support almost all common video formats: MOV, MPEG, MP4, M4V, 3GP, AVI, and more.</li>
<li>Support combining multiple formats – images, GIFs, and videos into a new single GIF.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The PicGIF software is safe to use</li>
<li>The support of PicGIF is good</li>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Importing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.</p>

<h2 id="2-Customization-of-Pictures-2"><a href="#2-Customization-of-Pictures-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Customization of Pictures"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Customization of Pictures</strong></h2><p>Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.</p>
<p>Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.</p>

It only took seconds to create my GIF, but I only had six pictures and left it at the default size.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Customization of Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.</p>

<h3 id="1-Record-Your-Screen-2"><a href="#1-Record-Your-Screen-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Record Your Screen"></a>1. <strong>Record Your Screen</strong></h3><p>After clicking the fox icon in the menu bar, you can find the buttons to record the screen on the left side of the interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>Gifox provides two modes for recording the screen – area and window. This means you can record part of the window or choose to record the full window.</p>
<p>For an area recording, Gifox allows you the freedom to select the area. You can select any area by dragging your mouse from corner to corner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>When using the window recording mode, one great feature is that it doesn’t matter if several windows are overlapping. You can just select the one you want to record, and Gifox will ignore the other window.</p>
<p>Gifox also offers shortcuts so that you don’t have to always open the icon from the menu bar. This makes it even easier to use as a daily utility.</p>

<h3 id="3-Compress-2"><a href="#3-Compress-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Compress"></a>3. <strong>Compress</strong></h3><p>If you’re sharing a GIF on the internet, you’re going to like it to be of good quality but with the smallest file size possible. Gifox makes this possible. Available in preferences, the compress settings allow you to have full control over the quality of the GIF.

<p><strong>FAQS ABOUT MAKING GIFS FROM VIDEO</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What tip can I have in editing GIFs?</strong></li>

                ></p>
<p>After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.</p>
<p>You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.</p>
<p>You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.</p>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.</p>

<h3 id="GIFROCKET-3"><a href="#GIFROCKET-3" class="headerlink" title="GIFROCKET"></a><strong>GIFROCKET</strong></h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Mac</p>
<p>GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you’ve downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive interface</li>
<li>Change quality and file size of the outputted file</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the <em>Settings</em> button. Here you’ll get three fields.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the <em>Hours</em>: <em>Minutes</em>: <em>Seconds</em> layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click <em>X</em>, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.</p>

<p>PicGIF is yet another app for Mac users to express their contemporary entertainment in the form of a GIF. When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps’ commonly crappy and blurry gifs.</p>
<p>You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It’s a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Importing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.</p>

Customization of Pictures"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Customization of Pictures</strong></h2><p>Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.</p>
<p>Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Customization of Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Gifox</strong></p>
<h3 id="1-Record-Your-Screen-3"><a href="#1-Record-Your-Screen-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Record Your Screen"></a>1. <strong>Record Your Screen</strong></h3><p>After clicking the fox icon in the menu bar, you can find the buttons to record the screen on the left side of the interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-20.jpg"
                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>Gifox provides two modes for recording the screen – area and window. This means you can record part of the window or choose to record the full window.</p>
<p>For an area recording, Gifox allows you the freedom to select the area. You can select any area by dragging your mouse from corner to corner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-21.jpg"

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>When using the window recording mode, one great feature is that it doesn’t matter if several windows are overlapping. You can just select the one you want to record, and Gifox will ignore the other window.</p>
<p>Gifox also offers shortcuts so that you don’t have to always open the icon from the menu bar. This makes it even easier to use as a daily utility.</p>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<li>It has no merge feature: You can’t combine multiple audio files to make it one. Almost all major text-to-speech tools have a merge feature, but, Notevibes lags in this respect.</li>
<li>Voiceover &amp; Editor Page is different. There is one specific page for generating the voiceover and one page for downloading audio files. Switching between both of them will consume time. If you have a big project, switching between both pages will be tiring.</li>
<li>No Project-Based Structure: This is another feature that you need when you have big project. Keep multiple files in one place can create a mess. You can’t create any project inside Notevibes. This is a very immature structure.</li>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

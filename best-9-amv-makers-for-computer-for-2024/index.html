<h2 id="Part2-Know-your-target-audience"><a href="#Part2-Know-your-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="Part2. Know your target audience"></a>Part2. Know your target audience</h2><p>Before you create any ads, it’s important to define who will see them. You’ll want to think carefully about the type of person who would be interested in what you’re offering and how they would respond when they see the ad. If you can’t answer these questions, it’s time to start considering different audiences.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/know-your-target-audience.jpg"
                      alt="know your target audience"
                ></p>
<p>But how do we begin defining a target audience? To start, let’s look at the different terms used by advertisers:</p>
<p>Customer: The person who has already bought from your company. For example, if you sell coffee makers on Amazon and have an existing customer base from those sales (customers), then this would be the most relevant term for you when deciding who should see specific ads for new products or services that may interest them based on past purchases or interests shown through other online activity such as browsing history or social media engagement with similar content&#x2F;products&#x2F;services.</p>
<p>Prospect: A lead that has expressed interest in buying something, but has not yet purchased anything from your company. A prospect does not necessarily mean someone has signed up for an email list or asked for more info; keeping leads fresh is just as important as nurturing prospects into customers later down the road so don’t forget that part!</p>
<p>Now that you know who you are targeting, it’s time to create an avatar for your target customer. An avatar is a fictional character that represents your target customer. This will help you to better understand their needs and wants, and it will also make it easier to create targeted ads.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create an avatar for target customer"
                ></p>
<p>There are a few different ways to create an avatar:</p>
<p><em>1.) Customer profile:</em> This is a simple way to gather information about your target customer. Start by creating a list of demographic information such as age, location, gender, education level, and income level. You can also include interests and behaviors, such as what they like to do for fun, what type of music they listen to, and what type of products they buy.</p>
<p><em>2.) Persona:</em> A persona is very similar to a customer profile, but it takes things a step further by giving each target customer a name and backstory. This can be helpful if you are targeting a specific niche audience.</p>
<p><em>3.) Mind-map:</em> If you want to get creative, you can create a mind-map of your target customer. This will allow you to brainstorm everything that you know about them and come up with new ideas.</p>
<p>Once you have created your avatar, make sure that you keep it in mind when creating your Facebook ad campaign. This will help to ensure that your ads are relevant and interesting to your target customer.</p>

Prepare a decent image for your audience to click on"></a>Part3. Prepare a decent image for your audience to click on</h2><p>Images are the most important part of any ad. A good image will help your customers understand what it is that they’re clicking on, and they may even want to share it with their friends. However, if your image is poor quality or irrelevant then, it won’t do as well as it could have done.</p>
<p>You should start by picking a relevant image that shows off your product in the best light possible. If possible, try and get some type of testimonial from customers using your product so that other people can see how great your product really is!</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you don’t have good images available yet, don’t worry! You can always hire a professional photographer who knows what kind of shots work best for advertising purposes but even if this isn’t something that suits every business, there are still plenty of free resources out there too like Unsplash which offers high-quality stock photography under Creative Commons licenses under various conditions such as attribution when used commercially, so make sure whatever method you choose fits within these guidelines!</p>
<h2 id="Part4-Practice-Your-copywriting-skills"><a href="#Part4-Practice-Your-copywriting-skills" class="headerlink" title="Part4. Practice Your copywriting skills"></a>Part4. Practice Your copywriting skills</h2><p>You can have the best-developed ad in the world, but if it doesn’t have strong copywriting, your ads won’t work as well. It’s important to know what you’re getting into before spending time and money on Facebook ads.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="practice copywriting skills fb ads"
                ></p>
<p>The following are just some of the ways you can improve your copywriting skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read other people’s ads and see how they write their copy</li>
<li>Read books about writing persuasive copy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try writing your own copy. Then have someone read it and give feedback on what they like and what they don’t like about it. Try to learn from their suggestions.</p>
<p>There are also many different ways to write copy for a Facebook ad. Some people like to use specific formulas for their ads, such as: AIDA (attention, interest, desire, action). This formula was developed by an American businessman named Claude C. Hopkins in 1898 and is still widely used today. If you’re not sure which method is best for you, it might be worth trying a few different ones. Have someone read your ad and give their opinion on which method was the most effective at convincing them that they should click on your ad.</p>
<p>You can also hire a copywriter to help you with your ad. However, if you don’t have the budget for it at this point in time or just want to try writing your own first before hiring someone else, there are many different apps and websites that will help you to create an ad copy.</p>
<h2 id="Part5-Decide-what-type-of-ad-format-will-you-use"><a href="#Part5-Decide-what-type-of-ad-format-will-you-use" class="headerlink" title="Part5. Decide what type of ad format will you use"></a>Part5. Decide what type of ad format will you use</h2><p>It is a carousel ad, or single image&#x2F;video ad, or a combination of both?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/choose-ad-type-format.jpg"
                      alt="choose ad type format"
                ></p>
<p>If you are going to use a carousel ad, you need at least three images. If you’re using a single image or video ads, then you only need one image or video.</p>
<p>As always, if your budget allows it, try to increase the number of ad sets that are running at once so as not to cannibalize each other’s reach—it’s better to have multiple ads winning than just one.</p>
<p>If you’re running a single video ad for example and your budget is $100 per day, it’s best practice to have to create multiple versions of this single video ad so that they don’t cannibalize each other.</p>
<h2 id="Part6-Plan-your-ad-budget"><a href="#Part6-Plan-your-ad-budget" class="headerlink" title="Part6. Plan your ad budget"></a>Part6. Plan your ad budget</h2><p>You need to determine how much you’re willing to spend on your Facebook ads. This will help you to create a budget and also to decide how often you want your ad to be shown.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="plan your fb ad budget"
                ></p>
<p>The average Facebook ad spends between $5 and $10 per day. However, this can vary depending on the type of product or service that you’re promoting, as well as the size of your target audience.</p>
<p>If you have a large target audience, it might be worth increasing your ad budget so that your ad is seen by more people. On the other hand, if you have a smaller target audience, you might want to decrease your ad budget so that you don’t spend too much money on ads that aren’t being seen by as many people.</p>
<p>It’s also important to consider how often you want your ad to be shown. If you want your ad to be seen by as many people as possible, it’s best to have it shown more than once. However, if you only want your ad to be shown to a select group of people, it’s best to have it shown less often.</p>
<p>Both of these factors will help you to determine your Facebook ad spend.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>If you’re ready to get started with Facebook ads, we encourage you to put these tips into practice. I believe that they will help you make the most of your budget and achieve your goals, whether they be brand awareness, lead generation or sales.</p>

On a video, you can utilize this feature to freeze a specific reaction of the character on screen or add a dramatic effect for a pivotal moment, like scoring a touchdown.</p>
<p>Upon enabling this effect, the video clip automatically splits at the frozen moments. Users insert another image file for that duration and activate the background audio and effects. If you are wondering how to carry out this feature on Filmora, read all the steps involved here.</p>

<p>Still, it would help if you tapped the play button on the screen to see a Preview of the video clip to check its stability and quality. Also, ensure that your main subject is darker than the backdrop in the video clip.</p>
<h2 id="Adjust-the-playhead-location"><a href="#Adjust-the-playhead-location" class="headerlink" title="Adjust the playhead location"></a>Adjust the playhead location</h2><p>On the video clip, you added to the editing timeline, click on the playhead.

Make sure to place the image where the playhead is, marking the point of the freeze frame. Then, drag the slider at the end of the image clip you added to the timeline to match its length with the video clip.</p>
<p>Afterward, you should click on the playhead and move it a little ahead by a few frames. Again, tap the “Lock Track” icon beside the image file to keep it in place. Following that, take another snapshot of the image via the Snapshot icon.</p>

<h2 id="Adding-the-footage-1"><a href="#Adding-the-footage-1" class="headerlink" title="Adding the footage"></a>Adding the footage</h2><p>Next, your main step is to add the video you will edit into the Filmora software. First, you must click the Create New Project tab on the homepage. When the editor opens, tap on the “Click here to import media” button and insert the video you will edit from your device. Next, drag it down to the editing timeline for making further changes. Choose the Keep project settings option when the prompt comes up to ensure the same quality of the video.</p>

                      alt="insert the video"
                ></p>
<p>Still, it would help if you tapped the play button on the screen to see a Preview of the video clip to check its stability and quality. Also, ensure that your main subject is darker than the backdrop in the video clip.</p>
<h2 id="Adjust-the-playhead-location-1"><a href="#Adjust-the-playhead-location-1" class="headerlink" title="Adjust the playhead location"></a>Adjust the playhead location</h2><p>On the video clip, you added to the editing timeline, click on the playhead. Then, drag it to move it to the specific point in the video where you will freeze the frame. Click on the Snapshot icon at the right end of the preview window to capture the frame. Press the Lock Track icon after that.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click the snapshot icon"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Move-the-image-in-place-1"><a href="#Move-the-image-in-place-1" class="headerlink" title="Move the image in place"></a>Move the image in place</h2><p>After the previously mentioned step, you should drag the snapshot you just captured to the second layer on the timeline above the clip. Make sure to place the image where the playhead is, marking the point of the freeze frame. Then, drag the slider at the end of the image clip you added to the timeline to match its length with the video clip.</p>
<p>Afterward, you should click on the playhead and move it a little ahead by a few frames. Again, tap the “Lock Track” icon beside the image file to keep it in place. Following that, take another snapshot of the image via the Snapshot icon.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="tap the lock track icon"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Unlock-the-layers-1"><a href="#Unlock-the-layers-1" class="headerlink" title="Unlock the layers"></a>Unlock the layers</h2><p>Repeat this step for a few more layers, like dragging the snapshot image to the timeline &gt; moving the playhead by some frames &gt; Snapshot &gt; Lock Track. Then, after you are done with the number of stages possible with your video clip, unlock all of the locked track layers sequentially from top to bottom.</p>
<h2 id="Editing-the-layers-1"><a href="#Editing-the-layers-1" class="headerlink" title="Editing the layers"></a>Editing the layers</h2><p>After this, click on the second clip in the layers. Right-click on the top of the clip in the timeline and choose “Edit Properties” from the drop-down menu. Next, click on the Compositing option and tap the tickmark beside it. Then, select the drop-down menu for the Blending Mode option and change Normal to Darken. Press the OK button after you are done.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="change normal to darken"
                ></p>
<p>Following that, repeat the same for all of the layers of the snapshots to choose the blending mode parameter for them to Darken. After you are done, click on the Preview play button to see how the process worked for creating the freeze frame effect in your video clip.</p>
<h2 id="Exporting-the-effect-the-first-time-1"><a href="#Exporting-the-effect-the-first-time-1" class="headerlink" title="Exporting the effect the first time"></a>Exporting the effect the first time</h2><p>After completing all the editing steps, you should select the Export button at the top of the screen. Then, choose the Local tab and click on the MP4 as the video file format. Make settings-based changes if needed and press the Export button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="press the export button"
                ></p>
<p>After that, however, import the edited file to Filmora from your device again.</p>
<h2 id="Edit-the-freeze-frame-video-clip-1"><a href="#Edit-the-freeze-frame-video-clip-1" class="headerlink" title="Edit the freeze frame video clip"></a>Edit the freeze frame video clip</h2><p>Choose all of the video clip sections you edited on Filmora from the timeline after adding the recently edited video clip to the editor. Then, drag this clip to the primary editing timeline layer on the timeline and drop it.</p>
<p>Then, drag the playhead on the clip to the frame at which the third freeze frame occurs. For this, you can play the Preview of the clip to verify. After placing the playhead at that exact moment, click on the Split icon from the toolbar above the editor timeline or the Scissor icon. Then, remove the second half of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

From the drop-down menu that appears, tap on the Copy option. Then, paste the second half beside the first half on the same layer.</p>
<p>After that, right-click on the second copied clip and choose the Speed option &gt; Click on Reverse. After that, play the Preview to see how the effect appears in your video. Finally, export the video from Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The process of creating a freeze-frame effect can typically get complex. But it is relatively simple to achieve on Filmora if you follow the steps diligently. Furthermore, on this software, whether you are using a Windows or Mac device, there are various video editing features, including the freeze-frame effect.

<h2 id="The-6-Key-Features-of-Flixpress"><a href="#The-6-Key-Features-of-Flixpress" class="headerlink" title="The 6 Key Features of Flixpress"></a>The 6 Key Features of Flixpress</h2><p>Listed below are the features that make Flixpress stand out among the competitors.</p>
<h3 id="1-HD-Downloads"><a href="#1-HD-Downloads" class="headerlink" title="1. HD Downloads"></a>1. HD Downloads</h3><p>It is an established fact that the quality of the video is the first factor for the audience to judge, and having a bad quality video uploaded to a YouTube channel that you wish to grow is not really a wise choice.</p>
<p>Flixpress offers you high-definition downloads that are perfect for viewing your video on the web and broadcasting it on television.</p>
<h3 id="2-Customizable-Templates"><a href="#2-Customizable-Templates" class="headerlink" title="2. Customizable Templates"></a>2. Customizable Templates</h3><p>Having templates that can be customized as per your needs really makes the task easier. Flixpress offers a variety of templates that give you the option to enter text in some fields. This text is then beautifully rendered out in the final edited video.</p>
<h3 id="3-Audio-Tools"><a href="#3-Audio-Tools" class="headerlink" title="3. Audio Tools"></a>3. Audio Tools</h3><p>Adding the right audio can leave a significant impact on the overall aesthetic and impression of the video. It is perhaps one of the prime factors that decides whether the audio is edited well or not.</p>
<p>That said, Flixpress allows you to incorporate any custom audio file into the video. You will just be required to upload that audio in mp3 format, and that’s all. Other than that, you can add several sound elements as well.</p>
<h3 id="4-Multiple-Formats"><a href="#4-Multiple-Formats" class="headerlink" title="4. Multiple Formats"></a>4.

However, along with the MOV format, you also have the option to export the video in the standard MP4 format or a WMV format as well.</p>
<h3 id="5-Stock-Video-Library"><a href="#5-Stock-Video-Library" class="headerlink" title="5. Stock Video Library"></a>5. Stock Video Library</h3><p>Yes, you read that right.

Unfortunately, some social media platforms like Instagram require your video to be short. Therefore, many people wonder how to cut a video to make it easier to share. If you’re wondering how to cut video for Instagram on Mac, you’re in luck. This article shares the best tools to use for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>What You Should Know About Instagram Video</strong></p>

<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video.

Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid Instagram Video Cutter?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How do you post long videos on Instagram without splitting?</strong> Instagram allows users to post long videos on the app, as long as 60 seconds. Alternatively, you can use the IGTV to upload long clips on Instagram without splitting.</li>
<li><strong>What is multi-capture on Instagram:</strong> This tool allows you to create and share multiple photos on your stories.</li>
<li><strong>How do I split the video into two parts for Instagram on Mac?</strong> The paid and free video cutters shared above will help you split a video into two parts for Instagram on Mac. Simply pick the option that fits your preference.</li>
<li><strong>Why can’t I split a video on iMovie?</strong> Maybe your iMovie software is experiencing a glitch; you can simply restart the software. Alternately, move the clip to the center row if you find the option greyed out. Moving the clip should help fix the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video. When deciding which is the best option for you, free or paid, the factors listed will help you decide. Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p>GIFs have been around for quite some time but as the flow of content continues to plummet on popular social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, the demand for GIFs would continue to increase.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you won’t be able to <strong>make a gif in after effects</strong> directly, unless with the help of a plug-in like GIFGun.</p>
<p>Before moving forward, keep in mind that using Adobe Media Encoder is an easier method for compressing your exports rather than any third-party compressor.</p>
<p>In this article, you will find easy to follow methods using which you can create <strong>after effects GIFs</strong> within a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>This format was incredibly successful on the WEB due to benefits like smaller file sizes, broader support, and its easy compatibility with Operating Systems.</p>
<p>However, GIFs are much more suitable as simple graphics and logos rather than Live Action Videos with its palette limitation of 256 per image.</p>
<p>Creating a GIF is like looping an animation or animated elements. You can use these animated GIFs in banners to engage your audience or even create fun sharable content for your Facebook pages.</p>
<p>You can start by creating basic easy animations in Photoshop and then elevate them by using After Effects.</p>

<p>Now, for those who are learning Photoshop and After Effects for the first time, to understand the difference in results between both these software lets familiarize you with their features in brief.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-Similar"><a href="#01What’s-Similar" class="headerlink" title="01What’s Similar?"></a>01What’s Similar?</h3><p>Since both are designed by Adobe, there are bound to be similarities in the tools and interface they use. Both these software enables you to use layers of editing from the layer panel where you separate the blending or transform multiple layers. You can apply masks to these layers in different ways on both software.</p>
<h3 id="02Groups-PS-and-Nested-AE-Composition"><a href="#02Groups-PS-and-Nested-AE-Composition" class="headerlink" title="02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition"></a>02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition</h3><p>In Photoshop, you can group layers together and apply styles, blends, and transformations together. However, in After Effects, this is called Nesting.</p>
<p>Both are in a way similar to each other but Nesting Comps give users more functionality as it interprets probable compositions during the nesting process.</p>
<p>Smart objects used in PS are also comparable to Nested Comps as you can apply filters over one while applying effects to the other.</p>
<h3 id="03Vector-and-Shapes"><a href="#03Vector-and-Shapes" class="headerlink" title="03Vector and Shapes"></a>03Vector and Shapes</h3><p>You can use the Pen tool or Shape tool in both PS and AE that creates shape layers without losing any integrity. Both the applications support Bezier which lets you control curves between anchor points in PS and vertices in AE.</p>
<h3 id="04Destructive-Effects"><a href="#04Destructive-Effects" class="headerlink" title="04Destructive Effects"></a>04Destructive Effects</h3><p>After Effects does not provide you with destructive effects while in Photoshop you can apply non-destructive filters. You can also combine several layers to apply changes or distort your images but these permanent changes cannot be made in After Effects.</p>
<p>You will also notice that although there are several similarities, there are tools and features which are not shared between both applications. The types of tool categories would also vary. Like with After Effects, you can create paragraph and character styles that you can apply to texts.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-After-Effects-Gifs"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-After-Effects-Gifs" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs"></a>Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs</h2><p>After Effects harbors greater video editing capabilities rather than the basic animating options you can try on Photoshop. In creating a GIF, you would want to leverage the combination of tools offered on both After Effects and Photoshop.</p>
<p>Let’s first get into how you can create an animated video on After Effects and then convert it into an animated GIF in Photoshop.</p>
<h3 id="01Animating-in-After-Effects"><a href="#01Animating-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="01Animating in After Effects"></a>01Animating in After Effects</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open After Effects, go to ‘Composition’ and create ‘New Composition’. You will need to fill out the dimensions and specs for your project on the window that pops up. For example, 300x250 px at 30 fps and 6 sec duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-1.jpg"
                      alt="new composition after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can import assets by dragging and dropping, or by going to the ‘Project Panel’ in the After Effects Workspace as shown in the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-2.jpg"
                      alt="project panel after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, you can begin animating your Assets. Drag them and add them to the ‘Composition’ panel or ‘Timeline’ panel. Placing them in either one will make them appear on both. Adjust the layers according to the topmost layer on the panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-3.jpg"
                      alt="timeline panel"
                ></p>
<p>Dial down the scale of every animation to 0% so that can be animated in a growing sequence. Select the layer you wish to adjust and click on ‘Transform’. Click on ‘Scale’ to give that layer an active marker on the timeline. Set the scale to 0%.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-4.jpg"
                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>You can now begin animating the first item by moving the current time indicator to 06f (the 6th frame on the 30fps timeline). Scale the item back to 100% and the marker will reappear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-5.jpg"
                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>Repeat this for the other items. Keep in mind that each item has a 06f space between them for later adjustability.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-6.jpg"
                      alt="repeat process"
                ></p>
<p>Your equation is now complete and all that is left to do is animate your CTA button. Adjust the position of the top layer on your CTA and set the current time indicator to start time on the button animation. Click on ‘position’ to set up a marker on your Timeline. Forward the 04f then nudge the button and reverse back to the original position so that it looks like a button clicking animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="set position"
                ></p>
<p>Your animation is now complete. Now go to ‘Composition’ and shorten the time in the ‘Duration’ panel.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go to Composition. Click on Pre-Render and a new selection will pop up. Now click on ‘Render’. Your output will be a .mov file.</p>

<h3 id="02Converting-Animation-to-GIF-in-Photoshop"><a href="#02Converting-Animation-to-GIF-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="02Converting Animation to GIF in Photoshop"></a>02Converting Animation to GIF in Photoshop</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a new file in Photoshop with the same specs as you did in After Effects. Now go to ‘File’ &gt; ‘Import’ &gt; ‘Frames to Layers’ and import the saved .mov file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import file photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you don’t automatically see the timeline, go to Windows &gt; Timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="timeline photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Decide on how many loops you want in your animation. Once you are done with your GIF, go to ‘File’ &gt; Export. Apply the Legacy Save for Web and choose the format for your GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-11.jpg"
                      alt="export and save as gif photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In Export options, you can gain access to several presets to apply to your animated GIFs. The more color displayed in your GIF, the larger its size. You can use Dethering to smoothen gradients and shades. Looping is also turned off on Photoshop but you can apply looping from the ‘Options’ shown at the bottom of the menu.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Ending-Thoughts"><a href="#Part-1-Ending-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Ending Thoughts"></a>Part 1 Ending Thoughts</h2><p><strong>●</strong> GIFs are a popular type of media that is quite trendy and easy to make using Adobe <strong>after effects gifs</strong> or Photoshop. They are called Graphics Interchange Format and are best used as simple graphic images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You require a combination of both Photoshop and After Effects, though both share similar interfaces, tools, and effects. You can group or nest compositions, apply filters or effects, and adjust vectors and shapes.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> After Effects is better than Photoshop in terms of creating videos, so you can first create a project in AE and then import the project onto PS after <strong>exporting after effects to gif</strong>. You can also use Filmora for the first step of this process.</p>

<p><img

                      alt="project panel after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, you can begin animating your Assets. Drag them and add them to the ‘Composition’ panel or ‘Timeline’ panel. Placing them in either one will make them appear on both. Adjust the layers according to the topmost layer on the panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="timeline panel"
                ></p>
<p>Dial down the scale of every animation to 0% so that can be animated in a growing sequence. Select the layer you wish to adjust and click on ‘Transform’. Click on ‘Scale’ to give that layer an active marker on the timeline. Set the scale to 0%.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>You can now begin animating the first item by moving the current time indicator to 06f (the 6th frame on the 30fps timeline). Scale the item back to 100% and the marker will reappear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>Repeat this for the other items. Keep in mind that each item has a 06f space between them for later adjustability.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="repeat process"
                ></p>
<p>Your equation is now complete and all that is left to do is animate your CTA button. Adjust the position of the top layer on your CTA and set the current time indicator to start time on the button animation. Click on ‘position’ to set up a marker on your Timeline. Forward the 04f then nudge the button and reverse back to the original position so that it looks like a button clicking animation.</p>

                      alt="set position"
                ></p>
<p>Your animation is now complete. Now go to ‘Composition’ and shorten the time in the ‘Duration’ panel.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go to Composition. Click on Pre-Render and a new selection will pop up. Now click on ‘Render’. Your output will be a .mov file.</p>

Now go to ‘File’ &gt; ‘Import’ &gt; ‘Frames to Layers’ and import the saved .mov file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="import file photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you don’t automatically see the timeline, go to Windows &gt; Timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="timeline photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Decide on how many loops you want in your animation. Once you are done with your GIF, go to ‘File’ &gt; Export. Apply the Legacy Save for Web and choose the format for your GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="export and save as gif photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In Export options, you can gain access to several presets to apply to your animated GIFs. The more color displayed in your GIF, the larger its size. You can use Dethering to smoothen gradients and shades. Looping is also turned off on Photoshop but you can apply looping from the ‘Options’ shown at the bottom of the menu.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Ending-Thoughts-1"><a href="#Part-1-Ending-Thoughts-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Ending Thoughts"></a>Part 1 Ending Thoughts</h2><p><strong>●</strong> GIFs are a popular type of media that is quite trendy and easy to make using Adobe <strong>after effects gifs</strong> or Photoshop. They are called Graphics Interchange Format and are best used as simple graphic images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You require a combination of both Photoshop and After Effects, though both share similar interfaces, tools, and effects. You can group or nest compositions, apply filters or effects, and adjust vectors and shapes.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> After Effects is better than Photoshop in terms of creating videos, so you can first create a project in AE and then import the project onto PS after <strong>exporting after effects to gif</strong>. You can also use Filmora for the first step of this process.</p>

<p>GIFs have been around for quite some time but as the flow of content continues to plummet on popular social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, the demand for GIFs would continue to increase.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you won’t be able to <strong>make a gif in after effects</strong> directly, unless with the help of a plug-in like GIFGun.</p>
<p>Before moving forward, keep in mind that using Adobe Media Encoder is an easier method for compressing your exports rather than any third-party compressor.</p>
<p>In this article, you will find easy to follow methods using which you can create <strong>after effects GIFs</strong> within a matter of minutes.</p>

This was developed back in 1987 by a working in CompuServe.</p>
<p>This format was incredibly successful on the WEB due to benefits like smaller file sizes, broader support, and its easy compatibility with Operating Systems.</p>
<p>However, GIFs are much more suitable as simple graphics and logos rather than Live Action Videos with its palette limitation of 256 per image.</p>
<p>Creating a GIF is like looping an animation or animated elements. You can use these animated GIFs in banners to engage your audience or even create fun sharable content for your Facebook pages.</p>
<p>You can start by creating basic easy animations in Photoshop and then elevate them by using After Effects.</p>
<h3 id="02Why-create-a-GIF-2"><a href="#02Why-create-a-GIF-2" class="headerlink" title="02Why create a GIF?"></a>02Why create a GIF?</h3><p>Here are a handful of things you can keep your eye on if you are just starting on making GIFs;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simple Product Demonstrations. With simple 3 to 4 step GIFs, you can briefly introduce steps on how to use a product.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can provide instructions in a short span of time.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> UX designers use GIFs to show the functioning of certain digital experiences.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can introduce GIFs on your page to keep followers engaged.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can display some amazing things on your website.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Difference-between-making-GIFs-in-After-Effects-and-Photoshop-2"><a href="#Part-2-Difference-between-making-GIFs-in-After-Effects-and-Photoshop-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Difference between making GIFs in After Effects and Photoshop"></a>Part 2 Difference between making GIFs in After Effects and Photoshop</h2><p>Creating GIFs in After Effects and Photoshop are both one in the same thing but the results may vary depending on which choice of tools and features suits you better.</p>
<p>Now, for those who are learning Photoshop and After Effects for the first time, to understand the difference in results between both these software lets familiarize you with their features in brief.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-Similar-2"><a href="#01What’s-Similar-2" class="headerlink" title="01What’s Similar?"></a>01What’s Similar?</h3><p>Since both are designed by Adobe, there are bound to be similarities in the tools and interface they use. Both these software enables you to use layers of editing from the layer panel where you separate the blending or transform multiple layers. You can apply masks to these layers in different ways on both software.</p>
<h3 id="02Groups-PS-and-Nested-AE-Composition-2"><a href="#02Groups-PS-and-Nested-AE-Composition-2" class="headerlink" title="02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition"></a>02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition</h3><p>In Photoshop, you can group layers together and apply styles, blends, and transformations together. However, in After Effects, this is called Nesting.</p>
<p>Both are in a way similar to each other but Nesting Comps give users more functionality as it interprets probable compositions during the nesting process.</p>
<p>Smart objects used in PS are also comparable to Nested Comps as you can apply filters over one while applying effects to the other.</p>
<h3 id="03Vector-and-Shapes-2"><a href="#03Vector-and-Shapes-2" class="headerlink" title="03Vector and Shapes"></a>03Vector and Shapes</h3><p>You can use the Pen tool or Shape tool in both PS and AE that creates shape layers without losing any integrity. Both the applications support Bezier which lets you control curves between anchor points in PS and vertices in AE.</p>
<h3 id="04Destructive-Effects-2"><a href="#04Destructive-Effects-2" class="headerlink" title="04Destructive Effects"></a>04Destructive Effects</h3><p>After Effects does not provide you with destructive effects while in Photoshop you can apply non-destructive filters. You can also combine several layers to apply changes or distort your images but these permanent changes cannot be made in After Effects.</p>
<p>You will also notice that although there are several similarities, there are tools and features which are not shared between both applications. The types of tool categories would also vary. Like with After Effects, you can create paragraph and character styles that you can apply to texts.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-After-Effects-Gifs-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-After-Effects-Gifs-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs"></a>Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs</h2><p>After Effects harbors greater video editing capabilities rather than the basic animating options you can try on Photoshop. In creating a GIF, you would want to leverage the combination of tools offered on both After Effects and Photoshop.</p>
<p>Let’s first get into how you can create an animated video on After Effects and then convert it into an animated GIF in Photoshop.</p>
<h3 id="01Animating-in-After-Effects-2"><a href="#01Animating-in-After-Effects-2" class="headerlink" title="01Animating in After Effects"></a>01Animating in After Effects</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open After Effects, go to ‘Composition’ and create ‘New Composition’. You will need to fill out the dimensions and specs for your project on the window that pops up. For example, 300x250 px at 30 fps and 6 sec duration.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Decide on how many loops you want in your animation. Once you are done with your GIF, go to ‘File’ &gt; Export. Apply the Legacy Save for Web and choose the format for your GIF.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In Export options, you can gain access to several presets to apply to your animated GIFs. The more color displayed in your GIF, the larger its size. You can use Dethering to smoothen gradients and shades. Looping is also turned off on Photoshop but you can apply looping from the ‘Options’ shown at the bottom of the menu.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Ending-Thoughts-2"><a href="#Part-1-Ending-Thoughts-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Ending Thoughts"></a>Part 1 Ending Thoughts</h2><p><strong>●</strong> GIFs are a popular type of media that is quite trendy and easy to make using Adobe <strong>after effects gifs</strong> or Photoshop. They are called Graphics Interchange Format and are best used as simple graphic images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You require a combination of both Photoshop and After Effects, though both share similar interfaces, tools, and effects. You can group or nest compositions, apply filters or effects, and adjust vectors and shapes.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> After Effects is better than Photoshop in terms of creating videos, so you can first create a project in AE and then import the project onto PS after <strong>exporting after effects to gif</strong>. You can also use Filmora for the first step of this process.</p>

<p>GIFs have been around for quite some time but as the flow of content continues to plummet on popular social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, the demand for GIFs would continue to increase.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you won’t be able to <strong>make a gif in after effects</strong> directly, unless with the help of a plug-in like GIFGun.</p>
<p>Before moving forward, keep in mind that using Adobe Media Encoder is an easier method for compressing your exports rather than any third-party compressor.</p>
<p>In this article, you will find easy to follow methods using which you can create <strong>after effects GIFs</strong> within a matter of minutes.</p>

This was developed back in 1987 by a working in CompuServe.</p>
<p>This format was incredibly successful on the WEB due to benefits like smaller file sizes, broader support, and its easy compatibility with Operating Systems.</p>
<p>However, GIFs are much more suitable as simple graphics and logos rather than Live Action Videos with its palette limitation of 256 per image.</p>
<p>Creating a GIF is like looping an animation or animated elements. You can use these animated GIFs in banners to engage your audience or even create fun sharable content for your Facebook pages.</p>
<p>You can start by creating basic easy animations in Photoshop and then elevate them by using After Effects.</p>
<h3 id="02Why-create-a-GIF-3"><a href="#02Why-create-a-GIF-3" class="headerlink" title="02Why create a GIF?"></a>02Why create a GIF?</h3><p>Here are a handful of things you can keep your eye on if you are just starting on making GIFs;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Simple Product Demonstrations. With simple 3 to 4 step GIFs, you can briefly introduce steps on how to use a product.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can provide instructions in a short span of time.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> UX designers use GIFs to show the functioning of certain digital experiences.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can introduce GIFs on your page to keep followers engaged.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can display some amazing things on your website.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Difference-between-making-GIFs-in-After-Effects-and-Photoshop-3"><a href="#Part-2-Difference-between-making-GIFs-in-After-Effects-and-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Difference between making GIFs in After Effects and Photoshop"></a>Part 2 Difference between making GIFs in After Effects and Photoshop</h2><p>Creating GIFs in After Effects and Photoshop are both one in the same thing but the results may vary depending on which choice of tools and features suits you better.</p>
<p>Now, for those who are learning Photoshop and After Effects for the first time, to understand the difference in results between both these software lets familiarize you with their features in brief.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-Similar-3"><a href="#01What’s-Similar-3" class="headerlink" title="01What’s Similar?"></a>01What’s Similar?</h3><p>Since both are designed by Adobe, there are bound to be similarities in the tools and interface they use. Both these software enables you to use layers of editing from the layer panel where you separate the blending or transform multiple layers. You can apply masks to these layers in different ways on both software.</p>
<h3 id="02Groups-PS-and-Nested-AE-Composition-3"><a href="#02Groups-PS-and-Nested-AE-Composition-3" class="headerlink" title="02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition"></a>02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition</h3><p>In Photoshop, you can group layers together and apply styles, blends, and transformations together. However, in After Effects, this is called Nesting.</p>
<p>Both are in a way similar to each other but Nesting Comps give users more functionality as it interprets probable compositions during the nesting process.</p>
<p>Smart objects used in PS are also comparable to Nested Comps as you can apply filters over one while applying effects to the other.</p>
<h3 id="03Vector-and-Shapes-3"><a href="#03Vector-and-Shapes-3" class="headerlink" title="03Vector and Shapes"></a>03Vector and Shapes</h3><p>You can use the Pen tool or Shape tool in both PS and AE that creates shape layers without losing any integrity. Both the applications support Bezier which lets you control curves between anchor points in PS and vertices in AE.</p>
<h3 id="04Destructive-Effects-3"><a href="#04Destructive-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="04Destructive Effects"></a>04Destructive Effects</h3><p>After Effects does not provide you with destructive effects while in Photoshop you can apply non-destructive filters. You can also combine several layers to apply changes or distort your images but these permanent changes cannot be made in After Effects.</p>
<p>You will also notice that although there are several similarities, there are tools and features which are not shared between both applications. The types of tool categories would also vary. Like with After Effects, you can create paragraph and character styles that you can apply to texts.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-After-Effects-Gifs-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-After-Effects-Gifs-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs"></a>Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs</h2><p>After Effects harbors greater video editing capabilities rather than the basic animating options you can try on Photoshop. In creating a GIF, you would want to leverage the combination of tools offered on both After Effects and Photoshop.</p>
<p>Let’s first get into how you can create an animated video on After Effects and then convert it into an animated GIF in Photoshop.</p>
<h3 id="01Animating-in-After-Effects-3"><a href="#01Animating-in-After-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="01Animating in After Effects"></a>01Animating in After Effects</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open After Effects, go to ‘Composition’ and create ‘New Composition’. You will need to fill out the dimensions and specs for your project on the window that pops up. For example, 300x250 px at 30 fps and 6 sec duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-1.jpg"
                      alt="new composition after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can import assets by dragging and dropping, or by going to the ‘Project Panel’ in the After Effects Workspace as shown in the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-2.jpg"
                      alt="project panel after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, you can begin animating your Assets. Drag them and add them to the ‘Composition’ panel or ‘Timeline’ panel. Placing them in either one will make them appear on both. Adjust the layers according to the topmost layer on the panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-3.jpg"
                      alt="timeline panel"
                ></p>
<p>Dial down the scale of every animation to 0% so that can be animated in a growing sequence. Select the layer you wish to adjust and click on ‘Transform’. Click on ‘Scale’ to give that layer an active marker on the timeline. Set the scale to 0%.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-4.jpg"
                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>You can now begin animating the first item by moving the current time indicator to 06f (the 6th frame on the 30fps timeline). Scale the item back to 100% and the marker will reappear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-5.jpg"
                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>Repeat this for the other items. Keep in mind that each item has a 06f space between them for later adjustability.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-6.jpg"
                      alt="repeat process"
                ></p>
<p>Your equation is now complete and all that is left to do is animate your CTA button. Adjust the position of the top layer on your CTA and set the current time indicator to start time on the button animation. Click on ‘position’ to set up a marker on your Timeline. Forward the 04f then nudge the button and reverse back to the original position so that it looks like a button clicking animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-7.jpg"
                      alt="set position"
                ></p>
<p>Your animation is now complete. Now go to ‘Composition’ and shorten the time in the ‘Duration’ panel.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go to Composition. Click on Pre-Render and a new selection will pop up. Now click on ‘Render’. Your output will be a .mov file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="render after effects"

Using the adjustment layer, you can apply effects and color grading to your video clips that come beneath this layer. So, apart from adding effects and executing color correction to individual clips, you can use an adjustment layer to generate quicker results.</p>
<p>After creating an adjustment layer in any video editor, you can easily cut and extend it like any other clip. You can also remove it anytime from your timeline with a single tap. In Final Cut Pro, you cannot insert adjustment layers in its timeline directly, like in Premiere Pro or After Effects.</p>
<p>To do so, you have to use third-party tools to create adjustment layers from scratch in Final Cut Pro. The process of creating an <strong>adjustment layer in Final Cut Pro</strong> is a little bit longer compared to other editors.

In this section, you can find simple instructions to generate an adjustment layer in Final Cut Pro without hassle.</p>
<p>Step1 First, click on this <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bit.ly/3zGa5H3" >link <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download the adjustment layer in your MacBook. Once done, copy your “Adjustment Layer” folder to the “User” folder. Afterward, move it to “Movies” and then “Motion Templates.” Once done, copy it to the “Titles” folder eventually.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add the adjustment layers folder"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Now open Final Cut Pro and locate the “Adjustment Layer” under the “Titles” section. After locating it, drag and drop it into the timeline. This adjustment layer was created as a title layer in Apple Motion that got published in Final Cut Pro using the built-in publishing tools.</p>

Therefore, it is beneficial to convert those slides into digital form. There are also many benefits of this conversion such as:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Preserving the photos for future generations without the fear of getting them lost or damaged.</p>

<p>So, you might have understood why there is a need for <strong>converting slides to pictures.</strong> Now, let’s dig down more on the topic.</p>

So, let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Resolution</strong></p>
<p>The very first step for <strong>converting slides to digital photos</strong> is measuring and fixing the resolution of the slides. The technical measurement of image resolution is DPI (dot per inch). It helps you to predict the sharpness or clarity of the final image. The overall measurement depends on the size of the slide and the type of converter or scanner you are using. For example,</p>
<p>A 35 mm slide scanned at 10 MP will give you the images of size 13”*9”.</p>
<p>Step 2: Dust and Scratch Removal</p>
<p>If you have slides that have been wrapped in a box and remained untouched for so long, they might require cleaning. Such slides may develop mold buildup, age-related blemishes, or scratches. They need a cleaning process before using them to convert into slides. A lint-free cloth and an anti-static film cleaner are the best combinations to gently clean the slides and make them fresh.</p>
<p>Step 3: Color Correction and Restoration</p>
<p>Color correction and restoration is another important step when you are dealing with converting old slides into digital images. In order to correct the fading and color shift, you can use the built-in scanning software. You can also use other software for such purposes.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is the best tool which can be used for the color correction of old slides. It is a handy tool with a variety of features. Filmora offers a number of options when it comes to color correction and grading. These options include color histogram, white balance, 3D LUT (3D Lookup table), color and light, HSL, vignette, etc.</p>
<p>Step 4: Using the Best Scanner cum Digital Converter</p>
<p>The next step is choosing the best quality scanner according to the requirement. 35 mm is the most common size of the slides. But, it does come with other uncommon formats too such as 110, 126, 120, 127, etc. You will come to know about the actual size when the image is mounted on the cardboard. Therefore, it is essential to select a quality and versatile scanner which can convert slides of any size effectively.</p>

So, let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Resolution</strong></p>
<p>The very first step for <strong>converting slides to digital photos</strong> is measuring and fixing the resolution of the slides. The technical measurement of image resolution is DPI (dot per inch). It helps you to predict the sharpness or clarity of the final image. The overall measurement depends on the size of the slide and the type of converter or scanner you are using. For example,</p>

<p>Step 2: Dust and Scratch Removal</p>
<p>If you have slides that have been wrapped in a box and remained untouched for so long, they might require cleaning. Such slides may develop mold buildup, age-related blemishes, or scratches. They need a cleaning process before using them to convert into slides. A lint-free cloth and an anti-static film cleaner are the best combinations to gently clean the slides and make them fresh.</p>
<p>Step 3: Color Correction and Restoration</p>

But, it does come with other uncommon formats too such as 110, 126, 120, 127, etc. You will come to know about the actual size when the image is mounted on the cardboard.

So, let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Resolution</strong></p>
<p>The very first step for <strong>converting slides to digital photos</strong> is measuring and fixing the resolution of the slides. The technical measurement of image resolution is DPI (dot per inch). It helps you to predict the sharpness or clarity of the final image. The overall measurement depends on the size of the slide and the type of converter or scanner you are using. For example,</p>
<p>A 35 mm slide scanned at 10 MP will give you the images of size 13”*9”.</p>
<p>Step 2: Dust and Scratch Removal</p>
<p>If you have slides that have been wrapped in a box and remained untouched for so long, they might require cleaning. Such slides may develop mold buildup, age-related blemishes, or scratches. They need a cleaning process before using them to convert into slides. A lint-free cloth and an anti-static film cleaner are the best combinations to gently clean the slides and make them fresh.</p>
<p>Step 3: Color Correction and Restoration</p>
<p>Color correction and restoration is another important step when you are dealing with converting old slides into digital images. In order to correct the fading and color shift, you can use the built-in scanning software. You can also use other software for such purposes.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is the best tool which can be used for the color correction of old slides. It is a handy tool with a variety of features. Filmora offers a number of options when it comes to color correction and grading. These options include color histogram, white balance, 3D LUT (3D Lookup table), color and light, HSL, vignette, etc.</p>
<p>Step 4: Using the Best Scanner cum Digital Converter</p>
<p>The next step is choosing the best quality scanner according to the requirement. 35 mm is the most common size of the slides. But, it does come with other uncommon formats too such as 110, 126, 120, 127, etc. You will come to know about the actual size when the image is mounted on the cardboard. Therefore, it is essential to select a quality and versatile scanner which can convert slides of any size effectively.</p>

Whether you have a real mouseless experience or want to take it as a challenge, let’s get the things clear first.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to create a <strong>20 seconds</strong> music video.</li>
<li>We will only be using the footage from the <strong>stock library</strong>.</li>
<li>We will be using music from the <strong>Wondershare</strong> Filmora <strong>library</strong>.</li>
<li>We will have 5 minutes to <strong>review</strong> the footage and the music available.</li>
<li>And most importantly, we don’t have a <strong>keyboard</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1. Review your footage</p>
<p>Our first and most crucial step will be to use our imagination and creativity. So get those neurons firing, and let us go!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-3.gif"
                      alt="reviewing the footage"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Head to the <strong>stock media</strong> folder on the bar mentioned above, the Wondershare Filmora.</li>
<li>Or you can simply look towards the left window, where you will find the sample <strong>videos tab.</strong></li>
<li>Click on the sample videos tab, and a new <strong>window</strong> will appear on the library screen.</li>
<li>Here you will find almost more than <strong>20 videos.</strong></li>
<li>So apart from using the actual recorded footage, we will work our way with what we have from <strong>default</strong>.</li>
<li>For the music, we would be scrolling in the <strong>stock audio library.</strong></li>
<li>Click on the <strong>audio tab</strong> above and start <strong>scrolling</strong>.</li>
<li>You will also find some categories in the <strong>left window</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose the category of your choice and <strong>listen</strong> to the audio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do whatever suit you best. Keep in mind you only have 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Step 2. Pick music for your clips</p>
<p>Suppose you have found audio that speaks your vibe. The next step would be to find a video that tallies that audio. Let us suppose we have audio that is of the hip-hop genre. Let that creativity shine now!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drone shot of rooftops"
                ></p>
<p>If you like to add a more <strong>classical vibe</strong>, pick a classical song or audio from the audio library.</p>
<ul>
<li>After picking the song, move on to the sample videos tab and search for videos that match a <strong>classic vibe.</strong></li>
<li>Now random <strong>close-up shots</strong> of a piano, cinematic footage of a big <strong>orchestra</strong>, or simple landscapes with minimalistic movement while focusing on a single object, consider the example below.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="still shot of a bench"
                ></p>
<p>Now that a scenario is constructed, our next step is to arrange these clips in the Wondershare Filmora timeline.</p>
<p>Step 3. Download the clips and audio</p>
<p><strong>You have 15 minutes to create the music video. Start the timer!</strong> Once you have selected a sample video and audio that matches your scenario, you can <strong>download</strong> them from the bottom right icon on the thumbnail. Only if you still need to download them.</p>
<p>Step 4. Insert the audio into the timeline</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step is to drag the audio to the <strong>timeline</strong>.</li>
<li>Now play the <strong>audio</strong> from the start. If you can work with the audio as a whole, then it’s perfect.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want your audio to <strong>start</strong> at a certain point. You have to follow the below-mentioned steps. It is as simple as that!</p>

                      alt="splitting the audio on wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add</strong> your audio to the timeline.</li>
<li>Then move the <strong>timer</strong> or the slider where you want your audio to start.</li>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the audio file. Select split.</li>
<li>Your audio file will split into two parts.</li>
<li>Delete the prior file and drag the file ahead to the start of the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next step is to add the videos to the timeline.</p>
<p>Step 5. Add the video to the timeline</p>
<p>When you have your audio in the timeline, your next step is adding the video. After you have trimmed or split your audio to your wish, follow the below steps.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Click</strong> and <strong>drag</strong> to drop the video clips where you want the video to start.</li>
<li><strong>Play</strong> the audio first is a good feature for where you want your video to insert.</li>
<li>Then adjust the <strong>timeline</strong> slider on that point.</li>
<li>Simply drag your video and drop it into the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> now, remember you have multiple videos to match the audio length as we create a music video. The more, the more optimistic. Now, remember you have multiple videos to match the audio length as we create a music video. The more, the more optimistic.</p>

It has many of the features of Adobe Premiere, but it is free.</p>
<p>It supports the following formats: AVI, MP4, WMV, MKV, MOV, FLV and 3GP.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is different than most video editors in that it does not use timelines. Instead, the user edits clips in a storyboard and adds effects and titles to them. It also has an Audio Visualization feature that plays back music in your collection and shows what you’re listening to in real time. There is no voice-over tool and it is not possible to add an audio track.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora has a very large number of effects, all editable via keyframes. These include simple motion graphics such as fades and dissolves, but it also includes advanced options like motion blur and chroma-key. There are free downloadable effects, which are created by users.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora supports text editing and there is a large library of free fonts available for download on its website. It does not support green-screening&#x2F;chroma-keying. This can be done in post production via Adobe Premiere or other software.</p>

<p>This software has a very simple interface that is easy to navigate, even for beginners. The design of the program makes it intuitive enough that you can start editing videos right away without having to go through tutorials. It is easy to create the desired effects and titles that you need for your video with just a few clicks. Its editing tools are powerful enough for professional use while still being easy to learn.</p>

<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience.

<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>

<h2 id="Capture-the-moment-and-Cut-2"><a href="#Capture-the-moment-and-Cut-2" class="headerlink" title="Capture the moment and Cut"></a>Capture the moment and Cut</h2><p>CapCut is a free all-in-one video editing app that helps you create amazing videos. It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

You might have encountered these effects several times during watching YouTube videos or movies. These transitions make the videos more appealing to the audience.</p>
<p>In films, for example, the dissolve effect is employed to signify a time change. It informs viewers that there is a time difference between the two shots. You can see how this effect is used to dissolve one scene into another in the video clip mentioned below.</p>

Filmora’s top three transition effects for beginners"></a>Part 4. Filmora’s top three transition effects for beginners</h2><p>Wondershare Filmora can help video editors achieve their goals in the most basic and economical fashion. The best three transition effects that may completely transform your videos are shown below.</p>
<h3 id="Wipe-Effect"><a href="#Wipe-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Wipe Effect"></a>Wipe Effect</h3><p>Wipe transition is used to produce an apparent transformation to videos with similar frames for the before&#x2F;after comparison. Travel vloggers mostly use this effect to create a retro vibe in their videos. This transition is frequently used in movies to demonstrate the influence of time on any place.</p>
<p>The wipe effect’s fundamental goal is to transition from one shot into another via a sliding animation, giving the video an elegant vibe. For instance, we can use the wipe effect to convert the raw film to colored corrected footage.</p>
<h4 id="Steps-to-apply-the-Wipe-effect"><a href="#Steps-to-apply-the-Wipe-effect" class="headerlink" title="Steps to apply the Wipe effect"></a>Steps to apply the Wipe effect</h4><p>Step1 Drag and drop the video clip ‘before color correction’ onto the timeline’s first video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-2.jpg"
                      alt="drag and drop the video clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Then, drag and drop the color-corrected video clip on the second video track. Ensure that the clips are piled on top of one another so they may all be played simultaneously. It will make it easier for us to trim the footage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drag and drop the color-corrected video clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Place the play head where we want the transformation to begin. Then trim the second clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-4.jpg"
                      alt="place the play"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Go to the Transitions window and select “Erase slide.” Drag the transition to the start of the second video clip. Then, double-click the transition on the timeline to open the settings box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="go to the transitions window"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Adjust the length of the “Erase slide.” Let’s see how it turns out!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the length of the erase slide"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Dissolve-Effect"><a href="#Dissolve-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Dissolve Effect"></a>Dissolve Effect</h3><p>The dissolve effect allows us to shift from one shot to another by using slow block dissolution. It gives the impression that one scene is being morphed into another. And, it is frequently used in documentaries.</p>
<p>We may utilize the dissolve transition to display the differences between two video segments more naturally. To explain the objective of the dissolve effect, we used two clips of the same place shot at separate times. The first film is current, but the second is from the same place but was taken a few years back.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to apply the Dissolve effect</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Drag and drop the first video clip onto the timeline’s first video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drag and drop the first video clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Then, on the second video track, drag and drop the second video clip. Make sure the start of the second clip is where you want the transition to begin.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-8.jpg"
                      alt="drag and drop the second video clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Then Go to the Transitions window and choose the “Dissolve” effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-9.jpg"
                      alt="choose the dissolve effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Drag the transition to the start of the second video clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-10.jpg"
                      alt="drag the transition to the start of the second video clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Then, on the timeline, double-click the transition to open the settings box. If necessary, adjust the duration of the “Dissolve “ effect as needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-11.jpg"
                      alt="double-click the transition to open the settings box"
                ></p>
<p>You can see how it looks in the image below. If we play the timeline, we can watch the green court convert into the old basketball court. However, the two visuals don’t truly match each other during the transformation.</p>
<h5 id="Steps-to-adjust-the-frames-of-the-clips"><a href="#Steps-to-adjust-the-frames-of-the-clips" class="headerlink" title="Steps to adjust the frames of the clips"></a>Steps to adjust the frames of the clips</h5><p>Step1 We may fix it by adjusting the location and scale of the clips.</p>
<p>Step2 Move the play head to the transition section to watch both video segments.</p>
<p>Step3 To open the settings window, double-click on the first video.</p>
<p>Step4 Find the transform section and scale it to 110%.</p>
<p>Step5 Then, move the first video’s frame to match the second video’s placement. We may notice a more natural transition when we replay the timeline.</p>
<h3 id="Split-Screen-Effect"><a href="#Split-Screen-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Split Screen Effect"></a>Split Screen Effect</h3><p>The split-screen technique first appeared in the film “The Queen of Spades,” which was released in 1949. It depicted a man suffering from a psychological illness. The split-screen effect was used to demonstrate the contrast between reality and his hallucinations. It made the viewer more aware of what was actually happening in the film.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-12.jpg"
                      alt="split screen effect"
                ></p>
<p>Since then, the split screen has been used as the simplest technique to demonstrate the before&#x2F;after comparison. This effect is also ideal for emphasizing the changes in only one section of the video.</p>
<p>Because the split screen effect does not display the whole frame of the video clips, you may eliminate the top and bottom bars of the video clips using this effect.</p>
<p><strong>How to apply a split screen effect?</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Find “Split Screen1” in the window by clicking “Split Screen.”</p>
<p>Step2 Drag it over to the timeline.</p>
<p>Step3 You’ll see the split-screen template in the preview box when you double-click it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="split-screen template"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Drag the two video clips you wish to compare to the template’s left and right sides.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drag the two video clips"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 If necessary, you may also adjust the location of the videos in the preview clip.</p>
<p>Step6 Finally, uncheck the option labeled “allow split screen animation.”</p>

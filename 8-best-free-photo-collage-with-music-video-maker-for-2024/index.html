<p>It is definitely possible Usually, people use video collage makers for this reason. But you can also create an actual photo collage with music as well (no need to use actual video clips if you don’t want to.)</p>
<p>In the end, it all depends on the collage maker you’re using to be completely honest. In this case, the collage maker in question would have to have video editing functionalities advanced enough to allow you to create a video consisting of a picture collage with music Learn more about the different tools that you can check out below as we break down some of the best of the best available</p>
<h2 id="01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="01 Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>01 <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p>The first of the video makers that we’re going to be introducing is called Filmora. This is a professional editor that’s equipped with just about everything you need for creating high-quality video content. That includes the things that you will need in order to create a <strong>music photo collage</strong></p>
<p>For your reference, that means that you can use it to create a video showing off a picture collage with music. Usually by making use of the templates provided by the software and uploading your own images (although, in the newest version of Filmora, Filmora V11, there is a ‘Stock Media’ option that includes an endless supply of photographs, videos, music, etc. for adding to your content.)</p>

<h2 id="02-Canva"><a href="#02-Canva" class="headerlink" title="02 Canva"></a>02 Canva</h2><p>Canva is really more of a photo editor than anything else. But it has a timeline function that you can use for more advanced things. Which, in this case, would be creating a <strong>picture collage with music</strong></p>
<p>Note, just like with Filmora, Canva is not an entirely FREE program. But it is free to try. And, just like Filmora, it comes with a stock media library that you can use as a resource for your projects (i.e., images, clip arts, etc.) Canva also comes with a Pro version that you can unlock if you want some of its more advanced features (highly recommended if you’re looking to create content for work or entrepreneurial reasons and not just for posting on social media. Especially since it will allow you to collaborate with others.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<h2 id="03-Express-It"><a href="#03-Express-It" class="headerlink" title="03 Express It"></a>03 Express It</h2><p>You can say that “Express It” is Adobe’s version of Canva. It is available as an online tool and as a <strong>photo collage with music</strong> <strong>app</strong> that you can use for your smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>Much like with Canva, this program has a built-in stock media library that you can use for your projects. It’s also primarily FREE to use, although you’ll need to pay in order to unlock some of its more advanced resources. It comes with the usual layouts for creating quick templates, but it’s most prized for its ‘free-style’ mode, which will allow you to create a collage that looks exactly how you want it to look.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h2 id="04-Smilebox"><a href="#04-Smilebox" class="headerlink" title="04 Smilebox"></a>04 Smilebox</h2><p>Smilebox is an automatic video collage maker that is capable of turning photographs into a video collage without much input from you It’s the tool to use if all you’re looking for is a quick solution. By that, we of course mean the solution of the ‘upload-and-then-download’ variety</p>
<p>It is also an online tool, so Sign-Up is required. But once you’re signed up, the only thing you really have to do is provide the images that you want to use for your <strong>music photo collage</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h2 id="05-Fotojet"><a href="#05-Fotojet" class="headerlink" title="05 Fotojet"></a>05 Fotojet</h2><p>Next is ‘Fotojet’, which is an online collage maker that is incredibly popular for those that are looking for an easy solution. It works pretty much how you expect a collage maker to work. You choose from a list of ‘collage layouts’, choose the images that you want to place in the layout that you’ve chosen, pick out your music, maybe decorate the pic collage a bit (for example, you can add text, clipart stickers, etc.) and then you’re done</p>
<p>Much like some of the programs on this list, Fotojet isn’t an entirely free <strong>music photo collage</strong> tool. However, a FREE trial is available if you want to try it out for a quick project or two.</p>

                ></p>
<h2 id="06-Vimeo"><a href="#06-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="06 Vimeo"></a>06 Vimeo</h2><p>Video is a professional online photo editing tool that’s incredibly popular with entrepreneurs. It actually works very similarly with all the other tools that we’ve introduced so far. That means that it comes with templates that you can use in order to create projects, it also comes with a ‘resources’ library that you can take advantage of in order to fill up said projects</p>
<p>As for creating a <strong>photo collage with music</strong> by using this tool. You will need to sign up to start creating, but it’s FREE to try — with some elements locked under the premium version.</p>

                ></p>
<h2 id="07-Kapwing"><a href="#07-Kapwing" class="headerlink" title="07 Kapwing"></a>07 Kapwing</h2><p>KapWing is exactly what it looks like, it’s an online photo editor The best part about it is that it comes with quick collage layouts that you can use and the usual resources library. The layouts in question are customizable, allowing you to control what your <strong>music photo collages</strong> look like in the end. You also have the choice of creating said collage with photos, videos, GIFs, and music</p>

<h2 id="08-VEED-IO"><a href="#08-VEED-IO" class="headerlink" title="08 VEED.IO"></a>08 VEED.IO</h2><p>Similar to KapWing, VEED.IO offers a video collage maker that comes with customizable layouts that you can use to easily create a <strong>pic collage with music</strong>. The program is of course also free to try (though certain elements are locked in the FREE version).</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Now, however, not only can you create a moving collage (with images, videos, GIFs, etc.) but you can even add music to it</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> These types of <strong>music photo collage</strong>s are really fun to share with friends and family online. And, these days, there are even digital picture frames that will allow you to display them in your home (and yes, some of these picture frames do come with speakers for playing music)</p>

They tend to use different effects to light up their crafts. For them, editing videos with effects applications gives more life to the story. In this composition, you will learn more about Effects, and if you are just about to do your video editing right now, these details are definitely for you.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-Video-Effects"><a href="#What-are-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="What are Video Effects?"></a>What are Video Effects?</h2><p>According to the dictionary, an effect is brought about by a cause or an agency.</p>
<p>In video editing, there are a few video effects you must know to apply them to your video project. Video effects can alter the speed and produce distortions, reflections, aesthetic filters, stylistic color grading, animation transitions, and more. They can also contain 3D features like CGI. When used well, these effects improve the narrative, the atmosphere, and the images’ overall impact.</p>
<p>Let’s dissect a few of the major effects, which will be most helpful to you.</p>
<p><strong>Pans and Tilts</strong></p>
<p>Your first thought upon hearing these two words may be tripod motions. Pans and tilts are a quick way to add additional movement and sensation to your video, making it more dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>Change the Speed&#x2F;Duration</strong></p>
<p>One feature that virtually every NLE or Non-Linear Editing software gives us is the option to modify the playback speed of your video while reducing or increasing the actual duration and tempo of your segments. Slowing down your footage to match the frame rate at which the video was initially captured is one of the critical explanations for doing this.</p>
<p>To incorporate some frantic or chaotic moments into your production, you can use this to generate slow-motion shots and fast-forward effects. This effect can also quickly pan through footage for humorous effect. Find the “Speed&#x2F;Duration” option under Effects controls to accomplish this.</p>
<p><strong>Light Leaks and Flares</strong></p>
<p>Nothing gives your video a more ethereal vibe than gentle, warm light emerging from the scene. A direct source visible in the photo may be the source of this light, or it may enter the frame from the edge. You’ve probably seen these flares and leaks countless times in movies, whether they were added in post-production or resulted from the cinematographer’s lens choice. You can select where the light comes from if it doesn’t distract from the task. Remember that these spills and flares must contribute to the narrative while remaining barely perceptible to the viewer.</p>
<p><strong>Retro&#x2F;VHS Effects</strong></p>
<p>While light leaks and lens flares give your movie or film a timeless feel, nothing gives it a dated or, one would say, “scrappy” vibe. The grunge appearance of the ‘90s is in right now, and one of the most popular effects is the VHS look.</p>
<p>There are several ways to get this effect. Applying a preset, essentially a LUT (look-up table or filter), to your color grade will make the image appear fuzzier, desaturated, and blurrier (using the different alpha and gamma channels). This will cause “chroma errors,” which result from poor recordings and a lack of a flying erase head (a function that enables you to record over previously filmed video; imagine formatting your SD card while the video is still present on the card and you are simply recording over it), giving your images an outline of distorted blues and reds.</p>
<p><strong>Color Grading and Color Correction</strong></p>
<p>Besides actual editing, color grading and correction are arguably the most significant post-production steps. With the help of these tools, you may alter skin tones, highlight, and shadow levels, add vignettes, experiment with contrast, and much more. We’ll briefly go through one aspect of color grading—the ability to adjust particular colors in your image—even though this subject needs its ebook.</p>
<p><strong>Adding Overlays</strong></p>
<p>Although we’ve talked about adding overlays, such as VHS effects or light leaks, you may use many other editing overlays to add particular components to your shot, including weather particles!</p>
<p><strong>Using Titles and Motion Graphics</strong></p>
<p>Motion graphics and clean titles are essential for any video that wishes to appear professional. These could be subtitles, and the animation logo reveals post-credits, lower thirds, or even major titles. There are various free typefaces available that you may use to make your project stand out, regardless of the program you’re working in.</p>
<p>Once you’ve selected the appropriate font, color, and weight, it’s time to move on to motion graphics. These are crucial because they may transform a clear, ageless title or text into a lively, entertaining illustration of the product or concept your movie is attempting to market.</p>
<p>The abundance of tutorials nowadays makes learning the fundamentals of motion graphics a piece of cake. As I previously stated, you can access all the various effects and movements you might need, regardless of the editing program, you use.</p>
<p>These various methods and approaches need the practice to perfect, just like any other component of filmmaking. As you add these video editing effects to your editing toolkit, there will undoubtedly be a lot of trial and error. Still, eventually, they will become second nature to your workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of Applying Effects to your Video</strong></p>
<p>Almost from the first motion film, cinematic storytelling and video effects have gone hand in hand. They can improve a scene, create something that doesn’t exist, hide an error, and do much more. In essence, they assist a filmmaker in telling a tale in the manner they desire.</p>

<h2 id="Applying-Filter-effects"><a href="#Applying-Filter-effects" class="headerlink" title="Applying Filter effects"></a>Applying Filter effects</h2><p>A video filter is software that modifies a multimedia stream somehow. A filter graph is a series of filters that each accept input from an upstream filter, process the information, and then output the edited video to their downstream counterparts.</p>
<p>Step1 Click the <strong>Filter</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Step2 Choose your desired Filter effects depending on your preferred category.</p>

                      alt="apply filter movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 You can see the preview of a Filter effect by clicking it before applying it to your desired video to be edited.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step4 If you finally chose a Filter effect, drag it onto the imported video.</p>
<p>Step5 And now you will see the changes. The “star” symbol on the imported video means you have already applied a Filter effect on it.</p>

                ></p>
<h2 id="Adding-Transition-Effect"><a href="#Adding-Transition-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Adding Transition Effect"></a>Adding Transition Effect</h2><p>Transitions guide your audience.</p>
<p>From the opening to the very end, they structure the movie. There are numerous typical forms, including the wipe, dissolve, split-cut, and many others. Film editors use transitions to transfer a scene from one video clip to another practice. Transitions don’t need to be visible.</p>
<p>Step1 Click the <strong>Transition</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click transition movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Choose your desired Transition effect depending on your preferred category.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select transition movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 You can see the preview of a Transition effect by clicking it before applying it to your desired video to be edited.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/preview-filter-effect-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg"
                      alt="preview filter effect movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 If you finally chose a Transition effect, drag it between each imported video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/choose-to-add-transition-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="choose to add transition movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Now you will see this kind of symbol, which means you have already put a Transition effect between the imported videos.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> Transition effects can also be applied even if you have only one video. You can put transitions effects either at the start of the video, which could make your video introduction more appealing. Also, you can set the Transition effect at the end of the video, which could give you a pleasant closing.</p>
<p><em>Transition Effect at the start</em></p>
<p><em>Transition Effect at the end</em></p>
<p><em>Also, you can make your Transition effect longer or shorter simply by clicking this symbol then it will turn yellow. Point your cursor either on the left side of the symbol; the cursor will become a horizontal double-arrow to change the span of your Transition effect on the left video or on the right end side of the symbol to change the span of the Transition effect on the right video.</em></p>
<h2 id="Applying-Titling-Motion-Effect"><a href="#Applying-Titling-Motion-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Applying Titling Motion Effect"></a>Applying Titling Motion Effect</h2><p>Most video editing applications come with built-in titling choices, and many of them vary from basic letters to a collection of motion graphics that have already been pre-programmed. Enter your text into a template to insert them.</p>
<p>The majority of video projects have crucial titles. You can use them to build a mood, label key elements of the film, and convey information.</p>
<p>Step1 Click the <strong>Title</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select title movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Choose your desired Titling motion effect depending on your preferred category. You can also see the preview of a title effect by clicking it before applying it to your selected video to be edited.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select title motion movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 To apply the Title Motion effect, drag the effect onto the title track, just above the video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/drag-title-motion-track-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="drag title motion track movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 You can place your Title Motion effect on your desired time where you want it to appear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/customize-title-position-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="customize title position movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 To edit your Title texts, you can double-click the applied title on the title track or right-click on it and click the “edit” option. You can also edit the text by double-clicking the title portion on the current video editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-title-text-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="edit title text movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 In this step, you can edit the Title text in the “clip editing” section, as seen in the red color box. You can change the color, text style, and font size on the yellow color box. And in the green color box, you can change the alignment of the text; you can Bold it, Italizing, and make it an Underlined text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add color text title movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 You can also adjust the time duration of the Titling Motion effect in two ways. First, by clicking the Title effect from the title track and placing your cursor on either side (the cursor will become a double-headed arrow), you have to shorten or lengthen the Title effect. The second step is to click the “Clip” section and adjust the duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Maybe it was too long, or you wanted to draw out an exciting part of the video without having to watch the boring parts.</p>
<p>In this article, we will be showing you how to use FFmpeg to speed up and slow down your videos using CLI. You’ll also find some other useful FFmpeg commands that you can use on your videos.</p>
<p>Finally, we will explain how to automate these commands so that you can run them on all your videos with ease.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-FFmpeg"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is FFmpeg?"></a>Part 1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ffmpeg.org/about.html" >What is FFmpeg? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>FFmpeg is a free and open-source cross-platform software project that can record, convert, and stream audio and video. It was developed by Fabrice Bellard in 2000. It has since become one of the most popular tools for transcoding media content on Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, Windows NT, and more.</p>
<p>One of its lesser-known capabilities is to speed up or slow down videos in just about any design you can think of — with either the audio or the video synced to the other if desired.</p>
<h3 id="Uses-of-FFmpeg"><a href="#Uses-of-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Uses of FFmpeg"></a><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-ffmpeg-installation-use-cases/" >Uses of FFmpeg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>FFMPEG is a command-line tool that can manipulate and transcode video files. Its uses are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>FFmpeg can create, trim, join or separate video clips on the fly and encode them into formats including MPEG, VOB, M2TS, TS, RMVB, or AVI.</li>
<li>It can be used for Video processing, Video packaging support, Video compression, Audio, and Video container support, FFplay, and FFprobe.</li>
<li>It also has extensive options for altering the look of an image in just about any way imaginable. Whether you want to change the brightness, hue, saturation, or perform multiple operations like subsampling (resizing) without reducing quality—the list goes on!</li>
</ul>
<p>You could think of it as the Swiss army knife for video manipulation tasks. The interface might seem intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it, all commands are broken down into simple English phrases.</p>
<p>The most important thing to know before getting started with this is how to use FFmpeg’s -i and -v flags for input and output, respectively. To apply effects like slow motion playback or fast motion playback, use these flags in tandem with one another when specifying which file should be edited.</p>
<h3 id="Benefits-and-Disadvantages-of-FFmpeg"><a href="#Benefits-and-Disadvantages-of-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Benefits and Disadvantages of FFmpeg"></a>Benefits and Disadvantages of FFmpeg</h3><p>FFmpeg has many benefits over other video editing software because it is free and open source, meaning that you have access to the code so that you can modify it if needed. Thus, it’s a better option when compared to other video editing software such as Avidemux, QuickTime Pro 7, and Adobe Premiere Elements 12. Some of these benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being able to edit videos on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac OS X);</li>
<li>FFmpeg has features to speed up and slow down video;</li>
<li>Being able to convert from one format into another seamlessly;</li>
<li>An extensive amount of features are at your disposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the drawbacks are that some settings are not configurable, like with YouTube’s built-in editor. The main disadvantage, though, would be the lengthiness of the program’s installation process: not only do you need to download FFmpeg itself but also three external libraries like libx264, libmp3lame, and libfaac; then you must compile all six packages before the installation completes. Luckily this process doesn’t take very long.</p>
<p>Another possible disadvantage is the time required for downloading the various resources since they may not be readily available on standard file hosting sites such as Mediafire or Dropbox (though they can be found through third-party websites). If you’re looking for something more robust than Windows Movie Maker or iMovie, we recommend checking out FFmpeg.</p>

How to Speed Up a Video in FFmpeg?</h2><p>FFmpeg can be used to speed up videos. It’s not the only option, but it’s one of the most common ways to make your videos faster. If you want your video to be faster, then FFmpeg is the right tool for the job. Some speed-up features include: FFmpeg speed up video and audio, ffmpeg speed up video mp4, ffmpeg change video speed, and so on.</p>

<p>Step2 Drag and drop the video file onto the window.</p>
<p>Step3 This is accomplished with the command -filter:v “setpts&#x3D;.”</p>

A slider is provided for us to adjust the movie’s pacing.</p>
<p>The general speed of the film is continually increased or decreased when we choose the option for constant pace. If we choose the speed option on the screen, it gives us a built-in range of numbers that we can use to change the video’s pace in addition to presets like rapid and regular slow.</p>

<p>For Instance, when we select the “MONTAGE” preset, the video’s tempo changes based on how many keyframes we choose and at what rate. As previously stated, as the graph rises above one and falls below one, the movie’s tempo will slow down, increasing its regular speed.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to buy a pair of eyeglasses and don’t know which pair would suit your look. Now you might wish to look at how your face would look on different frames. Here you can use AR and see which pair of glasses would fit you using AR. AR can be used to share and receive various kinds of tacit knowledge. Augmented Reality is often synonymously used for “Computed-mediated reality” and “Mixed- Reality.”</p>
<p>Despite such an exceptional concept, many users raised questions about the privacy issues of this app. AR technology constantly needs to record the real environment, which involves real human beings. Recording their movement breaches their privacy which can cause legal trouble for the user. If the videos are recorded with consent, they will not harm anyone.</p>

This process involves an experience where the real or physical world interweaves with virtually created objects. It interweaves so perfectly that the artificial seems a part of the natural.

When someone looks through a VR, everything, including the object’s environment, is virtual or an illusion. When AR is used, the object is virtual, but the environment is real. Suppose you want to buy an item of furniture and you do not know whether it would match your home décor; here, you can use AR to see whether the furniture would fit your décor or not.</p>

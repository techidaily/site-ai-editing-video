<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Canva-Color-Picker"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Canva-Color-Picker" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is the Canva Color Picker?"></a>Part 1 What is the Canva Color Picker?</h2><p>Canva is one of the simplest and easiest ways of creating great and eye-catchy graphic designs. Color combinations help us to make these designs more attractive. But earlier, there were some limitations in Canva regarding the color picker tool; designers had to use browser extensions like ColorZilla to match the color combinations perfectly. They faced many problems while selecting the perfect color of their choice while designing their pins, social media content, logos, online invitations, etc. They had to find the perfect color code of their choice from an external source and paste it into the Canva, which was simply very time-consuming.</p>
<p>The most-awaited color picker tool was introduced in Canva at the end of November 202This new design tool makes the design very convenient while using Canva for graphic designing. With this tool, you don’t need to spend hours searching for the right color that matches the background. Color picker helps you to find a perfect color match according to the image, logo, or anything else uploaded on Canva.</p>

<p>But before using this new <strong>color match tool</strong>, you must ensure that:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You are using the updated version of the Canva desktop app.</p>

Color combinations help us to make these designs more attractive. But earlier, there were some limitations in Canva regarding the color picker tool; designers had to use browser extensions like ColorZilla to match the color combinations perfectly. They faced many problems while selecting the perfect color of their choice while designing their pins, social media content, logos, online invitations, etc. They had to find the perfect color code of their choice from an external source and paste it into the Canva, which was simply very time-consuming.</p>
<p>The most-awaited color picker tool was introduced in Canva at the end of November 202This new design tool makes the design very convenient while using Canva for graphic designing. With this tool, you don’t need to spend hours searching for the right color that matches the background. Color picker helps you to find a perfect color match according to the image, logo, or anything else uploaded on Canva.</p>

<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You can crop your video to a 4:3 aspect ratio to give your video more authenticity. To do this, create two “Color Matte” layers using the “New Item” icon. Name and place them over the video clip. Apply the “Crop” effect to both layers. Set the “Left” option to 86 for the first layer and the “Right” option to 86 for the second layer. Set the “Edge Feather” to 30 for both layers.</p>

Don’t worry because this guideline will provide you with the required information. These simple steps will let you add your favorite VHS look to your video using Premiere Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import your video into Adobe Premiere Pro. Open the “Lumetri Color” panel by clicking “Color” in the main toolbar. Further, choose “Lumetri Scopes” to access the graph window. Then, adjust the basic settings in the “Lumetri Color” panel. Continue to decrease the value of “Whites,” increase the “Contrast,” and set the “Blacks” to 10 on the graph.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to the “Creative” tab in the “Lumetri Color” panel. Increase the “Faded Film” and decrease the “Sharpness,” “Saturation,” and “Vibrance” to your liking. Use the color wheels in the “Color Wheels &amp; Match” section to give the right tone. Further, proceed to increase the “Vignette” value from the same tab.</p>

                      alt="change other lumetri parameters"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enable editing mode by selecting “Editing” in the main bar. Choose “Edit” from the lower section and search for the “Channel Blur” effect. Apply the effect by dragging and dropping it onto your video clip. Place the effect above previous adjustments and effects.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In the “Channel Blur” effect tab, enable “Repeat Edge Pixel” and increase “Red Blurriness” to 30. Repeat the same step but this time increase “Blue Blurriness” to 30 and “Red Blurriness” to 15 and change “Blur Dimensions” to “Vertical.”</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Continue to add the “Unsharp Mask” and “Color Emboss” effects from the “Effect” tab. Proceed and change “Amount” and “Radius” for “Unsharp Mask” to 85 and 20, respectively. Slightly increase the “Relief” values for the “Color Emboss” effect.</p>

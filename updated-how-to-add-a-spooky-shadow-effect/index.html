<p>Without further ado, let’s see the detailed step-by-step guide for this effect.</p>
<h3 id="a-Preparation"><a href="#a-Preparation" class="headerlink" title="a. Preparation"></a>a. Preparation</h3><p>You will need at least three shots of the same frame to get the shadow effect to work. The first is the main video, the second is the shadow clip, and the last would be a clip portraying just a plain background.</p>
<p>Make sure that your camera stays at the same point and angle. You can use a tripod for assurance.</p>
<p>Take the first main video and don’t forget to mark the positioning of the object for the next take. Then, you can shoot the shadow clip following the marking of the object to match its position in the main clip.</p>
<p>Finally, shoot the final clip without the object on the frame.</p>

<p><strong>5. How do I compress videos in iMovie?</strong></p>

To guide you further in the line of understanding the connection of personalities between you and your favorite anime character, here’s a comparison of some specific personality traits with their anime counterparts in what follows next:</p>
<p><strong>Specific Personality Traits: The Pragmatic Ones</strong></p>
<p>The pragmatic personality trait belongs to those who prefer a logical approach over an emotional one while making important decisions. If you have a pragmatic nature, you might stick to the straightforward attitude of looking at things, ahead of inclining towards the empathetic side. Entering into the anime world, you may find a series of characters resembling this specific aspect of your personality. One such character example is Kiritsugu Emiya from the anime series called Fate&#x2F;Zero.</p>
<p>Talking about the character in some detail, this character has a habit of sacrificing the smaller assets while hoping for bigger and greater opportunities. The habit eventually forces him to take certain painful and unwanted decisions. Mentioning a personal aspect, this one is a relatable character trait to my own personality. Considering the fact that I myself follow the line of logic to find out solutions to challenges and situations, I bear a complete resemblance with the character.</p>
<p>A downside of the pragmatic traits is their double faceted appearance to the viewers in case the latter fail to interpret the character in a correct form. It is a common assumption about these characters is that they wear a pretentious form to hide the actual aspects of personality from the onlookers.</p>

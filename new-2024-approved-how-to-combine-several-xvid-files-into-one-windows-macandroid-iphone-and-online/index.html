<ol>
<li><strong>Importing an Xvid file</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are two ways to import a Xvid file.</p>
<p> Click Import to browse for Xvid videos on your computer and select all Xvid files to load while holding down the Ctrl or Shift key. Drag and drop the Xvid file directly into the program window.</p>
<p> If you want to add images and sounds and merge them seamlessly, do that. All regular image and audio files are supported.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Drag and drop the Xvid video together</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> When you load all the Xvid files, they will appear as thumbnails in your album. To merge them, you need to drag and drop them one by one into the video timeline. They are seamlessly merged without gaps. Click the play icon to see the merged Xvid files in the screen on the right.</p>
<p> To change the order, simply drag the video element to the left or right. Note: Do not overlay another video clip. Otherwise, split and paste the original video in its place.</p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

<p>Think of a video that looks great when spliced together into two consecutive videos. This can be a similar color palette, an event or travel video, or a video of the same person. When</p>
<p>videos are uploaded, the video preview shows how they look combined. Kapwing highlights each scene with a purple box during playback.</p>

                      alt="combine-several-xvid-files-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Place the video &#x2F;photo in the desired order.</strong></p>
<p>Think about which clips are next to each other and work best, and arrange them accordingly. You can drag clips to rearrange them and delete them when you no longer need them.</p>
<p>In the menu on the left, you can choose the format of the finished video (choose 1: 1 (square)), whether to crop the video (choose Fit to Border), and the length.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="combine-several-xvid-files-"
                ></p>
<p>The video should be a montage photo Kapwing also has the option to crop the video clip to shorten the required section.</p>
<p>Creators can crop videos and remove sections from the center. To crop a clip, first select it and click Edit to open Kapwing Studio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-several-xvid-files-31.jpg"
                      alt="combine-several-xvid-files-"
                ></p>
<p>Drag both ends of the layer to change the timing of the start and end of the clip, or click the timing and use the arrow keys to make fine adjustments.</p>
<p>Besides trimming, you can look at other edits. To remove a section or add a clip in the center, use the split tool above the timeline or type “s” on your keyboard and use the shortcut.</p>
<p>Next, delete the layers you no longer need, drag the clips to combine them, and display them side by side on the timeline.</p>
<p> creators have more control over the montage by editing the scene in Studio. In Studio, you can add music to your montage,</p>
<p> insert title slides, attach endings, watermark corners, and animate.</p>

                      alt="combine-several-xvid-files-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Save the merged video</strong></p>
<p>When you have finished merging the video into the merged video, click Export Video in the upper right corner. Once the video is processed, you will be taken to the download page.</p>
<p>From here, you can save the video to your device or create a free account with your Google or Facebook login credentials to remove the watermark first.</p>

<p>For starters, it fits right into the criteria we mentioned above. It’s innovative, entertaining, vibrant, and fun and showcases all the features of Filmora 11.</p>
<p>Here, see for yourself…</p>
<p>From all the new effects to the AR sticker themes and other video editing features like speed ramping, masking, and green screen effect, the video successfully lets the audience know how creative they can get with Filmora.</p>
<p>But did you see that they didn’t put the features out there just like that! They actually used all the basic and advanced video editing features in the video to give us an idea of what it looks like when put in action.</p>
<p>And the video quality, the content, and the flow of the video speak for themselves.</p>
<p>I mean, I watched the video all the way to the end without getting bored for even a single second. And, being a video editor, I might as well get Filmora 11 after watching the highly compelling video!</p>
<p>Now, if you’re also wow-ed by the video and would like to create a similar one, here are some tips on making a successful brand video using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video"></a>Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video</h2><p>Like I said earlier, making a video is not simply about getting out your camera and starting recording. Many aspects need to be considered for your video to make the desired impact.</p>
<p>Therefore, here are some tips that might come in handy when making your brand video:</p>
<h3 id="1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience"><a href="#1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience" class="headerlink" title="1. Define Your Objective and Audience"></a>1. Define Your Objective and Audience</h3><p>The very first thing that you need to think about before starting work on your brand video is its objective and audience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/1-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Define your Objective "
                ></p>
<p>What are you trying to achieve from the video? Do you want to create brand awareness, or do you wish to promote a certain product?</p>
<p>Secondly, who’s your target audience? Is your video projected toward people who have no idea who you and your company are? Or are you addressing an existing customer base? Also, are the audience kids or adults? Because you certainly can’t make a video with cartoon characters for an audience who’s looking for something calm and relaxing, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Once you have your objective and audience sorted, it’s time to get busy!</p>
<h3 id="2-Video-Scripting"><a href="#2-Video-Scripting" class="headerlink" title="2. Video Scripting"></a>2. Video Scripting</h3><p>Based on what you’re trying to achieve from your brand video and the target audience, you can decide on the video’s script. This includes the content, the length, and the editing requirements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Video Scripting "
                ></p>
<p>Let’s take your video’s content, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re creating a video for an audience that doesn’t know you, you’ll have to start from the basics, explaining who you are, what you do, and the services you offer.</li>
<li>If you’re trying to create a video that tells your brand’s story, you can either keep it inspirational or you could create fun content that will be remembered for years to come!</li>
<li>If you’re creating something for the kids, you need to keep it short yet interesting, with many effects that help in grabbing their attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have decided what to add to the video, how long it will be, and what its content will be like, you can finally record your video!</p>
<h3 id="3-Video-Recording"><a href="#3-Video-Recording" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Recording"></a>3. Video Recording</h3><p>Now, for many people, recording simply means hitting the record button.</p>
<p>Yes, that might work for vlogs, but when it comes to making a brand video, you need to really put in effort when recording.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/3-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Record your brand video "
                ></p>
<p>For instance, you should have all the video clips and images you want to include in the video at hand. And they should resonate with your brand voice and match with each other as well.</p>
<p>If we take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video as an example, you can see that the whole video has a vibrant and warm feel to it, which can be seen throughout. It’s not that one clip is darker and the other is lighter; the whole thing sort of blends into each other.</p>
<p>That’s what you should take care of when recording your video. Make sure the background, hues, and overall feel of the video clips and images match each other.</p>
<h3 id="4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo"><a href="#4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo" class="headerlink" title="4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo"></a>4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo</h3><p>Another thing that you should keep in mind when recording is to incorporate your brand colors in the video and throw in your logo. For instance, if your brand colors are red and green, make sure to use them in the text in the video. However, if you’re not using text, you can use the colors in the video frame by having a wall or something in the background of the same colors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/4-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Use colors of your brand in your video "
                ></p>
<p>As for the logo, it can be placed anywhere in the video so that the audience learns to recognize it.</p>
<p>But why is using your brand colors and logo so important?</p>
<p>Because your brand colors and logo represent your brand and become its identity in the long run. For example, yellow and red are McDonald’s brand colors and its logo, the yellow ‘M’ in arch form, is recognizable even from a distance.</p>
<h3 id="5-Video-Editing"><a href="#5-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="5. Video Editing"></a>5. Video Editing</h3><p>Now comes the most important part of making a brand video: The editing! The part where you refine your video and add final touches to it. If you’ve got a stellar video editing software like Wondershare Filmora, it can do wonders for your video.</p>
<h3 id="Wondershare-Filmora-at-a-Glance"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-at-a-Glance" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora at a Glance"></a>Wondershare Filmora at a Glance</h3><p><img

<p>Wondershare Filmora has plenty of basic and advanced video editing features to add that wow factor to your video. It can turn a plain boring video into something fun, exciting, and watch-worthy.</p>

<p>Filmora also has many video effects, templates, speed ramping, masking, auto beat sync, voice recording, and other features that can really take your brand video to the next level.</p>

And, once you’re through with this guide, nothing can stop you from making a brand video that sells!</p>
<p>With that sorted, here are some valuable tips and ideas to help you along the way:</p>
<h3 id="1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking"><a href="#1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking"></a>1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, motion tracking means tracking the movement of an object in the video and then applying the same movement to a newly added object, like text, image, logo, or any clipart.</p>
<p>But that’s quite a common practice, right? I mean, every video editor out there is doing it!</p>
<p>However, there are some ways in which you can get creative with the motion tracking feature using Filmora.</p>
<p>Like…</p>
<p><strong>Using Motion-Tracked Texts</strong></p>
<p>While the text in a video looks pretty good itself, you can make it even more impressive by motion tracking it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach a piece of text to your introductory title. If there’s a logo or brand name in the introduction, you can add a tagline, a website address, or your Instagram or Twitter handle to it.</li>
<li>If you want to create a context for the audience, add motion-tracked captions in your brand video. This means the captions move with the movement of the subject. It looks stylish, gives relevant information, and helps tell your brand’s story without any narration.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Fitbit commercial would be an excellent example of motion-tracked captions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your video has an introductory scene where the frame is moving from one side to the other, you can motion-track the credits so that they move along with the scene and disappear gradually instead of dedicating a single clip to the credits.</li>
<li>Highlighting important aspects in a video, like places or names of objects with motion-tracked text, can make your video truly amazing and fun to watch. This would be quite essential if you’re making a video for the real estate or travel business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Hence, when working with Filmora, you can do plenty with the motion tracking feature to make a truly amazing video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers"><a href="#2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers" class="headerlink" title="2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers"></a>2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers</h3><p>Now that you know how to use the motion tracking feature in Filmora, let me tell you a secret!</p>
<p>If you incorporate face-tracking AR stickers into your video, you can succeed in creating a brand video that will have the audience glued to the screen!</p>
<p>The purpose of adding AR stickers to your videos is to emphasize reactions, portray enhanced emotions, and add an element of fun. This feature works best if you’re creating a brand video projected toward kids.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="AR sticker on face a girl using WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>So, how can you make the most of these AR stickers?</p>
<p><strong>Create Multiple Characters</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t have people to play different characters, don’t fret! With the AR sticker effect, you can create multiple characters for your video.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If your video has 3 animal characters, you can use AR stickers depicting a panda, cat, and bunny to show the different characters. Similarly, you can add the sticker with glasses to show a nerdy character. Or, if you’re really getting into the story-telling mode, you can use the pirate sticker to show a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>Magnify Emotions</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it gets challenging to portray a certain emotion in your video. This is where AR stickers come to the rescue!</p>
<p>If you want to show someone in love, you can use the heart-eyes effect. Or, if you want to show that someone is being good, you can use the angel sticker to put a halo on their head.</p>
<p>There are many options! You just have to use your creative cells and conjure up something that’s unique and stands out from the rest.</p>
<h3 id="3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect"><a href="#3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect" class="headerlink" title="3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect"></a>3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect</h3><p>A green-screen effect is quite important when it comes to making an exceptional brand video. It has been used in almost all blockbuster movies, and if you’re looking to make a video of a similar level, we’ve got some tried and tested tips to use the green screen effect to its fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Make Sure the Lighting is Even</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to a green screen, the lighting plays an important part. Make sure the green screen is one shade of green, and the lighting on the screen is even. If parts of the green screen are darker than the rest, the chroma key effect won’t be able to distinguish the different shades.</p>
<p><strong>Contrasting Colors</strong></p>
<p>Make sure the subject in the video isn’t wearing any green clothing, or there aren’t many green objects around, as they might disappear when you apply the green screen effect.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent Motion Blur with High Shutter Speed</strong></p>
<p>When shooting with a green screen background, make sure you keep the shutter speed high to avoid motion blur. Ideally, it should be 2x your frame rate for optimum results. But, at the same time, it shouldn’t be too high, as it can lead to a change in video exposure.</p>
<p>If you keep these tips in mind when shooting a video, you can easily use the chroma key effect in Wondershare Filmora to add your desired background and create an outstanding video.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects"><a href="#4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Innovative with Effects"></a>4. Be Innovative with Effects</h3><p>A video without effects is as bland as water! So, make your video innovative with the impressive variety of effects available in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>But you can’t just add effects to your video like that! You need to understand when and where to use a certain effect properly.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Tell Your Story With Split Screen Effect</strong></p>
<p>If you’re telling your brand story from the perspective of different individuals, using the split-screen effect is recommended. You can also use this effect to showcase how one thing is related to another in a cause-and-effect way.</p>
<p>Take this Lexus commercial, for example:</p>
<p>It shows the view from inside the car and from a viewer’s perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Emphasize with Pan and Zoom Effect</strong></p>
<p>As the topic of concern of this article is brand videos, the pan and zoom is an ideal effect for it.</p>
<p>You can easily emphasize its importance and give off an emotional storytelling vibe by zooming in on a person’s face or any other object in the frame. You can also use pan and zoom to add a transition to your video. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><strong>Add Thrill with Transitions</strong></p>
<p>To move from one shot to another, it’s important to add a transition effect in between. You can add different transition styles to link the shots with one another, for instance, the match cut transition to match scenes that are not otherwise linked visually. Or the whip pan transition, which involves a quick rotation of the camera’s axis to give the impression that the scene was shot in one take, although it is two separate clips.</p>
<p>Take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video, for example. You can see how seamlessly it moves from one effect to another. It adds value and makes the video fun to watch.</p>
<p>With the variety of transitions in Filmora’s library, you can add all the effects discussed above to your video for stunning results.</p>
<p>You’ve added motion tracking, used AR stickers, created a mystical background with the green screen effect, and gone innovative with effects. Now, it’s time to wrap up this article with…</p>
<h3 id="5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping"><a href="#5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping" class="headerlink" title="5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping"></a>5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping</h3><p>Did you know that speed ramping can actually improve your videos tenfold? Speeding up and slowing down the footage at certain points can have a significant impact. For example, the bullet dodge scene in “Matrix” wouldn’t have been so famous if it wasn’t for the slo-mo effect!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/7-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Speed Ramping in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>You can’t just randomly add speed ramps to your video. There has to be a purpose behind it! Do you want to emphasize something? Do you want to show a transition? Regardless, you need to time your speed ramping properly.</p>
<p>And here are a few tips for it!</p>
<p><strong>Use Slo-Mo For Action Sequences</strong></p>
<p>If your video has an amazing action scene in it, slow down the speed at that point to emphasize the action and movement. For example, a karate kick in slow motion very clearly shows us how the move is actually performed.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Use Slo-Mo For Too Long</strong></p>
<p>Another tip is to use the slow-mo only for a few seconds to emphasize something. If you prolong it, it won’t have the desired impact and might even cause the audience to lose focus.</p>
<p><strong>Speed Up Footage for Long Processes</strong></p>
<p>If your video shows a long process, like a time-lapse, it is the perfect time to speed up the footage. Not only do long shots lose the viewer’s attention, but they can also get boring too. A sped up footage on the other hand makes your video aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Add Music</strong></p>
<p>Using music in videos is quite a common practice; however, it becomes quite exciting if you speed ramp your video according to the music. For example, time the slo-mo effect with the more silent or riverbed parts of the music, and speed it up when the crescendo comes.</p>
<p>You can do this easily with the auto beat-sync feature in Filmora that matches the music with the footage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/8-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Auto beat sync in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>How’s that for a thrilling video?</p>
<p><strong>Speed Ramp for Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a bonus tip! Use speed ramping at the end of one clip and the beginning of the next one to create a seamless flow between the two. It’ll also give a transition effect and make your brand video look professional.</p>
<p>So you see, you have ample options to add a touch of creativity to your brand videos. The key is to use a good video editor and the right video editing tools.</p>

<p>What are you trying to achieve from the video? Do you want to create brand awareness, or do you wish to promote a certain product?</p>
<p>Secondly, who’s your target audience? Is your video projected toward people who have no idea who you and your company are? Or are you addressing an existing customer base? Also, are the audience kids or adults? Because you certainly can’t make a video with cartoon characters for an audience who’s looking for something calm and relaxing, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Once you have your objective and audience sorted, it’s time to get busy!</p>
<h3 id="2-Video-Scripting-1"><a href="#2-Video-Scripting-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Video Scripting"></a>2. Video Scripting</h3><p>Based on what you’re trying to achieve from your brand video and the target audience, you can decide on the video’s script. This includes the content, the length, and the editing requirements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Video Scripting "
                ></p>
<p>Let’s take your video’s content, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re creating a video for an audience that doesn’t know you, you’ll have to start from the basics, explaining who you are, what you do, and the services you offer.</li>
<li>If you’re trying to create a video that tells your brand’s story, you can either keep it inspirational or you could create fun content that will be remembered for years to come!</li>
<li>If you’re creating something for the kids, you need to keep it short yet interesting, with many effects that help in grabbing their attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have decided what to add to the video, how long it will be, and what its content will be like, you can finally record your video!</p>
<h3 id="3-Video-Recording-1"><a href="#3-Video-Recording-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Recording"></a>3. Video Recording</h3><p>Now, for many people, recording simply means hitting the record button.</p>
<p>Yes, that might work for vlogs, but when it comes to making a brand video, you need to really put in effort when recording.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/3-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Record your brand video "
                ></p>
<p>For instance, you should have all the video clips and images you want to include in the video at hand. And they should resonate with your brand voice and match with each other as well.</p>
<p>If we take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video as an example, you can see that the whole video has a vibrant and warm feel to it, which can be seen throughout. It’s not that one clip is darker and the other is lighter; the whole thing sort of blends into each other.</p>
<p>That’s what you should take care of when recording your video. Make sure the background, hues, and overall feel of the video clips and images match each other.</p>
<h3 id="4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo-1"><a href="#4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo"></a>4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo</h3><p>Another thing that you should keep in mind when recording is to incorporate your brand colors in the video and throw in your logo. For instance, if your brand colors are red and green, make sure to use them in the text in the video. However, if you’re not using text, you can use the colors in the video frame by having a wall or something in the background of the same colors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Use colors of your brand in your video "
                ></p>
<p>As for the logo, it can be placed anywhere in the video so that the audience learns to recognize it.</p>
<p>But why is using your brand colors and logo so important?</p>
<p>Because your brand colors and logo represent your brand and become its identity in the long run. For example, yellow and red are McDonald’s brand colors and its logo, the yellow ‘M’ in arch form, is recognizable even from a distance.</p>
<h3 id="5-Video-Editing-1"><a href="#5-Video-Editing-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Video Editing"></a>5. Video Editing</h3><p>Now comes the most important part of making a brand video: The editing! The part where you refine your video and add final touches to it. If you’ve got a stellar video editing software like Wondershare Filmora, it can do wonders for your video.</p>

And, once you’re through with this guide, nothing can stop you from making a brand video that sells!</p>
<p>With that sorted, here are some valuable tips and ideas to help you along the way:</p>
<h3 id="1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-1"><a href="#1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking"></a>1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, motion tracking means tracking the movement of an object in the video and then applying the same movement to a newly added object, like text, image, logo, or any clipart.</p>
<p>But that’s quite a common practice, right? I mean, every video editor out there is doing it!</p>
<p>However, there are some ways in which you can get creative with the motion tracking feature using Filmora.</p>
<p>Like…</p>
<p><strong>Using Motion-Tracked Texts</strong></p>
<p>While the text in a video looks pretty good itself, you can make it even more impressive by motion tracking it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach a piece of text to your introductory title. If there’s a logo or brand name in the introduction, you can add a tagline, a website address, or your Instagram or Twitter handle to it.</li>
<li>If you want to create a context for the audience, add motion-tracked captions in your brand video. This means the captions move with the movement of the subject. It looks stylish, gives relevant information, and helps tell your brand’s story without any narration.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Fitbit commercial would be an excellent example of motion-tracked captions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your video has an introductory scene where the frame is moving from one side to the other, you can motion-track the credits so that they move along with the scene and disappear gradually instead of dedicating a single clip to the credits.</li>
<li>Highlighting important aspects in a video, like places or names of objects with motion-tracked text, can make your video truly amazing and fun to watch. This would be quite essential if you’re making a video for the real estate or travel business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Hence, when working with Filmora, you can do plenty with the motion tracking feature to make a truly amazing video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-1"><a href="#2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers"></a>2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers</h3><p>Now that you know how to use the motion tracking feature in Filmora, let me tell you a secret!</p>
<p>If you incorporate face-tracking AR stickers into your video, you can succeed in creating a brand video that will have the audience glued to the screen!</p>
<p>The purpose of adding AR stickers to your videos is to emphasize reactions, portray enhanced emotions, and add an element of fun. This feature works best if you’re creating a brand video projected toward kids.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="AR sticker on face a girl using WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>So, how can you make the most of these AR stickers?</p>
<p><strong>Create Multiple Characters</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t have people to play different characters, don’t fret! With the AR sticker effect, you can create multiple characters for your video.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If your video has 3 animal characters, you can use AR stickers depicting a panda, cat, and bunny to show the different characters. Similarly, you can add the sticker with glasses to show a nerdy character. Or, if you’re really getting into the story-telling mode, you can use the pirate sticker to show a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>Magnify Emotions</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it gets challenging to portray a certain emotion in your video. This is where AR stickers come to the rescue!</p>
<p>If you want to show someone in love, you can use the heart-eyes effect. Or, if you want to show that someone is being good, you can use the angel sticker to put a halo on their head.</p>
<p>There are many options! You just have to use your creative cells and conjure up something that’s unique and stands out from the rest.</p>
<h3 id="3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-1"><a href="#3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect"></a>3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect</h3><p>A green-screen effect is quite important when it comes to making an exceptional brand video. It has been used in almost all blockbuster movies, and if you’re looking to make a video of a similar level, we’ve got some tried and tested tips to use the green screen effect to its fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Make Sure the Lighting is Even</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to a green screen, the lighting plays an important part. Make sure the green screen is one shade of green, and the lighting on the screen is even. If parts of the green screen are darker than the rest, the chroma key effect won’t be able to distinguish the different shades.</p>
<p><strong>Contrasting Colors</strong></p>
<p>Make sure the subject in the video isn’t wearing any green clothing, or there aren’t many green objects around, as they might disappear when you apply the green screen effect.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent Motion Blur with High Shutter Speed</strong></p>
<p>When shooting with a green screen background, make sure you keep the shutter speed high to avoid motion blur. Ideally, it should be 2x your frame rate for optimum results. But, at the same time, it shouldn’t be too high, as it can lead to a change in video exposure.</p>
<p>If you keep these tips in mind when shooting a video, you can easily use the chroma key effect in Wondershare Filmora to add your desired background and create an outstanding video.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-1"><a href="#4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Innovative with Effects"></a>4. Be Innovative with Effects</h3><p>A video without effects is as bland as water! So, make your video innovative with the impressive variety of effects available in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>But you can’t just add effects to your video like that! You need to understand when and where to use a certain effect properly.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Tell Your Story With Split Screen Effect</strong></p>
<p>If you’re telling your brand story from the perspective of different individuals, using the split-screen effect is recommended. You can also use this effect to showcase how one thing is related to another in a cause-and-effect way.</p>
<p>Take this Lexus commercial, for example:</p>
<p>It shows the view from inside the car and from a viewer’s perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Emphasize with Pan and Zoom Effect</strong></p>
<p>As the topic of concern of this article is brand videos, the pan and zoom is an ideal effect for it.</p>
<p>You can easily emphasize its importance and give off an emotional storytelling vibe by zooming in on a person’s face or any other object in the frame. You can also use pan and zoom to add a transition to your video. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><strong>Add Thrill with Transitions</strong></p>
<p>To move from one shot to another, it’s important to add a transition effect in between. You can add different transition styles to link the shots with one another, for instance, the match cut transition to match scenes that are not otherwise linked visually. Or the whip pan transition, which involves a quick rotation of the camera’s axis to give the impression that the scene was shot in one take, although it is two separate clips.</p>
<p>Take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video, for example. You can see how seamlessly it moves from one effect to another. It adds value and makes the video fun to watch.</p>
<p>With the variety of transitions in Filmora’s library, you can add all the effects discussed above to your video for stunning results.</p>
<p>You’ve added motion tracking, used AR stickers, created a mystical background with the green screen effect, and gone innovative with effects. Now, it’s time to wrap up this article with…</p>
<h3 id="5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping-1"><a href="#5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping"></a>5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping</h3><p>Did you know that speed ramping can actually improve your videos tenfold? Speeding up and slowing down the footage at certain points can have a significant impact. For example, the bullet dodge scene in “Matrix” wouldn’t have been so famous if it wasn’t for the slo-mo effect!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/7-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Speed Ramping in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>You can’t just randomly add speed ramps to your video. There has to be a purpose behind it! Do you want to emphasize something? Do you want to show a transition? Regardless, you need to time your speed ramping properly.</p>
<p>And here are a few tips for it!</p>
<p><strong>Use Slo-Mo For Action Sequences</strong></p>
<p>If your video has an amazing action scene in it, slow down the speed at that point to emphasize the action and movement. For example, a karate kick in slow motion very clearly shows us how the move is actually performed.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Use Slo-Mo For Too Long</strong></p>
<p>Another tip is to use the slow-mo only for a few seconds to emphasize something. If you prolong it, it won’t have the desired impact and might even cause the audience to lose focus.</p>
<p><strong>Speed Up Footage for Long Processes</strong></p>
<p>If your video shows a long process, like a time-lapse, it is the perfect time to speed up the footage. Not only do long shots lose the viewer’s attention, but they can also get boring too. A sped up footage on the other hand makes your video aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Add Music</strong></p>
<p>Using music in videos is quite a common practice; however, it becomes quite exciting if you speed ramp your video according to the music. For example, time the slo-mo effect with the more silent or riverbed parts of the music, and speed it up when the crescendo comes.</p>
<p>You can do this easily with the auto beat-sync feature in Filmora that matches the music with the footage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/8-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Auto beat sync in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>How’s that for a thrilling video?</p>
<p><strong>Speed Ramp for Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a bonus tip! Use speed ramping at the end of one clip and the beginning of the next one to create a seamless flow between the two. It’ll also give a transition effect and make your brand video look professional.</p>
<p>So you see, you have ample options to add a touch of creativity to your brand videos. The key is to use a good video editor and the right video editing tools.</p>
<h2 id="Wrapping-Up-1"><a href="#Wrapping-Up-1" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping Up"></a>Wrapping Up</h2><p>Shooting a brand video is easy, and it’s even easier to edit it. All you need is to let your creativity flow!</p>

<p>What are you trying to achieve from the video? Do you want to create brand awareness, or do you wish to promote a certain product?</p>
<p>Secondly, who’s your target audience? Is your video projected toward people who have no idea who you and your company are? Or are you addressing an existing customer base? Also, are the audience kids or adults? Because you certainly can’t make a video with cartoon characters for an audience who’s looking for something calm and relaxing, and vice versa.</p>

<li>If you’re trying to create a video that tells your brand’s story, you can either keep it inspirational or you could create fun content that will be remembered for years to come!</li>

<p>For instance, you should have all the video clips and images you want to include in the video at hand. And they should resonate with your brand voice and match with each other as well.</p>
<p>If we take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video as an example, you can see that the whole video has a vibrant and warm feel to it, which can be seen throughout. It’s not that one clip is darker and the other is lighter; the whole thing sort of blends into each other.</p>
<p>That’s what you should take care of when recording your video. Make sure the background, hues, and overall feel of the video clips and images match each other.</p>

Using Your Brand Colors and Logo</h3><p>Another thing that you should keep in mind when recording is to incorporate your brand colors in the video and throw in your logo. For instance, if your brand colors are red and green, make sure to use them in the text in the video. However, if you’re not using text, you can use the colors in the video frame by having a wall or something in the background of the same colors.</p>

                ></p>
<p>As for the logo, it can be placed anywhere in the video so that the audience learns to recognize it.</p>
<p>But why is using your brand colors and logo so important?</p>
<p>Because your brand colors and logo represent your brand and become its identity in the long run. For example, yellow and red are McDonald’s brand colors and its logo, the yellow ‘M’ in arch form, is recognizable even from a distance.</p>
<h3 id="5-Video-Editing-2"><a href="#5-Video-Editing-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Video Editing"></a>5. Video Editing</h3><p>Now comes the most important part of making a brand video: The editing!

And, once you’re through with this guide, nothing can stop you from making a brand video that sells!</p>
<p>With that sorted, here are some valuable tips and ideas to help you along the way:</p>
<h3 id="1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-2"><a href="#1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking"></a>1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, motion tracking means tracking the movement of an object in the video and then applying the same movement to a newly added object, like text, image, logo, or any clipart.</p>
<p>But that’s quite a common practice, right? I mean, every video editor out there is doing it!</p>
<p>However, there are some ways in which you can get creative with the motion tracking feature using Filmora.</p>
<p>Like…</p>
<p><strong>Using Motion-Tracked Texts</strong></p>
<p>While the text in a video looks pretty good itself, you can make it even more impressive by motion tracking it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach a piece of text to your introductory title. If there’s a logo or brand name in the introduction, you can add a tagline, a website address, or your Instagram or Twitter handle to it.</li>
<li>If you want to create a context for the audience, add motion-tracked captions in your brand video. This means the captions move with the movement of the subject. It looks stylish, gives relevant information, and helps tell your brand’s story without any narration.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Fitbit commercial would be an excellent example of motion-tracked captions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your video has an introductory scene where the frame is moving from one side to the other, you can motion-track the credits so that they move along with the scene and disappear gradually instead of dedicating a single clip to the credits.</li>
<li>Highlighting important aspects in a video, like places or names of objects with motion-tracked text, can make your video truly amazing and fun to watch. This would be quite essential if you’re making a video for the real estate or travel business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Hence, when working with Filmora, you can do plenty with the motion tracking feature to make a truly amazing video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-2"><a href="#2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers"></a>2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers</h3><p>Now that you know how to use the motion tracking feature in Filmora, let me tell you a secret!</p>
<p>If you incorporate face-tracking AR stickers into your video, you can succeed in creating a brand video that will have the audience glued to the screen!</p>
<p>The purpose of adding AR stickers to your videos is to emphasize reactions, portray enhanced emotions, and add an element of fun. This feature works best if you’re creating a brand video projected toward kids.</p>

                      alt="AR sticker on face a girl using WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>So, how can you make the most of these AR stickers?</p>
<p><strong>Create Multiple Characters</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t have people to play different characters, don’t fret! With the AR sticker effect, you can create multiple characters for your video.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If your video has 3 animal characters, you can use AR stickers depicting a panda, cat, and bunny to show the different characters. Similarly, you can add the sticker with glasses to show a nerdy character. Or, if you’re really getting into the story-telling mode, you can use the pirate sticker to show a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>Magnify Emotions</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it gets challenging to portray a certain emotion in your video. This is where AR stickers come to the rescue!</p>
<p>If you want to show someone in love, you can use the heart-eyes effect. Or, if you want to show that someone is being good, you can use the angel sticker to put a halo on their head.</p>
<p>There are many options! You just have to use your creative cells and conjure up something that’s unique and stands out from the rest.</p>
<h3 id="3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-2"><a href="#3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect"></a>3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect</h3><p>A green-screen effect is quite important when it comes to making an exceptional brand video. It has been used in almost all blockbuster movies, and if you’re looking to make a video of a similar level, we’ve got some tried and tested tips to use the green screen effect to its fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Make Sure the Lighting is Even</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to a green screen, the lighting plays an important part. Make sure the green screen is one shade of green, and the lighting on the screen is even. If parts of the green screen are darker than the rest, the chroma key effect won’t be able to distinguish the different shades.</p>
<p><strong>Contrasting Colors</strong></p>
<p>Make sure the subject in the video isn’t wearing any green clothing, or there aren’t many green objects around, as they might disappear when you apply the green screen effect.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent Motion Blur with High Shutter Speed</strong></p>
<p>When shooting with a green screen background, make sure you keep the shutter speed high to avoid motion blur. Ideally, it should be 2x your frame rate for optimum results. But, at the same time, it shouldn’t be too high, as it can lead to a change in video exposure.</p>
<p>If you keep these tips in mind when shooting a video, you can easily use the chroma key effect in Wondershare Filmora to add your desired background and create an outstanding video.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-2"><a href="#4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Innovative with Effects"></a>4. Be Innovative with Effects</h3><p>A video without effects is as bland as water! So, make your video innovative with the impressive variety of effects available in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>But you can’t just add effects to your video like that! You need to understand when and where to use a certain effect properly.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Tell Your Story With Split Screen Effect</strong></p>
<p>If you’re telling your brand story from the perspective of different individuals, using the split-screen effect is recommended. You can also use this effect to showcase how one thing is related to another in a cause-and-effect way.</p>
<p>Take this Lexus commercial, for example:</p>
<p>It shows the view from inside the car and from a viewer’s perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Emphasize with Pan and Zoom Effect</strong></p>
<p>As the topic of concern of this article is brand videos, the pan and zoom is an ideal effect for it.</p>
<p>You can easily emphasize its importance and give off an emotional storytelling vibe by zooming in on a person’s face or any other object in the frame. You can also use pan and zoom to add a transition to your video. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><strong>Add Thrill with Transitions</strong></p>
<p>To move from one shot to another, it’s important to add a transition effect in between. You can add different transition styles to link the shots with one another, for instance, the match cut transition to match scenes that are not otherwise linked visually. Or the whip pan transition, which involves a quick rotation of the camera’s axis to give the impression that the scene was shot in one take, although it is two separate clips.</p>
<p>Take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video, for example. You can see how seamlessly it moves from one effect to another. It adds value and makes the video fun to watch.</p>
<p>With the variety of transitions in Filmora’s library, you can add all the effects discussed above to your video for stunning results.</p>
<p>You’ve added motion tracking, used AR stickers, created a mystical background with the green screen effect, and gone innovative with effects. Now, it’s time to wrap up this article with…</p>
<h3 id="5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping-2"><a href="#5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping"></a>5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping</h3><p>Did you know that speed ramping can actually improve your videos tenfold? Speeding up and slowing down the footage at certain points can have a significant impact. For example, the bullet dodge scene in “Matrix” wouldn’t have been so famous if it wasn’t for the slo-mo effect!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/7-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Speed Ramping in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>You can’t just randomly add speed ramps to your video. There has to be a purpose behind it! Do you want to emphasize something? Do you want to show a transition? Regardless, you need to time your speed ramping properly.</p>
<p>And here are a few tips for it!</p>
<p><strong>Use Slo-Mo For Action Sequences</strong></p>
<p>If your video has an amazing action scene in it, slow down the speed at that point to emphasize the action and movement. For example, a karate kick in slow motion very clearly shows us how the move is actually performed.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Use Slo-Mo For Too Long</strong></p>
<p>Another tip is to use the slow-mo only for a few seconds to emphasize something. If you prolong it, it won’t have the desired impact and might even cause the audience to lose focus.</p>
<p><strong>Speed Up Footage for Long Processes</strong></p>
<p>If your video shows a long process, like a time-lapse, it is the perfect time to speed up the footage. Not only do long shots lose the viewer’s attention, but they can also get boring too. A sped up footage on the other hand makes your video aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Add Music</strong></p>
<p>Using music in videos is quite a common practice; however, it becomes quite exciting if you speed ramp your video according to the music. For example, time the slo-mo effect with the more silent or riverbed parts of the music, and speed it up when the crescendo comes.</p>
<p>You can do this easily with the auto beat-sync feature in Filmora that matches the music with the footage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/8-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Auto beat sync in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>How’s that for a thrilling video?</p>
<p><strong>Speed Ramp for Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a bonus tip! Use speed ramping at the end of one clip and the beginning of the next one to create a seamless flow between the two. It’ll also give a transition effect and make your brand video look professional.</p>
<p>So you see, you have ample options to add a touch of creativity to your brand videos. The key is to use a good video editor and the right video editing tools.</p>

<h2 id="Wondershare-Filmora’s-Brand-Video-3"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora’s-Brand-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora’s Brand Video"></a>Wondershare Filmora’s Brand Video</h2><p>What’s so special about it, you ask?</p>

<p>Now, if you’re also wow-ed by the video and would like to create a similar one, here are some tips on making a successful brand video using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video-3"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video"></a>Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video</h2><p>Like I said earlier, making a video is not simply about getting out your camera and starting recording. Many aspects need to be considered for your video to make the desired impact.</p>
<p>Therefore, here are some tips that might come in handy when making your brand video:</p>
<h3 id="1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience-3"><a href="#1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Define Your Objective and Audience"></a>1. Define Your Objective and Audience</h3><p>The very first thing that you need to think about before starting work on your brand video is its objective and audience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/1-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Define your Objective "
                ></p>
<p>What are you trying to achieve from the video? Do you want to create brand awareness, or do you wish to promote a certain product?</p>
<p>Secondly, who’s your target audience? Is your video projected toward people who have no idea who you and your company are? Or are you addressing an existing customer base? Also, are the audience kids or adults? Because you certainly can’t make a video with cartoon characters for an audience who’s looking for something calm and relaxing, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Once you have your objective and audience sorted, it’s time to get busy!</p>
<h3 id="2-Video-Scripting-3"><a href="#2-Video-Scripting-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Video Scripting"></a>2. Video Scripting</h3><p>Based on what you’re trying to achieve from your brand video and the target audience, you can decide on the video’s script. This includes the content, the length, and the editing requirements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Video Scripting "
                ></p>
<p>Let’s take your video’s content, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re creating a video for an audience that doesn’t know you, you’ll have to start from the basics, explaining who you are, what you do, and the services you offer.</li>
<li>If you’re trying to create a video that tells your brand’s story, you can either keep it inspirational or you could create fun content that will be remembered for years to come!</li>
<li>If you’re creating something for the kids, you need to keep it short yet interesting, with many effects that help in grabbing their attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have decided what to add to the video, how long it will be, and what its content will be like, you can finally record your video!</p>
<h3 id="3-Video-Recording-3"><a href="#3-Video-Recording-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Recording"></a>3. Video Recording</h3><p>Now, for many people, recording simply means hitting the record button.</p>
<p>Yes, that might work for vlogs, but when it comes to making a brand video, you need to really put in effort when recording.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/3-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Record your brand video "
                ></p>
<p>For instance, you should have all the video clips and images you want to include in the video at hand. And they should resonate with your brand voice and match with each other as well.</p>
<p>If we take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video as an example, you can see that the whole video has a vibrant and warm feel to it, which can be seen throughout. It’s not that one clip is darker and the other is lighter; the whole thing sort of blends into each other.</p>
<p>That’s what you should take care of when recording your video. Make sure the background, hues, and overall feel of the video clips and images match each other.</p>
<h3 id="4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo-3"><a href="#4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo"></a>4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo</h3><p>Another thing that you should keep in mind when recording is to incorporate your brand colors in the video and throw in your logo. For instance, if your brand colors are red and green, make sure to use them in the text in the video. However, if you’re not using text, you can use the colors in the video frame by having a wall or something in the background of the same colors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Use colors of your brand in your video "
                ></p>
<p>As for the logo, it can be placed anywhere in the video so that the audience learns to recognize it.</p>
<p>But why is using your brand colors and logo so important?</p>
<p>Because your brand colors and logo represent your brand and become its identity in the long run. For example, yellow and red are McDonald’s brand colors and its logo, the yellow ‘M’ in arch form, is recognizable even from a distance.</p>

<h2 id="Creative-Ideas-to-Make-Brand-Videos-Using-Filmora-3"><a href="#Creative-Ideas-to-Make-Brand-Videos-Using-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Creative Ideas to Make Brand Videos Using Filmora"></a>Creative Ideas to Make Brand Videos Using Filmora</h2><p>If you’re up for making a video just like the video we shared earlier, you’ll need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Wondershare Filmora from the website. And, once you’re through with this guide, nothing can stop you from making a brand video that sells!</p>
<p>With that sorted, here are some valuable tips and ideas to help you along the way:</p>
<h3 id="1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-3"><a href="#1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking"></a>1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, motion tracking means tracking the movement of an object in the video and then applying the same movement to a newly added object, like text, image, logo, or any clipart.</p>
<p>But that’s quite a common practice, right? I mean, every video editor out there is doing it!</p>
<p>However, there are some ways in which you can get creative with the motion tracking feature using Filmora.</p>
<p>Like…</p>
<p><strong>Using Motion-Tracked Texts</strong></p>
<p>While the text in a video looks pretty good itself, you can make it even more impressive by motion tracking it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach a piece of text to your introductory title. If there’s a logo or brand name in the introduction, you can add a tagline, a website address, or your Instagram or Twitter handle to it.</li>
<li>If you want to create a context for the audience, add motion-tracked captions in your brand video. This means the captions move with the movement of the subject. It looks stylish, gives relevant information, and helps tell your brand’s story without any narration.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Fitbit commercial would be an excellent example of motion-tracked captions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your video has an introductory scene where the frame is moving from one side to the other, you can motion-track the credits so that they move along with the scene and disappear gradually instead of dedicating a single clip to the credits.</li>
<li>Highlighting important aspects in a video, like places or names of objects with motion-tracked text, can make your video truly amazing and fun to watch. This would be quite essential if you’re making a video for the real estate or travel business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Hence, when working with Filmora, you can do plenty with the motion tracking feature to make a truly amazing video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-3"><a href="#2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers"></a>2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers</h3><p>Now that you know how to use the motion tracking feature in Filmora, let me tell you a secret!</p>
<p>If you incorporate face-tracking AR stickers into your video, you can succeed in creating a brand video that will have the audience glued to the screen!</p>
<p>The purpose of adding AR stickers to your videos is to emphasize reactions, portray enhanced emotions, and add an element of fun. This feature works best if you’re creating a brand video projected toward kids.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/6-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="AR sticker on face a girl using WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>So, how can you make the most of these AR stickers?</p>
<p><strong>Create Multiple Characters</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t have people to play different characters, don’t fret! With the AR sticker effect, you can create multiple characters for your video.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If your video has 3 animal characters, you can use AR stickers depicting a panda, cat, and bunny to show the different characters. Similarly, you can add the sticker with glasses to show a nerdy character. Or, if you’re really getting into the story-telling mode, you can use the pirate sticker to show a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>Magnify Emotions</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it gets challenging to portray a certain emotion in your video. This is where AR stickers come to the rescue!</p>
<p>If you want to show someone in love, you can use the heart-eyes effect. Or, if you want to show that someone is being good, you can use the angel sticker to put a halo on their head.</p>
<p>There are many options! You just have to use your creative cells and conjure up something that’s unique and stands out from the rest.</p>
<h3 id="3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-3"><a href="#3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect"></a>3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect</h3><p>A green-screen effect is quite important when it comes to making an exceptional brand video. It has been used in almost all blockbuster movies, and if you’re looking to make a video of a similar level, we’ve got some tried and tested tips to use the green screen effect to its fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Make Sure the Lighting is Even</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to a green screen, the lighting plays an important part. Make sure the green screen is one shade of green, and the lighting on the screen is even. If parts of the green screen are darker than the rest, the chroma key effect won’t be able to distinguish the different shades.</p>
<p><strong>Contrasting Colors</strong></p>
<p>Make sure the subject in the video isn’t wearing any green clothing, or there aren’t many green objects around, as they might disappear when you apply the green screen effect.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent Motion Blur with High Shutter Speed</strong></p>
<p>When shooting with a green screen background, make sure you keep the shutter speed high to avoid motion blur. Ideally, it should be 2x your frame rate for optimum results. But, at the same time, it shouldn’t be too high, as it can lead to a change in video exposure.</p>
<p>If you keep these tips in mind when shooting a video, you can easily use the chroma key effect in Wondershare Filmora to add your desired background and create an outstanding video.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-3"><a href="#4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Innovative with Effects"></a>4. Be Innovative with Effects</h3><p>A video without effects is as bland as water! So, make your video innovative with the impressive variety of effects available in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>But you can’t just add effects to your video like that! You need to understand when and where to use a certain effect properly.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Tell Your Story With Split Screen Effect</strong></p>
<p>If you’re telling your brand story from the perspective of different individuals, using the split-screen effect is recommended. You can also use this effect to showcase how one thing is related to another in a cause-and-effect way.</p>
<p>Take this Lexus commercial, for example:</p>
<p>It shows the view from inside the car and from a viewer’s perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Emphasize with Pan and Zoom Effect</strong></p>
<p>As the topic of concern of this article is brand videos, the pan and zoom is an ideal effect for it.</p>
<p>You can easily emphasize its importance and give off an emotional storytelling vibe by zooming in on a person’s face or any other object in the frame. You can also use pan and zoom to add a transition to your video. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><strong>Add Thrill with Transitions</strong></p>
<p>To move from one shot to another, it’s important to add a transition effect in between. You can add different transition styles to link the shots with one another, for instance, the match cut transition to match scenes that are not otherwise linked visually. Or the whip pan transition, which involves a quick rotation of the camera’s axis to give the impression that the scene was shot in one take, although it is two separate clips.</p>
<p>Take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video, for example. You can see how seamlessly it moves from one effect to another. It adds value and makes the video fun to watch.</p>
<p>With the variety of transitions in Filmora’s library, you can add all the effects discussed above to your video for stunning results.</p>
<p>You’ve added motion tracking, used AR stickers, created a mystical background with the green screen effect, and gone innovative with effects. Now, it’s time to wrap up this article with…</p>
<h3 id="5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping-3"><a href="#5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping"></a>5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping</h3><p>Did you know that speed ramping can actually improve your videos tenfold? Speeding up and slowing down the footage at certain points can have a significant impact. For example, the bullet dodge scene in “Matrix” wouldn’t have been so famous if it wasn’t for the slo-mo effect!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/7-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Speed Ramping in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>You can’t just randomly add speed ramps to your video. There has to be a purpose behind it! Do you want to emphasize something? Do you want to show a transition? Regardless, you need to time your speed ramping properly.</p>
<p>And here are a few tips for it!</p>
<p><strong>Use Slo-Mo For Action Sequences</strong></p>
<p>If your video has an amazing action scene in it, slow down the speed at that point to emphasize the action and movement. For example, a karate kick in slow motion very clearly shows us how the move is actually performed.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Use Slo-Mo For Too Long</strong></p>
<p>Another tip is to use the slow-mo only for a few seconds to emphasize something. If you prolong it, it won’t have the desired impact and might even cause the audience to lose focus.</p>
<p><strong>Speed Up Footage for Long Processes</strong></p>
<p>If your video shows a long process, like a time-lapse, it is the perfect time to speed up the footage. Not only do long shots lose the viewer’s attention, but they can also get boring too. A sped up footage on the other hand makes your video aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Add Music</strong></p>
<p>Using music in videos is quite a common practice; however, it becomes quite exciting if you speed ramp your video according to the music. For example, time the slo-mo effect with the more silent or riverbed parts of the music, and speed it up when the crescendo comes.</p>
<p>You can do this easily with the auto beat-sync feature in Filmora that matches the music with the footage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/8-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Auto beat sync in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>How’s that for a thrilling video?</p>
<p><strong>Speed Ramp for Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a bonus tip! Use speed ramping at the end of one clip and the beginning of the next one to create a seamless flow between the two. It’ll also give a transition effect and make your brand video look professional.</p>
<p>So you see, you have ample options to add a touch of creativity to your brand videos. The key is to use a good video editor and the right video editing tools.</p>
<h2 id="Wrapping-Up-3"><a href="#Wrapping-Up-3" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping Up"></a>Wrapping Up</h2><p>Shooting a brand video is easy, and it’s even easier to edit it. All you need is to let your creativity flow!</p>

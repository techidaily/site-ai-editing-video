Also, Know the Tools Available to Make the Conversion</h2><p>One of the primary things that differentiate a good video from a low-quality one is its frame rate or burst rate. This refers to the frequency of a series of images or frames consecutively appearing during display. A low frame rate per second or FPS causes issues in most display screens, so you will need a <strong>60 FPS video converter</strong> to update it.</p>
<p>You need to <strong>convert or make video 60FPS online</strong> through tools and software to improve the sharpness of frame speed and make it suitable for streaming sites like YouTube that play 60FPS only or create UHD&#x2F;4K videos. Plus, most high-definition screens for gaming, computers, tablets, and smartphones require high FPS.</p>
<p>This article will teach you the best solutions to make the conversion possible. Choose your option after a full evaluation.</p>

What does 60 FPS mean?</h2><p>Before discussing the best tools available for frame rate conversion, you should know what frame rate is. Also known as update rate, this signifies the frequency of the display of consecutive series of frames or images. The speed of how they appear determines the fluid play of the video with no interruption or lag.</p>
<p>In the context of video and film cameras, motion capture systems, and computer graphics, you should try to <strong>convert video to 60FPS</strong>. There are multiple types available, like the low 24FPS or 30FPS or the higher 60FPS or 120FPS. 60FPS is the most accepted option for diverse operating systems, screens, and graphics.</p>

<h3 id="Why-Should-You-Convert-Videos-into-60FPS"><a href="#Why-Should-You-Convert-Videos-into-60FPS" class="headerlink" title="Why Should You Convert Videos into 60FPS?"></a>Why Should You Convert Videos into 60FPS?</h3><p>In the context of video FPS, the three variations- 30FPS, 60FPS, and 24FPS are the most common. However, there are specific reasons why 60FPS is the best option you should use, and take the time to convert your files with this frame rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Playing 24FPS or 30FPS videos on LCD screens have more prominent motion blur, the sharpness of transition is low and rough, etc.</li>
<li>Well-known streaming sites like YouTube set their standard for videos at 60FPS. If you use a file with a higher FPS, it will compress to 60FPS automatically. Anything lower than that is unacceptable since it creates a laggy video transition.</li>
<li>Creating high-quality movies in UHD or 4K resolution requires a high FPS like 60FPS. Movies shot with 24FPS do not assure the best display in the native frame rate and need pulldown conversion. This causes judder, which affects video quality. Converting the video to <strong>60fps ai online</strong> is a better choice.</li>
<li>Modern devices like computers, smartphones, and tablets have a high refresh rate. So, these, including some gaming monitors and television varieties, accept videos with 60FPS best.</li>
<li>In animation, most creators run 3-4 images per drawing, which means 6 or 8 drawings per second. For the best transition between shorts and images, converting the animation videos to 60FPS is useful.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Indeed, adjusting the frame rate of your video will help you create high-quality videos with a fluid and lag-less transition. You should convert your file to 60FPS if it is a lower version at the time to improve sharpness and make it compatible with most screen types, 4K movie playing, and streaming.</p>
<p>Use the available online and native software options to make these changes quickly and efficiently. Additionally, if you want to create a file directly at 60FPS, you can do so using Filmora.</p>
<p>Give these tools a try first to get a better experience with the features and process.</p>
<p>Why Should You Convert Videos into 60FPS?</p>
<p>In the context of video FPS, the three variations- 30FPS, 60FPS, and 24FPS are the most common. However, there are specific reasons why 60FPS is the best option you should use, and take the time to convert your files with this frame rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Playing 24FPS or 30FPS videos on LCD screens have more prominent motion blur, the sharpness of transition is low and rough, etc.</li>
<li>Well-known streaming sites like YouTube set their standard for videos at 60FPS. If you use a file with a higher FPS, it will compress to 60FPS automatically. Anything lower than that is unacceptable since it creates a laggy video transition.</li>
<li>Creating high-quality movies in UHD or 4K resolution requires a high FPS like 60FPS. Movies shot with 24FPS do not assure the best display in the native frame rate and need pulldown conversion. This causes judder, which affects video quality. Converting the video to <strong>60fps ai online</strong> is a better choice.</li>
<li>Modern devices like computers, smartphones, and tablets have a high refresh rate. So, these, including some gaming monitors and television varieties, accept videos with 60FPS best.</li>
<li>In animation, most creators run 3-4 images per drawing, which means 6 or 8 drawings per second. For the best transition between shorts and images, converting the animation videos to 60FPS is useful.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to Make an End Screen with Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Creating an end screen for your YouTube video using Filmora is a very simple process. Use these steps to do it;</p>
<p>Step 1: The first thing you need to do is install Filmora on your computer. You can download the setup file from the main website and then follow the instructions on the setup wizard to install the program.</p>
<p>Once the installation is complete, open the program and click on “New Project” to start.</p>
<p>Step 2: Click on the “Titles” section and search for “End Screen” using the search bar. Select the best template for your end screen and drag it into the timeline.</p>
<p>Step 3: Now you are ready to add elements to the end screen. Add your profile picture on a new track across the timeline and stretch it to fit the screen as desired.</p>
<p>Step 4: Click on “Effects” and use the search function to search for the “Mask” effect. When you find it, add it across the timeline and double-click on it to open its settings and adjust the effect accordingly.</p>
<p>Step 5: You may also want to add your social media handles to the end screen. To do that, use the “Titles” tab to find the different social media handles and add each one to the timeline.</p>
<p>You are now ready to save and export the end screen and add it to your YouTube video.</p>
<h2 id="Related-FAQs-About-End-Screen-Maker-3"><a href="#Related-FAQs-About-End-Screen-Maker-3" class="headerlink" title="Related FAQs About End Screen Maker"></a>Related FAQs About End Screen Maker</h2><p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>How Do You Make an End Screen?</strong></p>
<p>Making an end screen is different depending on the tool that you use to create the end screen as well as the number of elements that you choose to add to it. But usually, you would start with a template and begin adding elements to the project one by one.</p>
<p><strong>2.What is the Best Free Outro Maker?</strong></p>
<p>The best tool to create an end screen for YouTube videos is Filmora simply because it makes the process very easy while allowing you to customize your creation as much as you need. But even though it has a free trial version, most of the features you need to create a unique end screen are not available on the free plan.</p>
<p>A good free solution would be Canva because it has numerous free resources that can create a decent end screen. Although we must point out that many of the best templates and elements on Canva are also not available for free.</p>
<p><strong>3.How Long can a YouTube End Screen Be?</strong></p>
<p>A typical end screen is often 5-20 seconds long. You don’t need any more than 20 seconds because it is only used as a way to promote additional content or add a call to action. So when creating an End screen, ensure that all elements are clear enough as your audience will have only 20 seconds to see it.</p>
<p>Even though it is just 20 seconds long, the end screen of your YouTube video can be the most important aspect of the entire video. It is a great way to further engage with your audience and with the tools on</p>
<p>this list, you can now create the best end screen for your video.</p>

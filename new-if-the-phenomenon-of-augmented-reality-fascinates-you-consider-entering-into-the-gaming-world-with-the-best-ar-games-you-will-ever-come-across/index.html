The mask is the portion of the video you’ve chosen to pick, either with a template or a custom frame. The mask then becomes isolated, and you may modify it as desired to produce your intended effect.</p>
<p>Masks may be used to do some fantastic things with your videos. You can clone people or objects, overlay several pictures, create glitch effects, blur faces out, etc. Masks add a lot of excitement and color to videos, making them more dynamic, enjoyable to watch, and professional. It can draw attention - and keep it!</p>
<h3 id="Different-types-of-masking"><a href="#Different-types-of-masking" class="headerlink" title="Different types of masking"></a>Different types of masking</h3><p>There are three primary types of masking: rotoscoping, chroma-keying, and motion tracking.</p>
<p>Rotoscoping: Rotoscoping is the process of manually tracing an object in a video frame by frame to create a mask. This can be a time-consuming process, but it allows for very precise control over the masked area.</p>
<p>Chroma-keying: Chroma-keying is a type of masking that makes use of color to isolate a particular area of the frame. For example, this is often used to remove a green or blue screen from the footage, but can also be used to isolate other colors.</p>
<p>Motion tracking: Motion tracking is a masking technique that allows you to track the movement of an object in a video clip. This is often used to add special effects, such as explosions, to a video.</p>

<p>Masking video editing is the process of hiding or obscuring certain elements in a video clip. This can be done for aesthetic purposes and is often used to remove unwanted objects or blemishes from the footage. Masking can be accomplished using a variety of methods, including rotoscoping, chroma-keying, and motion tracking.</p>

The mask is the portion of the video you’ve chosen to pick, either with a template or a custom frame. The mask then becomes isolated, and you may modify it as desired to produce your intended effect.</p>
<p>Masks may be used to do some fantastic things with your videos. You can clone people or objects, overlay several pictures, create glitch effects, blur faces out, etc. Masks add a lot of excitement and color to videos, making them more dynamic, enjoyable to watch, and professional. It can draw attention - and keep it!</p>
<h3 id="Different-types-of-masking-3"><a href="#Different-types-of-masking-3" class="headerlink" title="Different types of masking"></a>Different types of masking</h3><p>There are three primary types of masking: rotoscoping, chroma-keying, and motion tracking.</p>
<p>Rotoscoping: Rotoscoping is the process of manually tracing an object in a video frame by frame to create a mask. This can be a time-consuming process, but it allows for very precise control over the masked area.</p>
<p>Chroma-keying: Chroma-keying is a type of masking that makes use of color to isolate a particular area of the frame. For example, this is often used to remove a green or blue screen from the footage, but can also be used to isolate other colors.</p>
<p>Motion tracking: Motion tracking is a masking technique that allows you to track the movement of an object in a video clip. This is often used to add special effects, such as explosions, to a video.</p>

<p>Use the left-hand slider or the resizing box in the preview window on the right to change the size and placement of your media in your panel video mask.</p>

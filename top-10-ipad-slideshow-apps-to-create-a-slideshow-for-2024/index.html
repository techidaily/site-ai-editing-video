<p><strong>●</strong> Keep a good balance between the text and the images so that it does not look weird.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The color and the font of the text are among the most important factors to be considered. Make sure that both the text color as well as the font match and blend well with the theme and the images in the collage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Keeping the background of the text simple, less detailed, and also clutter-free is important so that the text content comes out nicely.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make sure only to add a few words or lines in your collage to make it look sophisticated. It’s majorly a photo collage with a dash of the text so keep it that way only and not vice-versa.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Keep a good balance between the text and the images so that it does not look weird.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The color and the font of the text are among the most important factors to be considered. Make sure that both the text color as well as the font match and blend well with the theme and the images in the collage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Keeping the background of the text simple, less detailed, and also clutter-free is important so that the text content comes out nicely.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make sure only to add a few words or lines in your collage to make it look sophisticated. It’s majorly a photo collage with a dash of the text so keep it that way only and not vice-versa.</p>
